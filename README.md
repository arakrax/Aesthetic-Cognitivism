#### Introduction:

This project aims to analyse a substantial dataset of approximately half a million arts review articles (students may work on a subset of the data). This rich textual resource offers a unique opportunity to explore the language used in art criticism, identify key entities such as artists and art categories, and uncover underlying conceptual themes and their relative importance.



#### Project goals and objectives:

The primary goal of this project is to extract meaningful information and patterns from a large corpus of art critiques. **The specific objectives include:**





### Pre processing pipeline:

Creating a robust pre processing pipeline to clean the data from unwanted charactes (OCR) and misspellings while minimising the risk of affecting the text content.

### Art Category Extraction:

To explore and apply strategies for categorizing the artwork discussed in the critiques (e.g., painting, sculpture, photography).

### Temporal Analysis:

To explore how the language and focus of criticism may have evolved over time (if date information is available).
