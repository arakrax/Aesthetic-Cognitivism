Stamen’s Hospital Society.—This most benevolent institution celebrated its fourth anniversary festival yesterday, at the City of London Tavern. Wm. Manning, Esq., M.P., was called to the chair, in the absence of Ivord Melville, who was prevented from being present bv his public duties.. It was attended by ViceAdmiral Sir Richard King, Rear Admiral Douglas, Captain Sir G.Wcstpha!, R.N-, Captain Sir C. Sullivan, R.N., SirF. Ommanny, Bart., M.P., Sir Wm. Kay, Bart., the Rev. Sir 3. C. Jervoise. Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt, Sir Janies Little, and several officers Of the naw, and gentlemen of distinction. It appeared from the report of the "committee, that at the period when this charity was first instituted four years ago, the number of seamen destitute of medical advice, in the pottos London, was ascertained to be from 7 to 800. In that year (1821), 413 were received into the Hospital; since then the number has increased gradually; and last year it amounted to no less than 1,249; to support the expense of this number, however, amounting to 3,5001. a-year, the resources of the Society arc wholly inadequate,'—their funds consisting only of the interest of 3,0601. stock; and the annual subscriptions, about 1,0001. each. In the course of the evening several appeals in behalf of poor sick seamen were made to the humanity of the assembly and to the public in general; and more particularly to the consideration of the merchants, who, owing to the circumstances of the institution and its objects not being sufficiently known to them, had not yet qpmc forward with that liberality for which they arc so conspicious on all charitable occasions. It was therefore hoped, that as the institution would acquire notoriety, that alone being necessary to procure for it the countenance and support of every charitable individual, the contributions would increase, and the funds be thus rendered sufficient to continue the rcceptisn of the present number of poor seamen; and prevent the necessity of shutting the doors of the hospital in future upon so many of this most deserving class of men, and leaving them to their miserable fate at a time when they stood in greatest need of aid and attention. Amongst the subscriptions announced by the treasurer, many were from gentlemen of the East Indies.
The Recorder of London yesterday made his. report to the King in Council of the following prisoners under sentence of death in Newgate, and who were convicted at the December Old Bailey Sessions, namely—Lot Cartlidgc, aged 49; Mary Ann Rycroft, 35; Charles Metzger, 19; William Lilley, 21; Hannah Harriet Burton, 42; Elizabeth Bowslcy, 13; Caroline Molineux, 12; and William Harrison, 21; for stealing in a dwelling-house to the amount of 40s. and upwards: all of whom His Majesty was graciously pleased to respite during Iris Royal pleasure. The cases of Edward Harris, for highway robbery; Levi Abrahams, for burglary ; and Robert Ball, for arson, arc postponed until a future report". None of the cases in January sessions were reported.
An inquest was yesterday morning taken before T. Stirling, Esq., at St., Giles’s Workhouse, on the body of Joseph Keaton, whose death was the result of violence used towards him by his wife, and for which she is now in custody. Ths jury returned a verdict of “- Wilful murder against his wife, Mary Keaton."
A couple of villains, whose respectable appearance renders them unsuspected, have lately been practising an artful and cruel species of robbery. They are accustomed to visit various Almshouses, under colour of being employed by the trustees to inspect tlie buildings, for the purpose of ascertaining what repairs may be needful; and. in the course of their, pretended.' examinations, they take an opportunity of stealing any little valuable article which may come hi their way. Some of the aged tenants of she benevolent retreats which these wretches have visited with this infamous design, have formerly occupied respectable stations in lite, and" probably retain a few reuc* of value. At the Alms-houses, near hhoreditch church, one poor old woman lost a watch, and another, three silver spoons. Similar depredations were commit ed in the Borough and elsewhere. It would be highly gratifying to see these surveyors standing at the bar of a court of justice. * .

EXHIBITION OF PAINTINGS ILLUSTRA-
TIVE OF SACRBD HISTORY.
A collection of paintings, under the above description, by old mastcrs, opens to the public this day at Exeter-hall, in the Strand. We were admitted to aview of this collection on Saturday; and found it a strange assemblage of the valuable and the wortbless-a few fine, though not of the highest class, some rare, and really curious, mixed up.with -many that have no pretensions to such good company. Among the first we noticed an excellent Cnrc .ion, in ivory, -by Benvenuto Cellini4 a pajnting by Steenwyck, of the Deliuery of St. Peter from Prisont m which, though the colouring is very inferior, the grouping is masterly, and the air of stillness anud repose.which should. pervade the subject weU preserved throughout, a painting of Samson and Dalilah, by Jan Steen, which possesses mainy exceRencies, but, not'ithstandiug its charm of colour and natural execution, is vitiated by the boorish forms and coarse expressions the natural emanations of that painter's pencil; and an aliegorical painting by Ghirlandio, the master- of Michael Angelo, conspicuous for the glow of its colour. and natural expression. A painting, stated in the catalogue. to be by Albano, is-hung in so ill a light, that it is impossible to pass an opimnoR as to its merits, because it cannot be seen, Of the rest it is unnecessary to say much.. The collection will doubtless warm .the devotion of the pious, ar in some respects gtatify the curidsity of the antiquary, but it possesses fevr attractions for the lovers of the really beautiful in art.

|EXHIBITIOaNof WA TER -COLOUR DRA WllGS.
The private view of this collection took place yesterday. It appears to be in a'l respects equal to those former exhibi^ tions wvith which the public have been regaled. The rooms were visited by a great number of persons ofraiik and fashion. The exhibiters are those whio have already made theniesdves well-known by the variety and excellence of their productions in tits deli.'htful branch of the art.
SIr. G. c. liobson has some admirable works, rhicb, for breadth of effect and power of painting, may endure a coimparison with some of the best pictures ofour most eminent landscape painters. They are so numerous that it wouild not be pracuicable to give any particular notice of many of theii; but two of them deserve exclusive mention. The first is 215, Lake Ccriskih, and the other 233, A Viewv from Westminsterbridge. The subject of eacl scene is wholly dissimilar fromt the other: but the effect is the same in both. That diffir ult point, tried by so many painters and achievcd by so few, Mr. Robson has hit writh great felicity. He represents that magical effect of the atmosphere when the day is not quite gone, and the tender nmoonlight is beginning to maix its cold rays with the dirn grey that pervades the scene. They are both very large pictures and serve to sustain the artist's iregu. tation at the higi rank e has reached.
Mlr. Copley Fielding has some works of various styles. Atn abundance of those small sketches and coast-scenes, which every body likes, and some of those bolder and more elevated productions which address themselves at once to the taste and understanding. No. 112. Iressels in a stiffbreeze offCalshot Castle,Harts,is one of thelatter, thewateris painted with uncommon spirit and accuracy of effect, and the shipping well composed, and the whole picture a most striking production. In 324, a coast-scene, he has introduced the gorgeous efiect of sunset with equal power.
No. 57. A Corn-field, Lincoln inthe distance, P. Dewint.- Tllis is a beauti(uil landscape-piece, and true to nature as car be conceived, and executed with a freedomn of hand w'hich is quite ad%nrable.
No. 63. A Gipsy Camp, bv the same artist is an excelI
lInt work, remarkable for the skill with whic the light is nmanaged. In another drawing of Wyninstary he is equally successful, although the effect is different.
Ir. Prout's smaller drawings are adrmirable. In the larger ones there is somewhat less of that precision anti force of touch for which his style is remarkable; but they are, nevertheless, very capital wvorks.
Ur. Barrett exhibits some of those ciassical colpositions in which lie excels. They are distinguished by the sanie richness of colour and boldness of drawing as his former produrtions; bitt they are, like themn, the same subjects repeated until they look like fac-similes of one another.
The drawings of Cox, G astineau, Varley, and many others are equal to those by whicis these artists have so worthily distinguished themselves on former occasions; but the great mumsber and variety of them preclude at this time any issore detailed notice of their merits.
In the historical line there is a picture by Aliss Louisa Sharpe, which is entitled to the first mention. The subject of it is taker. from that pleasant paper in the Spectator, in whichl the artifices of two rival beauties to outvie each other are described with such ininsitable whim. Mliss Sharpe hls cliosezi that point of time at which Brunetta, having been eclipsed by her former friend and present enemy Phillis, who has appeared in public in brocade more gorgeous and costly than had ever before beets seen in the eountry they inhabit, has effected her revenge. " Brannetta," says the Spectator "w was noiv prepared for the instlt, and came to a public b;all in a plain black silk mantua, attended by a beautiful negro girl, in a petticoat of the same brocade writh which Phillis was attired. This drew the attention of the whole coisspany, upon wihich the unhappy Phillis swooned away." The wihole spirit of the story las been seized and embodied by the artist with great success. The gronp. ing is highly inFgenious and effective - the draw ing extremely good and the colouring is at once harmonious and powerfuL. )'&e cannot help thin-ing this is stot only the best productiota of this artist, but that it manlifests a very decided im rovemen.
A1Lr Stephanofhas some excellent drawings. His scene representing the first meeting of Reniry VIII. and Anne Boleyn is very clefer. The subject is well made out, and the expression of the various faces remarkably good. It might have been as vell if he had made UWolsey more like the weUknown portraits of him. In trying to make him look handsome he has violated a verv familiar fact. He has some other drawings which are remarkable for the fancy and ingenuity he displays, and for that splendid power of colouring in wrhich he seems to delight.
No. 31. fsaac of York, Rebecca and Gurth, a very clever work by 1r. J. M. Wnght.-It represents the Jew's internal stuaggles between his gratitude and his love of monet, when Gurth is paying him the zecchins for his master. Thc subject is wel treated; but the execution is in some parts rather too flimsy.
No. 126. Jenny Jones before A[rs. Deborah WVilkins, is a better work by the same artist.
No. 39 and 52. Two Studics in the Barracks of the Second Reizmeng of Life Guards, F. Tayler.-Very spirted litte drawings.
No. 192. Hi htnd Ilospifality, J. F. Lewis.-A large work elaborately fnished, and in all respects, for composisition, cbaracter, and execution, worthy of great praise.
No. 247. InteriorC,,:.-nsition G. Cattermole.-A clever work, in which theoe is i good deai of fancy and no small power of hand.
No. 329. Shakspeare before Jtsctice Shallow; and No. 359, Kistg Jaenes I. and his Jeweller George Heriot, by A. Chisholns.-Both subjects are extremely well managed: the first is announced to be engraved for the publication of this society,-a distinction ofwhich it is quite worthy.
lMlr. Hunt has an abundance of drawings in that vigorous bold style which he-las made his own.
We are-compelLed bereto conclude our notice of this exii. bition with the general and well-deserved praise. that it is one ofthe most interesting and agreeable of all those collec. tionswhicharcsocrbditable to t5nglish art. A great ro. portion of the drawings were already marked as sol an we saw one of the attendants busily employed in adding the blue tickets, which indicated that they had found purchasers to' tusny others.
Amongst the persons preseut we noticed the Dukes Df Devonshire and St. Alban's the Duchess of St. Al, bin's, Marquises of Stafford, Ailesbury and Exeter Mar chioness of Stafford; Earls of Carlisle, hirowrlow, ant Lons. dale; Countesses Browritow, Cmrlisle, Essex, Morley, MXr. ton 'and Lonsdale; Lords Dudel Dover, Gcanthap, Qand Wfmarnclife; Ladie5 Dover, Grantham WVharneliffe, and Chetwynd; Sir.

The momtis of the National Gaitliy were yesterday crowded from morn till the close of' day, by all the leading architectural cozinoisseur8, amnatemtr, and professors In the metropolis to vicv the four design whose authors havebeen fortunate enough to have theirs sclected by tleeParliamentary Commissioners.
Although tle article vwhich appeired in tbis papere relative to this exhibition, last NVednesday, complained of limiting thearchitects of England to two styles, yet a' was by no means intended-to exclude those styles, nor to insinuate that-a design in sucha style might not-have been chosen; but rncrel
to coniplai of such a limitation, in which many of ouT§ ?- ng architects coincide, and tiM a reason why thc leadIng fikuxres of the dlesigns are muore eelesisstiesl than seratorial.
The dcsiafi td wlkieh the Commissiontrs have assigned the first prenilumn is that by Mar. Barry, and the drawings of th lch it Is comnposed- are displayed on a large screen in room N'o. I as ate also those by Mr. Buckler, to which the second pielnium is awar&dd, on a similar screen opposite. AIr. Hamilton's desigin, to which it awardesr the third premium, and Alr. Railton's, which is honoured by the fourth, are displayed back'to back on a similar screen in room No.-
Mr. Marry's is undoubtedlc"a splehdid design, gorgeous in decoration, tasteful in orxr genent and pomblnation, replete with good taste and sound kno6wledgq of outs best national style of arehitecture, and more palatial than we could have expected from the ecclesiasticxl style- reouired -by thr commnittees. As drawings they are artistiike, butu architecturally not more so than Mlr. Cockerell's, bat, like that gentleaan's, have all the appearance of autography about themn that many ot their compotitors want, whose drawings are evidently polygraphical in every respect, -the iebuiings cing by one hand, the skies by another, and the tigures by a third;
Melr. Barry preserves the beantifol cloistem the b elegant lietlc rhantry chapdl, and tEc- adjbinuing sbuildiings ; alo the ancient chapel of St. Stephen's, whbich he has converted into a hailt or ant-room for the Houses of Lords and Commons, wvhIch he has arranged oni either side. Theroom designedfor the Houseof Commons appears too small -to hold all the umlembers convensientty, wsicli, perhaps, is no fault on o,dinary occassons.
The front of W'estminster-halt is preserved as at present, but the other end is decorated with turrets, resembling those of the adjacent chapel of Henry V'll. The ancient hall of Rufus, as Richard ll.'s larger hal is often caUlet Is devoted as a vestibule' to the courts of-justice and the houses :of'Parliament, the latter of-which' is approached by a handeome fighbt of seeps, wbich leads to a species of portico wbich he calts St. Stephen's porch.
AMr Barry- also preserves many other o,f the useful portions of the existing buildings, which hie has delinseated in black, and hI additions in brown ink. At the corner, where 'tie Kinig's entrance is to be, he hias designed a lofty tower, rich and resplendcut in -ornament and statuary as the celebrated duomo of irilans. Indeed, the whole design is- so gorgeos and florid in ornatssstt, that it is evident, inr accomplishing his design, the architect had not the fear of estintates. or the cutters down of. estinatcs-betbre his eyes. So much haa this fault, if faulti i- rsay be'caied, prevailedt in fuuis designi, that I in the-architect's recent eattmintntiots-befo-e the select co

ErXIIBITION OYfi ALL THE DESIOGS OFFI:gRED FOR THI NEIV HOUSES OP PARLIA.ENT, NOW BXrFLBIRTIZAG IN THB NATIONAL GALL ErVY.
The last article in this paper concluded a brief but for the present sufficient notice of Ai r. Barry's desian, tl the public are in possession of that gentleman's denuded altered, and in fact newly-made design, now in hand, or cotmpleted by order of the committce for rebuilding the two houses of Parliament. MIr. Barry's evidence about his design, hisreasons foraltering it, seting it further back from-the river, intruding 150 feet h2rther into Abingdon-street, enlarging hiis courts,and various other alteration*, are in printfor the use of the committee, hut the public and the profession will not be satisfied till more candour and less mystery is observed.
The architects complain that the first premium is awarded to an avowed protega of one of the commissioners, and the second to an artist who not only avowed his name by the anagram or hieroglyphic of a buckle and the letter R, but is in a similar relation to another of the commissioners, and that the other two designs are also vastly inferior to manv of those which the commissioners scornfully rejected. They also complain that the drawings of Air. Barry's design, wvhichl we have before praised in contradistinction to those of Mur. Buckler, am So minute and elaborate, that the commissioners have more than once alluded to them in terms of praise, whilc they censure some of those which they have rejected, for the introd!uction of profuse and unnecessary omamene, m;erely to bcautify their designs, btut which would, if executed, be a wasteful expendliture of public money; justifying in the same breath the enriched appearance of the one, and censuring it in thte others.
M'ith regard to the circumstance of Mlr. Barry being permitted by the commissioners or committee to alter his design, there can be no real ground of complaint. On the contrary, had they insisted on his keeping his entire design for a combination of buildings that cover an area of more than scven acres of ground intuct and unaltered, they would truly have deserved censure; for if they have conscientiously awarded the p.alm of merit to this design, and MIr.Barry, its author,be an architect of sufficient knowledge and practice in his profession, as none who know Itim can doubt, then he ought to be installed at once 'E-,-v,; v, E-e ,-the superintendent of the works, as Sir Christoliher WVren was of those of8t. Pauls Cathedral. and the other churches and public buildings of the city after the great lire of London. This greatest of Ettglislt architects, in spite of the sneers of Sir Joh'h Soane, that he would rather be the designer of lr.igo Jou,s's watergate at the hottom ot Buckinghatn-street than all that WVren ever did, was so installed by Charles IT., and in every commission for those works was formally acknowledged, and gazrtted as a brother commissioner Nvith the great, the noble, anid the leained in the land, and not deKraOed to the level of aservant. In this authoritative eapacity he was appointed under the great seal, dated, according to his biographer, Elmes. wlto gives the whole commission and names of the commissioners, Novcmber 1°, 1673, as srchitect and o0w of the commissionesi for rebuilding the Cathedral of St. Paul. Tite letters patent were issued unto several lords, spiritual and :empora:, and other Persons of high rank and quality, and to Christopiter Wren, Doctor of Lavs,Surveyor-Gcneral of the Royal Wjrorks, &c. This commission and letters patent would formn a good precedent for a similar commnission for re-building the Houses of Parliament.
This great architect was not only permitted to alter his design, butdidsofromtinie to time, as the worksarose, and his knowledge improved and it is curious to observe the pro. gress of alteration in this great man's mind and design, as enumerated in hkIr. Elmes's work, taken from the autograph cesizns of the architect preserved in the second volume of Sir Christopher lVren's deigns in the library of All Souls' Col. lege. Oxford. The King and his Government allowed and autlhorized the architect to mnake such variations and alterations in his design as he pleased, and most properly, as his hiographer observes, left the whole to his managemestt, a- far as the design went: hence the homogenieal style of this tunique and complete building; snch should be the constitution and conduLct of the commission for rebuilding the housce of Parliament, and if the selection of the architect be unobjectionable, trifling alterationis of detais and arrangemcnt ought to be per.mit ted.
Of the design which obtained thethird premium, itis difficult to conceive by what powers of ratiocination it can have been so honoured in the face of all the other surrounding designs. If Mr. Cockerell's beautiful design was degraded to a lowergrade than this, as bcing neither Elizabethan nor Gothic,what in the name of all fineart isthe style of this? If thi. design, and that wMhichl obtained the fourth premium, be so immeasurably above all those which are rejected, that the commissioners, who were desired to select not less than three nor more than five designs for them to honour in the face of the Btitish nation, could not find a fifth amonz the 80 other designs, wvliv let us, as Henry VIIL did, senI to Italy for architects to supply our own deficiency. But we are not so defective in architectural talent as these commissioners have declared,by reporting that they could not find a fifth worthy even to be placed below the two which are hung back to back in the second room of the National. Gallery, as if saying to them in proof of the greatness they have tlhus thrust upon them, si conforanotionern requiris, cireumspice.
It is well, however, that all the sueccssful, and most of the unsuccessful, designs are now before the public in this exhibition, together with those of Sir Johnt Snane, now exhibiting in the Royal Academy, designed in 1794 and 1796, and one made in Rome by the same architect in 1779, and those bv Mr. Gandy exhibited at tile Royal Academy in 1833 and 1135, a portion or which is also in the same exhibition and the designs published bythe House of Commons in 1833 miade by Sir John Soane, Sir-Jeffry Wvattville. and Mlesss. Benjamin Wvystt, Savage, the lae WVilliam Kent, Deering, [,ee, Blore, the Right Hon. J. W. Croker, Goodwin. Rigby Wason, MI.P., Decimus Burton, Allen, and Hanbury Tracey, Esq., AY.P., are all at once before the tribunal of public justice. The public in general are unsophisticated judges, and have always done justice, particularly in the fine arts, as history proves, from the timeof their just adiudication bltween Phidies and Alcamenes, as to their rivalstatues of Minerva for the Acrepolis, to the reversal of the decision of a late Pcpe who invited a competition of designs for the Piazza lel Popolo, in which our countryman, Harrison of Chester, embarkedi, and the judges selected Roman designs; but against which decision the eclebrated Piranesi protested * the public were admitted, and Harrison received the justly deserved prize.
Thepublicaremostly julst judges; Aristotle admits that the multitude are the surent judge of the productions of the arts, and Cicero says,that although the people may sometimes
dmircean inferior work, yet when it is placed beside a fitstare performance, they will not hesitate in giving a correct decision.

THEl BXHBITIION OF PICTUABPS AT T.IrB
LOUYVRE.
(PtOM A COBBBSPONDEipT.)
PAY-IS, MoNDAY. , I have just left the annual exhibition of pictures by living artists, wvhich opened this morning in the gallery of the Louvre, aud sit down to givTe you my first impressions of it, fresh as received. As usual upon this oventful day, the most important in the year to the numerous tribe of paintera abiding in Paris, the Place du Museum was crowded from a very early hour with artists and their friends. At 11 o'clock the doors opened, the gaUeries were filled in an instant, and continued so the whole day. It is amusing enough to see the eagerness of the artirts, many of whom, either not choosing to expend a franc on a catalogue, or too impatient to wfait their turn to obtain one froi the vendor, rush up and donm the galleries in a. state of frantic excitement, seeking the precious bit of canvas, which they will not be. lieve the jury bas beesa so injudicious as to reject. For a long time perhaps the search is in vain; at last the invaluable specimen of art flashes upon the delighted Apelles, cheering his eyes and heart, or else a peep at a friend's catalogue convinces him that he is not amongst the chosen. If curses were cannon balls, the committee would this day, Within a few minutes afterll, have found themselve3 particularly well pulverized, expese&as they were to the anathemas not only of the rejected but of the misplaced; of those whose picturel are hung too high or too low, in too strong a light or too feeble a one. Whether rejections have been less numerous, or the pictures submitted more so this year than last, I can. not say, but a greater number havo found favour in the eyes of the jury. To say nothing of sculpture, engramings, archi. tectural models, &c., upwards of 2,009 pictures, the pro. duction9 of some 1,200 artists, have been alh,wed places in tho Louvre.
To commence at the top of the tree, the point to which public attention is first directed:-AryScheffer, who maybe considerad thelcaderefthepresentFrenchschool,andwhofor the last year or two, in common with Ingres, P. Delaroche, and other eminent artists, has sent nothing to the exhibition,
now makes up for bis previous absonce by the contribution| of seven pictures-three religious subjects, three taken from Goethe, and a portrait. Of these pictures it may be said that all have considerable merit and showthe hand ofa s3killed artist, bu: that all have also important defects. Tie drawing is excellent,. but there is a want of roundn'ss in the figures,-an angularity arising partly perhaps from the imitation of the German school, at which Scheffer and his followers aim, but in which they are not always successful. uis colouring is decidedly bad-chalky and without depthand the general impression conveyed to me by his pictures is a want of vigour, lishbest this year iuWJ'Enfant 0haritable," a subject drawn from Goetz von Terlichingen. To Henry Seleffer it is impossible to give even the qualified praise bestowed upon his far more giftea brother. His heads of Christ are most unpleasing, not to say offensive; heavy, expressionless, and badly conceived. One is led to believe that he has taken for his model some bearded, leaden-visaged lounger from the Boulevard des Italiens; assuredly he has not sought his inspiration where best it might be found-in a careful study and contemplationof the old masters.
Of the square room preceding the long gallery, and where a majority of the larger and more remarkable pictures usually fin I place, nearly the wyhole of one side is occupied by an enormous and really fine picturo by Horace Vernetthe " Battle of Isly," painted for tho Versailles Gallery. Itis the moment -when Colonel Jousaouf presents to General Bugeaud the Moorish st-andards, and the Binperor of Mo. rocco's famous parasol, which ho and his Spahis hare cap.

tured. The Marshal himself is nearly in the centre of the Iuicture; in the distance, oi aU sides, are seen the Moors in ,ll retreat, followed up by the French Light Cavalry and Infantry skirmishers, Wounded men and officers, the tents -of the Moors, carts and horsemen, are in the foreground. A vwhite horse, mounted by an Arab dressed entirely in 'w7hite, might, I think, haye been dispensed with. It makes 5Ti unpleasant glaring patch in the most conspicuous part -of the foreground. The whole effect, however, is good, .-bold and spirited,-and the picture does Vernet credit. There is an unusual paucity of battle-pieces in this year's exhibition, whether it be that the public are getting tired of that style, or that artists find it difficult to hit upon fresh subjects. There are a few African razzias and skirmishes, one representing the death of a Captain Gereaux, who, being, as the catalogue informs us, thrice surmmoned by Abdel-Kader himself to surrender, replied, in emulation of U:l,lypnne's -celebrated answer at lRaterloo, "Les 2RranfCais meureiit et ne se sendent pas." (Cambronne, by-the. by, it has recently been affirmed by a French writer, never said anything of the kind; his answer being a single word, redolent of the barrack-yard, and less decent than energetic.) Africa has also supplied Philippoteaux -with subjects for three agreeable pictures; the late Duke of Orleans restoring their lihberty to two Arab prisoners, "Moorish women in their apartment;" and "A Street in Algiers ;" the latter full of character, and of lazy Oriental faraiente.
Above the entrance to the square room, in tbe same place occupied three or four years ago by Winterhalter's very agreeable portrait of the Queen of the French, is an equally ,auccessful one of Louis Philippe, by the same artist. The recent exchange of visits botween the Sovereigns of France sad England has supplied various painters with subjects, and it is to be wished theyhad handled them better. Win. terhalter's " Saloon at Windsor Castle," Queen Victoria presenting her children to Louis Philippe, is a failure; the children the only good part of it. Eugene Lami has been still less felicitous in his representation of a family party at the Castle of Eu; Louis Philippe and Prince Albert otn the sof; the Queen of the French and a little red-faced lady, intended for Queen Victoria, but not in the smallest degree resemblinig her, seated near each other at a table. Morel Fatio's only picture in this exhibition, " the King of the French leaving Treport irL a barge to go on board the Royal yacht, 'Victoria and Albert,"' is by no means in his happiest mtanner.
There are remarkably few landscapes this year; rather an advantage, when one remembers the vast n-amber of daubs of this description that usually encumber the walls of* the gaUery. Of the few that there are, but few are good; the remainder consisting of those masses of green styled by the French plates of spilach, more lke signs for a greengrocer's shop than specimens of art. Portraits, on the other hand, always a staple commodity, abound, and there is a fair proportion of good oues. Groselaude exhibits tw7o ladies, whose sweet countenances would pass off far worse paintings. Guignet, Perignon, and Heuss have several excellent portraits; one of M. Guizot by the last-named painter is a remarkably good likeness of that statesman. Lepaulle has made the most of the dull countenance of a Spanish grandee, the present Duke of Osuna. There are a few good miniatures, showing progress in this line of art. Whose by J. Gaye, on the right hand in the ante-chamber, are amongst the best, and are admirable for their careful finish. As usual, Madamo de Mirbel and her pupils muster in great force, and have the best places assigned to them.
Alfred Dedreux, the Prenich Landseer, although at a vast distance from his English contemporary, has some very good pictures, the best of them beink " a Hunting Party in the reign of Louis XV." This artist displays great skill in the distribution of his lights anud the general arrangement of his pictures; but his horses would be far better if their attitudes were less forced, and if he would allovw some of them to stand still, instead of twisting themselves about and vislently pawing, as if tormented by flies. He has a spirited group of dogs in the picture above referred to, although it seems miraculous that the piqueur vwho holds them should be able to resist the violent tugging of so many large and powerful hounds. Anywhere but in a picture he would assuredly be drageed forward, instead of holding them in, as M. Dedreux enables him to do, with perfect ease and comfort to himself. A little bit of tenderness, a lady amorously leaning upoll the shoulder of her attendant cavalier, might also have been spared, as hardly likely to be enacted, even iu the facile days of the lath Louis, in the midst of an assemblage. of grooms and huntsmen. But these trifling defects and affectations M. Dedreux vill doubtless learn to qorrect. Of other animal painters, Janet Lange may be named, although very inferior indeed to DedreuxAlady of the pleasant name of Rosa Bonheur has a very fair grotp of sheep reposing ; and Verboeckhoven, a Belgian artist, has a capital dog picture, the very best thing of the kind thatI saw in the exhibition. Be it observed, npa9ssant, thatlast year some of the best pictures were contributed by foreign artists, and this year Belgians, EDnglish, and a Spaniard cut a most respectable figure at the Louvre. A " Vierge Consolatrice," by Madamo Fanny Geefs, of Brussels, is a charming picture. Senor Villa Amil, who sent soime capital Spanish scenes to former exhibitions, has only one picture in the present year's show, but that one very good, " the Salon de los Embajadores, in the Madrid Palace." W. Jackson's "Fete sous Louis XV.," isWatteauishandagree able, although a little outnf. There is a view of the " Port of Ancona," by Stanfield ; but in the crowd and hurry of a fist visit I missed seeing it.
Amongst the marine painters, Grudin has sent ao less than 13 pictures, but unfortunately the quality by no means keeps pace with the quantity. This artist has, of late, greatly fallen off. The " Scene on the coast of Scotland," seafowl on a rock, &c., is perhaps one of the most respectable of his this year's productions. His sea-fights are very so-so. A MIr. Mayer contributes an episode of French naval history, interesting, if true; an English 50-gun ship boarded and t9ken by a French privateer, carrying 32 8-pounders. Another painter, nearly of the samO name, Meyer, has a good rescue of a shipwrecked lady by a Newfoundland dog; the water admirably transparent. Biard, whose pictures are generally favourites, has the "Right of Search," a slaver boarded by a French vessel, and the slaves set at liberty. His other picture, a shipwirecked group upon a raft attacked by a shark, drew a crowd of gazers. It is very spirited, although the shark appeared to me more like a vwhale.
There is, of course, a sprinkling of absurities in the exhibition, but reatUy only a sprinkling. A " Romeo and Juliet," engaged in what is meant for a parting embrace, but which looks more like the commencement of a wrestling match; a " Moonlight Scene," by hM. Auguste Rdgnier, as blue as if it had been dipped in a dyer's vat; a " Daniel in the Lions' Den," the prophet surrounded by a whole menagery of fero. ciou'lbeasts, over whose heads a detachment of angels are -floeting, waving their arms and apParently mesmerizing the animals into submission. There is "L'Enfcr," by one Chenavard, who must surely have dreamed it after a heavy supper, or he couldahardly have devised so disgusting a set of horrors. Tho " Murder of Queen Galswinthe by a slave, by order and before the eyes of her husband chilperic," is ano jl,"5pleasaiit subject, and unpleasantly treated.
Thelis Rafine gorgeGus " Spauish Bull-fight," by Porion, taken from a description by Theophile Gautier in his Tica los Miron*cs; horses and toreros roiling on the ground in a cloud of dust; chulos waving their crimson cloaks; galleries ftUl of pretty women and eager spectators; and the bright sky of Seville above all. A Florentine "Primavera," by MUller, is also much admired. The lady in the foreground, with llac in her hair, is a most lovely creature. The physiognomy of a negro with a tropical bira upon his wrist, keeping off the playfull attack of an Italian greyhound, has
character, and makes an excellent contrast-with the fair and beautiful countenance of the woman.
It is rather difficult to say what is the distinguishing feature of this year's exhibition. A great deal was expected, and I think it not improbable that the general feeling may be one of disappointment, from the 'absence of anAivin very striking, although there are many pretty pictures, some good ones, and but a moderate number of ultra-bad. A great deal of ingenuity is displayed in
some of the tc&eaux de 9e21-e, and those generally take well with the Parisian public, who love to see an idea smartly renderedby a picture, particularly if it be comic.
Of the merits of the exhibition as a whole I wi not give an opinion, for it requires more than a six hours' ramble amongst the maze of canvass to be able to do so with cor-
rectness. I am inclinod to thik, however, that the exposition of 1846 will prove at leastofavieage.merit.

ART- UNION EXHIBITION.
An alteration has been madewith regard to the exhibition of this year, which endows it with more than usual interest. Formeriy the only pictures shown were those selected by the prizeholders from the coUections exhibited during the current year, snd hence the generblity of visitore merely saw works which they bad already seen a few weeks before By a new regulation the pictures chosen by tho prizeholders of former year e alo Admitted to the gallery on this occasion, snd henoe a greater number of oomparatirel inaortant works is obtained, while many impressione w 'ch hd faded from the memory are revived.
The collecion of pictures exhibited by the Art-Union cannot from the very-nature of the society, be taken as an. index of the state of Britieh art, Though there ae prizes as high as 200., by far the grtater number are for small amounts and hence there isbutalimited command over thote works which constitLte the chief ornament of our g^arie.: A picked mediocrity-if we may use the term-is the usu%l character of the gallery, and nams which are content to' hold the eecond rank elsewhere are brought into prominence here. A galaxy of talent must not be expected but, neverthele., the superiority of the collection this yea shows tbatAhaxprinciple of enlarging the field of selection has worked well, and the visitor will find somethng more than the mere record that such and such picturoe have been. selected by such and such lucky indi viduash.Th "Dawn of Morning," and the "Mountain Chief's Funeral, " taken from the yeaLs 1846 and 1849, are good pecimens of the artist, Mr. FP Danby, both in his soberest and most eccentric moaents. Mr. Gilbert ba1, probably, never exceeded the "Death of OCarinal Beaufort," which belongs to 1849. The young lady, by Mr. Hart, called a Sibyl but looking lik a. Magdalen, is one of. the chstest productions of thatartist. The "Windingg of a River," by Mr. Crewick, and "1Repose" (a cattle piece), by' Mr. T. 8. Cooper, are a typical as can be of the arst
manner and oice of subjects, and the humour and finish of Mr. Ftith, with his tendency to caricature, are well set .forth in the "1Scene from the VW"a Of WLkefield." Mr. E. M.

The water- colour department, though it compriee names of the fint eminence Ior a prise will go furthe in water thin in oil), is leso interesting than initbe expected.

EXHIBITION OF ENGLISH ARTISTS.
The plan of opening an extra exhibition in which tbe aUtists of Great Britain, having the jurisdiction 6f particular societies, may come on their own autlbority before the public, seems to have succeeeded. Last year the gallery of the old Water Colour o *iety "was opened for a collection of sketches and drawings by Engribh artists, as a novel experiment, ax.d thi year the experiment is repeated. The chief feature of the gallery is the new aspect under which some of the best modern painters are presented. The. water-colour men are, indeed, much in the same position as when they paint for their own soQieties, but many of the painters of large works in. oil come forward here, covAtiDg a smaller surfaceh Than when they paint for the Academy or tbe British lnstitution, and giving their conceptions fresh from 'he brain without undergoing the toil of elaboration. IThe best artists of the day exhibit in great numbers, but the class that is most brought forward is the historical and epic. Landseape painteis and students of dramatic life are alm ays to be found in cabinet dimenuione, but there is a novel interest in catching the first notion of an historical artist.

TALKING OF BOOKS
I
HYMNS
AS POETRY
By Oliver Edwards
It has long struck me as strange that the anthologists of English poetry have shown so very little appreciation of the literary merits of many of the English hymns. The Golden Treasury contains not one, and The Oxford Book of English Verse but a very few. Those which Q admitted were an early sixteenthcentury example, Henry Vaughan's " My Soul there is a Country," and Addison's " The Spacious Firmament on High." One might have thought that, after so nobly, with that last poem, ushering in the great era of English hymn-writing-let us call it that from Addison to Newmanthe anthologist would have been emboldened to give some other examples. But no. There is not another hymn (in the generally accepted sense of the word) in his selection of what was finest among the shorter English poems.
Can it be that the English have so much the habit of keeping their various types of thought and feeling in separate compartments of their minds that they cannot think of hymns as literature ? Or is it a form of Puritanism which refuses to see aesthetic qualities in an essentially religious exercise of words? If this latter be true the Puritanism is one not shared by our neighbours the Welsh, for when the late W. J. Gruffydd in 1931 compiled his Welsh anthology he drew more numerously upon William Williams Pantycelyn, the greatest of the Welsh eighteenth-century hymn-writers, than upon any other poet except Ceiriogand one of the latter's contributions, even, was a hymn. Yet the best English hymn-writers were by any unbiased standards poets of very notable rank.
The hymn, as a literary form, has one special claim upon the esteem of anyone who has been a professional writer. In the hymn the writer must express himself With sincerity of feeling, vividness of phrase, and eloquence, within a comparatively limited choice of metres, and within a range of subject-matter and thought dictated to him by the tenets of his faith. There ale, let it be admitted, a vast number of hymns in which this searching test has been too much for the poet's skill. And there are a good many cases, too, in which words and tune form so much a single unit in the mind that it is hardly possible to disentangle the strictly literary element. I remember that the singing in school chapel of " I praised the earth in beauty seen," with the moving final lines of its first stanza, "And earth and ocean seemed to say, Our beauties are but for a day," brought to the adolescent mind a sudden sharp realization of this world's transitory nature-a lasting emotional and aesthetic (though not I think religious) experience. Yet how much of that effect was due to Heber's words, and how much to the noble air by John Hullah to which we sang them, I cannot now attempt to determine.
For all that, however, there are Many hymns about whose merits as poetry there can be no doubt at all-especially among those of the eighteenth century.
There was a precision, combined sometimes with orotundity, in the poetic diction of that time which served the hymn-writer admirably, and which he could use with complete sincerity-as could be instanced again and again from Charles Wesley, and perhaps above all from Isaac Watts. How can any anthology of English poetry be adequate which does not contain the poem that has probably moved more English people more deeply than any other? "Our God, our help in ages past" (which is how Watts began his poem) is full of the most vivid and exquisitely phrased images. And in Watts, too, are some of those overwhelming anthropomorphic visions which were characteristic of his century:-
My God, who mak'st the sun to know
His proper hour to rise,
And to give light to all below,
Dost send him round the skies.
There is, implicit in that stanza, a vivid way of seeing things which one finds again, half a century or more later, in the most beautifully worded of Cowper's hymns:-
God moves in a mysterious way,
His wonders to perform:
He plants His footsteps in the sea,
And rides upon the storm.
Try mentally to materialize those two stanzas, and is the result not something very close in kind to the visions which William Blake expressed in watercolour ?
Nor are these isolated, or especially rare, instances. The eighteenth century supplies many other hymns which may be read with aesthetic enjoyment; and in one of these, Toplady's " Rock of Ages," there is an impassioned mystic self-abasement, almost a self-torture, very different from the common placid standard of religious feeling anid expression in England:-
Nothing in my hand I bring; Simply to Thy Cross I cling;
Naked, come to Thee for dress;
Helpless, look to Thee for Grace; Foul, I to the fountain fly;
Wash me, Saviour! or I die.
How can the anthologist - unless blinded by some irrelevant consideration -have failed to appreciate the qualities of such poetry ? It is too much to believe him so inhuman that he can have read, without trembling on the verge of tears, H. F. Lyte's sonorous, melancholy, and yet uplifting valediction:
Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day; Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away; Change and decay in all around I see;
0 thou who changest not, abide with me.
Rather one imagines that some stubborn, half- unconscious resistance, based on the feeling that poetry ought, at least in itssimplerforms, to beabletomake its effects without calling in aid all the spiritual suggestion which lies within the religious and devotional themej that it should bea "pure" art, has as a rule inhibited him from giving way to his own instinctive feeling. If so, it is time that he should recant, perhaps taking the very words of his recantation from another great and beautiful hymn:
"Pride ruled my will: remember not
p-ast years."

Autobiography is an area in which writers tend to be self-centred . Alan Ross is the exception to the rule, writes Chris Peachment A lan Ross wants his two volumes of autobio - graphy , Blindfold Games and Coastwise Lights (the latter pub - lished this week) to be seen as the raw material from which he began to write poetry, and only incident - ally autobiographical. He is being unduly modest, because they are more than the prosaic pretext for the poems which stud the books. This second volume is also in part a fascinating history of metropolitan literary life from the end of the war, when Ross was demobbed from the navy (Able Seaman, Russian Con - voys ), through the Soho and Fitzrovia set of the late Forties, past the more recherche figures of
the Fifties, such as Julian Mac - laren - Ross and Henry Green, and up to the Sixties, when he edited the London Magazine. It is also a collection of character sketches of people he has known; he writes most tenderly about painters such as John Minton and Keith Vaughan. So where, to echo Roy Campbell, is the bloody horse? The answer to that is: in every single well-chosen word. Ross might not be elbowing his way to the foreground as is the practice in much modern autobiography, but nevertheless a picture emerges of a perceptive man, with a rare liking for his fellow men, a strong interest in cricket and horses, and a fine prose style. One wonders why he had not been a novelist.
"I did try once," he says, "but without much conviction. It al - ways seems extraordinary to me how, out of all the multifarious things that happens to you, a no v - elist can settle on one subject and turn it into a book. The war was tremendous for someone like me; it gave you a subject gift-wrapped ."
His shipboard adventures, in - cluding being sealed alone in the forward magazine of a sinking ship with a hose pipe to play on the glowing metal, are expertly told in the first volume, Blindfold Games. But while at sea, "all I wanted to do when I got ashore again was to head for Soho. The grand life, that others.dreamed of, never appealed." He maintains that Soho was at its greatest just before the end of the war, after which most of the people went off to find jobs, leav - ing only the most fuddled of hangers-on still cadging drinks at the bar. Julian Maclaren-Ross , who was the model for the exper - imental novelist X. Trapnel in Anthony Powell's Dance to the Music of Time sequence, was an enemy of promise. "He should have been tremendously success - ful . He was very gifted. He had an enormous memory for the di - alogue of all the films he had seen, and would have made a good scriptwriter. But everything in
him was failure. He would take 10 advances from different publish - ers , and therefore be unable to publish with any of them, because the other nine would be wanting their money back. His fur coat and his cane, all that/o//e de grandeur would have been fine if he had found someone to look after him, and give him a sense of worth." R oss was more fond of Henry Green, whose strange gerund-titled novels {Living, Loving, Doting , Ending ) go in and out of fashion. "His father ran a small industrial firm, and for most of his life Henry made fun of him shuffling about the office moving a piece of paper from desk to desk. But then when Henry inherited the firm, he just couldn't make a go of it, and drank himself to death in no time. He had been such a handsome, dandyish man, but by the end he looked like a tramp. It was very sad." Ross had long been friendly with painters and illustrators, and
the sale of some carefully bought works of art enabled him to buy a race horse. "In 20 years, I won about 30 races so it just about paid its way and was great fun. It cost about £5,000 a year to stable and train a horse, so if you win a couple of races then it will pay its way. Nowadays though, there are very few small British owners left. It's .the sort of hobby that was possible then, but no longer." His other great passion was cricket, and if a man could write that England never lost a Test series throughout his career as the Observer 's cricket correspondent then he can justly boast of having lived through a Golden Age. Nowadays, he devotes himself solely to editing the London Magazine, which he does single - handed from a shed in the back garden in South Kensington. It has an enviable record of introducing new writers to the public, and he can claim William Boyd and Graham Swift, among others, as
recent proteges
The life of small magazines, how - ever , does not become easier with the passing of time : "The Arts Council has been very generous in the past, but 1 suspect that every - thing soon will have to be self - sup - porting . When I began in 1960 a phone call to Chatto or Faber or OUP would guarantee an advert - isement being placed simply be - cause they thought it was a respon - sible thing to do. Nowadays, some accountant bleats something about "cost-effectiveness" and so they don't do it. Now people are talking about sponsorship, but sponsors always want a box at the theatre or a seat at Lords. Not much mileage in a literary magazine." It is iniquitous that one has to keep reminding people, in these Thatcherite times, that there are some activities which should never be judged by the size of their wallet. "Oh there are lots of things," says Ross, "that really ought to lose money." Coastwise Lights by Alan Ross, pub - lished this week by Collins (£11.95)

SALOMONS CONCERT.
Mr. Salomon held his first Subscription Concert on Monday night, which was a most exquisite treat to the Amateurs of real fine Music. The Vocal Selection consisted of two" Songs by Viganoni, two by Braham, and two by Mara, with a Duetto’ by her and Viganoni, in which these eminent Singers outvied each,other "by their different excellencies. The Instrumental part consisted of two grand Symphonies, composed by Haydn, which were performed in a stile that enraptured, the Audience. The two Messrs. Morals, lately arrived from Bavaria, played a Concertante for two violins, with a brilliancy and neatness of execution, seldom equalled; anti a Mr. Himmel, Mailer of the Chapel to the King of Pruffia, who also lately came to this Country, treated the Audience with a Sestetto, in the composition os which he not only displayed science, blended with taste and feeling, but also the most uncommon powers of execution and effect on the piano forte.
The Company was highly respectable. His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge, besides several of the fit st Nobility ami Gentry being present; but it was,not st. numerous as the entertainment deserved, owing partly, as we understand, to the Private Theatricals in Tottenbamcourt-road, having been postponed from the preceding Monday, and happening consequently t<> chilli with Mr. Salomon’s first night. It is to be hoped, however, that the real taste and liberality of those who have the means of encouraging such elegant entertainments, will be sufficient amply to repay the Conductor of them for his trouble and expences.

AlbitEtsR CONCERT.
The second Subscription. Confcert Supper and Ball took place last Monday evening, at the New Rooms, Hanover-square. Though the Concert commenced about eight o’clock, the Room was not completely filled till it was nearly ten, at which hour his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales graced the assembly with his presence, but retired soon after the Concert was concluded. The Orchestra, as on the former occasion, was partly composed of amateurs, and partly of professional performers. The principal instrumental' performers of the latter description were Miss Castelo, who played the harp; Mr. Holmes, the bassoon'; aud Master Morri, the violin: the singers were, Mrs, Bianchi, Mess. Gore, Evans, Nield, Vaughan, Masters Kellner, Guttler, &c. The Concerto-violin, by Master Morri, a little boy, between seven and eight years of age, called forth the approbation and astonishment of every person present. A song, beautifully composed by the Honourable J. Spencer, was sung by Master Kellner. The selection of music for this occasion consisted of favourite pieces from the works of Handel, Dussek, Yanovick, Haydx, Harrison, &c. the whole of which were most favourably received by the company. The Concert ended between eleven and twelve, when the company retired to partake of an elegant supper prepared for them in the apartment below ; which not being large enough to contain above one half of the Subscribers, the glees were performed in the Concert Room. After five or six glees by the singers above named, and ably accompanied on the harpsichord by Mr. Spencer, the ball commenced in the same room, which had been cleared for the purpose. From the attention and exertions of Mr. Second, dancing-master, as Master of the Ceremonies, the greatest regularity prevailed amongst the dancers, whom we left at this amusement.—Besides his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, we perceived the following Nobility and Gentry amongst the company:—
D«cAi*.qes-yDevoiishire, Marlborough, Bolton, and Leeds.
Countesses—Dartmouth, Buckinghamshire, Kenmare, Stanhope, Westmeath, and Carhampton.
The Margravine of Anspach.
Ladies—Melbourne, Melville, Heathcote, Elizabeth Monk, Percival, Jane James.

The Concert at the Mansion-house last night was crowded beyond all precedent. The Egyptian-hall, beautifully illuminated with gas-light, was filled long before the commencement of the performance, and at eight o’clock not a single seat was to be procured tor the numerous and elegantly dressed women who continued to arrive in successive parties for a considerable time afterwards. 'The performances were of a very high order, and afforded a combination of vocal and instrumental harmony seldom surpassed in the estimation of the musical world. We have not time to particularise individual merits : it gives us pleasure, however, to testify to the arduous and successful exertions of all those eminent performers who so handsomely rendered their services on this occasion. The offer was the more liberal, inasmuch as the object was one which could only interest those who feel an anxious desire for improving the situation of the lower orders, and had no connexion with any subject of a political or national character. Our readers are probably aware, that the profits of the exhibition are intended to be’applied to the purpose of extricating the Royal Institution for the Education of Poor children from its present pecuniary embarrassments.

CONCERT AT THE EGYPTIAN HAZE-
. A.eoncert was held yesterday eveningat the Egyptian-hall, in? the Mansion-house, under the patronage of her most gratiousSlajesty Queen ^Caroline, for the benevolent purpose ot relieving from an oppressive debt the. Soya! Institution for the - education,, on the British system, of 1,000 boys and SOfrgtrls, of all religious denominations, in two capacious schools situate in North-street, City-road. It had been well known'for many days before this concert took place,that her Majqsty. intended to honour it with her presence; and, in consequence, no inconsiderable crowd was last night arectribled to greet her coming with their'unbought acclamations. From 5 o’dockm the afternoon ttllft o’clock in the evening die anxiety Of tho people to receive her Majesty with that affectionate loyalty sehttit they always seel towards her was apparent in all quarters, but mpst-particularly in Cheapside and the adjacent streets/rhere can be Ijftle doubt in the minds of thoro who paid attention to the discourse Of the multitude which was yesterday evening collected in that part Ot-the town, font, if her Majesty had been desirous of,enjoyuig another popular triumph, she might then have enjoyed it to the very summit of her wish, as every mouth was filled with praise of her undaunted courage, and her kind and generous behaviour to all who have the happiness of being in any way connected with her. But her Majesty, who seeks not popularity by her conduct, but who, on the contrary, is sought for by it, disappointed the expectations of her many friends and admirers, and instead of ostentatiously attempting to catch their applause, modestly withdrew from it by directing her course to the Mansion-house through the by streets of the metropolis instead of through its great and public thoroughfares, foured it would have been almost impossible for her to have reaches the Mansion-house by the way of Cheapsidcr without creating trie very greatest contusion in it, as its whole line from Si. Paul s church-yard tn. the Mansion-house was filled from half past five o clock till seven with an unbroken chain of carriages. The doors of the EgrotnmTidll were opened to the numerous comers by six o clock, and before many minutes had elapsed from the opening, the hall was crowded to repletion. Her Majesty, though she left Brandenburgh-house at half past five, did not enter the haU till nearly seven. She arrived, however, at the Mansion-house about half past six oclock, having tome over Southwark bridge to escape the salutations ofthe people. Lord and Lady Hood, and Lady Ann Hamilton, were tn_the same carriage with her Majesty. The Hon. K. Craven, Mr. Wuzon, and Aiderman Wood, followed in a second carriage, and fllr. Hobhouse and Sir R. Wilson in a third. Her Majesty was received at the door of the Mansion-house by the gentlemen of the committee who managed the procession to St. Paul’s. Mr. Faveil, Ilir. Hurcombe, Mr. George Stevenson, Mr- Carter, and Mr. Wright, preceded her Majesty to the stairs, where she was met by the Lord Mayor, who ushered her into Wilkes’s parlour, where the school committee of ladies were in attendance. Her Majesty partook of some refreshments there before she made her appearance in the halL We need not say that,when she entered it, the cheering by which she was received was most loud and enthusiastic. Nor can it, upon this Occasion, be said that it proceeded only from the lowest orders of society ; for among the company present, we noticed the Dukeor Leinster, Lord Milton, M.P., Sir Ronald Fergusson, M.P., Sir W. de Crespigny, H.P., Sir G. Noel, RI.P., Sir J. Aubrey, M.B., imd family, Mr.Whitbread, M.P., Mr.Byng,M.P., Mr.Western, M.P., JMr. Honywood, M.F. and family; Mr. Crecvey. M.P.; Mr. senziyson. M.P. and his lady; Mr. Scudamore, M.P.; Mr. Hume, M.P.; Mr. Martin, M.P. and family; Mr. Sykes, M.P. and his lady; Mr. Crompton, M.P.; Mr. P. Moore, M.P.; Mr. Palmer, M.P.; Mr.Monck,M.P.; Mr. Gordon, M.P. and his lady ; Mr. Wm. Williams, M.P. and his family; Mr. Denman, M.P• and his fiunily; Mr. Pares, M.P. Mr. H. Thomson, and several other gentlemen of fortune and respectability. The cheering did not cease until some minutes after the committee had conducted her Majesty to the handsome seat which had been prepared for her on 2 raised platform under a spacious canopy. As soon as st had ceased, the concert began. It opened with Beethoven s ^iand sinfonrs, which was admirably executed: Quel oc/wet/o, i>y Camporesi and Ambrogetti. was delicious; and Neates iantafiia, pianoforte, excited very general attention. In the second part the scena Echo a te, by Camporesi, was most warmly and deservedly encored, The Chough and Crow was well given by Miss Goodall, Terrail, and Bellamy; and her Majesty was particularly attentive to Ambroeetti and Angrisani’s Do ra mi* Miss Stephens was promised in tne Echo Song, but did not appear, to the great disappointment of every person present, though her absence was by no means satisfactorily accounted for. The concert should have concluded with the well known overture to the Zauberflote; but, in •compliment to her 4 Majesty, Rule Britannia’ was loudly called for, and terminated the entertainment. Her Majesty, who had been ■conversing with great affability with Mr. Hobhouse ami Sir R- Wil•son, was then led out of the hall with the same formalities as were -used at her entrance, and amid the same exuberance of cheering and
applause.
We cannot conclude our account of this concert without congratulating rhe friends of the excellent charity which it was intended to /support on the success which attended their efforts on the present occasion* The scats in the centre of the Hall are calculated to accommodate 18C0 persona : they were completely filled, as were also the .'benches az id niches placed on the aides of it. Indeed so full was every particle of ground which could be occupied, that we are sure tnat there could not be less than 2,300 persons present; and we are told that the net proceeds of this concert to the charity trill amount to no less a sum than 1000 guineas. It would also be improper in us to take our leave of it without remarking that the arrangements of it were exceedingly well go tup, and that we have never seen assembled in one place a greater portion of beauty and respectability.
Her Majesty on leaving the Mansion-house was loudly greeted "by the populacd, and her carriage drove off at half past 10 o’clock, amidst the loudest acclamations of the surrounding multitudes.

MR. MOSCHELRS' CONCERT. I
±'sr. issOscMe1es gave his armnual concert last night at the Argyll-rooms, the spacious area of whioh was crowded to overflov with fashionable company; musical connoisseurs, and tle ead' be of the profession. As a or. er_
the pian onrte, MTr. Aloscheles must be placed In.the-verySrrst rank of his art; and if we consider the variety of power he displays, thbre are few names indeed, which deserve to stand on the same level with his. In the neatnesR and rapiditv of his execution he leaves nothing to be desired, and combines with those qualities a graceful elegance of expression which was considered a novelty in the art till others acquired it by imitating himn, and by the practic of his compositions. As a composer, too, be must be allowed to possess great talent, and his management of the fanciful embroiderv of a simple sub cot, without destroying the mdlody, forms in him a pa,cuuar merit. His first piece in the performances of last night was a MIS. concerto, by Hummel, played for the first time in this country. As a compositlon, wit] the exception of the slow movement, it was below mediocrity, an the accompaniments, in the true German style, too often overpowered and destroyed the brilliancy of the pincipal instrtument. In the second act of the concert mr. Moseheles, however,gave a piece in which his full talent both as a composer and performer was displayed. le designates it his ' Recollections of Ireland; a fartasiafor the piano-forte, with orchestral accompaniments." The plan of the composition, if it may be said to have a plan, is wild and irneg-ar. Like the bee roving from flower to flower, he snatcheg in succession well-known beauiiful national airs of the sister kingdom, and clothes them, without destroying their beauty, in the richest yet most c aracteristic decoration. Each passage confessed the band of the master, and the performance, which. was just of the proper length to keep the attention unimpaired was honoured at its conclusion with the most livdy appiause. But MIr. Moscheles did not, as other great protessors have done, trust to himself for the sole attraction. 1. Von Weber, who presided together with Sir ff. Smart, conducted the orchestra in several of his own compositions, consistng of the noble overture to his opera of Euruanthe, equallysuiking and original, thoughless known than the celebrated overture to Frreschutz; an air, with recitative, channingly sung, by Madame Caradori; and a
nd scene from Freischustz, by Mr. Brahsm. 31. Von .Weber did not himself perform, but directed by his hand the movement of the orchestra, the spirit and krecision ot which evinced the animatior his presence inspirea. A concertante for two violoncellos, b' the celebrated Lindley and his son was interesting, from the relationship of the performers, ant
the anxious desire evinced by the veteran to raise the estima. tion of his pupil withl the public to the same rank as his own. rlf. Furstenau gave some variations to a Scoteb air on the flute, with distinctness and vapidity ef articulation more rmmarkable than the truth of his intonation. The second part was opened by a,conrertante for two horns, by the well-known Tchunke and his brother (the first aVp2ar ance of the latter), which was cleverly acted, but ineflslient. That instrument miust not be allowed to desert its station in the orchestra iDr concerto playing, to which its mechanism is wholly inadequate. A fantasia oni the violinby Br.

Alr. Braham also introduced a Spanish national air, the words of whicl have been set into English verse for this occasion by Dr. Bowvring. iladame Camporese received a cordlial welcome on the part of the audience the moment she made her appearance, and sang Mozart's Parto, mna mt bemmio, in excellent style, with the usual
paniment on the clarionet by Afr. Willman. The liberal support which the public have. given to the exertions of the'committee on this occasion will, we understand, be productive of all the advantage which could possibly have been desired. It was asserted by many in the hall, that upwards of 2 000 tickets had bees sold, and the persons present cerlainly aid not fall far short of that number. About twothirds of the audience consisted of ladies, and the coup dceil offered by the variety of their elegant dresses was picturesque in the extreme.

PROFESSIONAL CONCERT.
Last night a concert was given at the Argvll Rooms, under the management, as the bills and advertisemiients stated, of a Committee of Professors of Music, though the object was not mentioned. The entertainments were of a very superior kind, both as regarded the selection of the pieces and thc style in which they were performed. Madamne Camporese's admirable execution of Parfo, ma ft be} mnio, and Di piecer, is too generally known to require description, if indeed desctiption could convey any idea of its excellence. In the rest of the vocal pieces, rMademoiselle Blasis Sir. Braharn, SignordeBegnis, and Messrs. E.TaylorandPhilips,lent their powerfulaid. Alady (M adlameCellinii) madelherfirst appearance in London. Thebillsstated that she hadeomefrom theTh-atre Italien at Paris. 11We suspect, however, that her rank there was rather'of a subordinate kimd; but she is young, and consequtently has ample time for that improvement which jndg ing from the chaste style of her performance iast nigiht, we should be inclined to expect she will attain. The instrumen. tal part of the concert was, we .think, fully umore interesting and attractive than the vocal. Beethoven's pastoral svm-
*phony was listened to with rapture, and Mrs. Anderson's pianoforte faneasia was admirable. M e never heard a female performet possessing so thorough a command of the instrumlent. Mrs. Aniderson has, in perfection, that strength of hand wvithout which there can be no real delicacy of touch. The fantasia, which is the composidon of Hlerz, abounds in all the difficulties of the modern school, w. hich, howvever, ihfrs.Anderson surmounted with apparent fa. cility.

KINIG'S THEAiTRE.
On Sttnulard evening Rossini's Itali4na in Al4ieri was performed by thlC pupils of the Royal Academy of Mlusic, il the Iniior theatrc of this establishment, commonly called thc King's Concert-room. The selection of this opera, so frequently representetlin the course of last season, was apparently made as aftior(ditig means of comparison whcreby a just estdniate could be tbnned of the respective qualifications of some of thejuvenile pertormerq. The rcsult hlas fully justified the choice, anti has proved as gratifying to cvcry disinterested well-wisher ot' the institution wiho witnessed this spesimen of its utility, as to the persons more immediately concerned in its prosperitv. The principal characters ont this occasion devolved on AMiss Childe (as Isabel az), Miss Tuckecr (as Eleira), M7iss Bromlev (as Zulima), MIr. Seguin (as Muxst -p/ta), Mlr. Brizzi (as l indoro), ,Mr C. S. Packer (as Thaddco), and lr. F. Smith (as if alp). The orchestra, snich one or two exceptions entirely composed of pupils of the Academy, was led bv i\lr. C. A. eymor, the senior first violin. In a performance where the chief merit has consisted in perfectioR of the ensemnb/, it is lhardly possible to dwell on individual personationls without appearing to detract from that equal tribute of praise which is due to all. It is therefore only because the most conspicuous characters of the libretto are entitled to more than general notice, that we must make a few distinctions in their favour. Miss Childe sustained her part in a manner which would have done credit to many a more experienced prima donna on the Italian stage. Her carriage is easy and graccfal, and her deportment, without betraying any departure from tbv most becoming modesty, did not in any instance e,inee any of that embarrassment which is almost inseparable from the earlier attempts in her professional career. A great improvement has taken place both in the compass and ftexibility of her voice * and the progress of her studies has enabled her to do ample justice to the difficult music assigned to Isabella. Slie met with a highly-favourable reception from the audience on her first appearance on the stage, and herelhbrts were rewarded with abundant applause througliout the performance. Her share of the duct with Tlsnddeo " Ai capricei della sorte," gave particular satisfaction, anti
the hwborus manner in which it was given bv both tte cantanti, elicited an ecore. But the higisest and most de. serving tribute of approbation was paid to her in the grand and difficult aria in the sixth scene of tite second at, " Peissa al/a pastria," in which shie tlisplaycd great powers of execution and a highly-cultivated and well-6usished musical taste. Mtiss Tucker is vet a less confident pertbrmer than Miss Childe, this being her first experiment on the theatrical boards. Nevertheless. she has evinced great progress of vocal attainment, and holds oat good promise. Of Miss Bromley we ma>y speak in terms ot' still more positive prediction, provided the compass of her voice improvc with the development of ber person. She appears yet very young; but in thselittle assigned to her in the insignificant part Of Zn/Zma, she distinguished herself both as a highly premising actress and as an able vocalist. Want of confidence will nerer be a bar to lier success in the theatrical career. Since we last had an opportunity of liearing Mir. Seguin, his voice has acquired a deeper and fuller tone, and its cultivation has evidently been industriously kept up. Indeed, it is difficult to meet with a bass voice at once so flexible, and of so deep a compass in a person of his ears. He divided the suffrages of the audience with illiss Childe, and was particularly successful iri the aria of the seventh scene, Or sli tengo, which received great applause. In point of power of voice, MIr. Brizzi has not exhibited mucit progress since he last appeared an the theatrical boards, about a year ago; but his musical taste and style of sineing have undergone great improvement, and be did full justice te the beautiful air in the third scene of the first act, Langiuir' per una bella. Mr. Beizzi is the son of an cminent Italian vocalist, and'he is himself bom in Italy, where he has received the principal part of his musical educatinn. These circumstances gave him over the other performers the advantake of a superior scenic tact, anti cotisequently of a more appropriate dramatic action. He has evidently paid particular attention to Signor Donzelli's late personation of Lindoro, and has been at great pains to copy that great master, His success has been as complete as circumstances could admit of. Ir. C. S. Packer is not a vocal pupil of the Academy. He usually presides at the pianofbne at tie Academy's concerts. On this occasion he un*mertook the part of Thaddeoat a short notice, owing to some unforescen occurrence,and the indulgence oftheaudience was bespoken ott his behalf. Thtis precaution was unnecessary. MIr. Packer filled the part with much comic humour, and to the great anusement of the audience. He has but lit. tie voice, but he made ithe best use of it,andsangwithgreatfacilicy. The part of He/ti was not misplaced in the hands of MIr. F. Smsith. M'c havenot seen it better sustained by more experienced actors than himself at the King's Theatre, nor, indeed, of late, so wvell. Mr. Smith possesses a very fine voice, and much aptitude fbr the stage. One of the most remarkable features of this performance was the superior manner in which the orchestra went through its duties. The accompaniments were executed with a remarkable precision of timc,and agreat attention topianos andforte .The overture Was very ably executed, and an attempt was ttade to encore it, but it was not successful. The time at which tc oallegro was taken was rather deficient in spirit, and this is a fault which wehave more than once observed in the execution of pieces by this orchestra, the effect of which depends upon the quickness of time. In the introductory slow movement, the solos by Mr. Lucas on the violoncello, by MIr. Cooke on the oboe, were mtuch applauded. A crowvded audience of various persons of distinction attended to witness the performance. After the curtain had dropped, a general call was made for the re-appearance of the principal dramatis personae, who once more came forward, and bowed to the complimentary plaudits of the audience. It is due to the directors of the Academy to state, that this perlbrmance, and two other similar ones which are to follow it, liave been prepared under the immediate and exclusive direction of the Committee of Management.

CONCEkRT AT GUILDHALL.
On Saturdaymoymin n ucert took place at Guildhall, for the benefit of the distressed weavers atSpitalfields and Bethnal-green. The performance consisted of the Oratorio of the Messiah. WVe were at first inclined to think that the seleetion of this composition was somewhat injudicious, the object being to excite general interest rather than to gratif, the select few; but the intense attention with which the perform ance was listened to by a numerous and rather mixed anudience proved that we were-mistaken, and afferded convincing evidence that Handel wrote not only "for all -fine," but for all tastes. .-Though the masterpieceof thegreat master is-so familiar as to bekmown almost by heart by all who bestow attention: to music, yet tbh splendid and complete manner intwhich it -was heard on Saturday, imparted to it an air of novelty. It was performed, as we believe it now invariably .is, writh the addition of Mozart's accompaniments, which were composed at the request of Baron Von Swieten, of Vienna, with the view of bringing the work as near as possible to a level with the great progress in instrumce tal music. These additions, albeit profane in the estimia. tioa of the exclusive admirers of what has laeen flippantly denominated the "yty-wig school " cannot fail to gratify ears accustomed to the rich orchestral combinations of more recent composers. Mozart's addidons to the Messiah are chiefly confined to the airs, and they consist for the most part of the introduc.o, of harmonies for the wind instruments, which in Handel's time were but sparingly employed. The numerous orchestra at Guildhall rendered the beauty of Mlozart's decorations strikingly manifest. The performers, both vocal 3iid instrumental; contributed their exertions gratuitously. The orchestra,yhich was led by Mr. F. Cramer, and conducied by Sir G. Smart, boasted the powerful talents of Mlessrs. Lindley; Dragenetti, Nicholson, WVillman, and other eminent instrumentalists; while the vocal department presented thevelit4 of our English singers- viz.-liss Patoi, Mirs. W. Xnyvett, Mfessrs. Braham, ]l. Tylor, Philli.s,&c. The chorus -was as comnplete as could be desired. Brahiasu of courset opehed the Oratorio, for as long as he lives, or at least as 'long as he sings, "CUomfort Je," and " Every valley," must continue his exclusive domain, on which ne intruder can venture to encroachwith impunity. Often as we have heard him execute this divine composition, he never pleased us! better than on Saturday. His fine voice seemed to be melowed by the vast space, and every syllable he uttered must have been distinctly audible in the remotest corner of the hall. Lis closing cadence however, wvas not exactly in ~good taste.
W6e should -like to- Lear Hrandel's songs without additions of this sort, wrbich are w ell calculated to elicit the plaudits of a theatrical audience but are quite incong>ruous in music likee that of the Messiaih. Miss Paton's "Rejoice greatl was very brilliant4:and in " There were shepherds," she ma, naged the sotto vcoe passages with great delicacy. Mrs W. Knyvett's beautiful voice and chaste style of executon were pertecty aptropriate to the songs allotted tO her; and the bass
atopq were admirably sung by Messrs. E.Taylor and Phillips.
To no inconsiderable porton of the audience the bonne oouche of the whole performance was a song from Uademoiselle Sontag, introduced between the first and second parts of the oratorio. This treat was the more gratifying, inasmuch as it was in some iseasure unexpected. The accomplished syren arrived, in London only last Tuesday, and on beng informed of the intended concert and its benevolent obh ject, she immediately tendered the aid of her powerful talent. Mhe sang 0uglielmi's Graias. agimus in a style which afforded convincng proof that her excellence is not merely confined to forid execution. Her voice has lost none of its delicios silvery 8weetness; and with regard to poPwer (which,after
a,isa secondary consideration with those who prefer music to noise), we are inclined to believe it has increased rather than diminished since we heard her daring the last opera season. Het singing on Saturday certainly exhibited no trace of the feebleness of -which hypercritis have sometimes thought proper to couiplain, and we are at a loss to conceive a bbtter teat ofa singer's power of voice thanl an effective per- - formance in such-a place as GuildhalL She sang Gretias agnIus Rwith'exquisite&briliancy and spirit; and the extraordinary facilitt and accuracy with whiich she exeeuted the catena di t7ills,must have astonished those who have not witnessed the facility -with which slhe can perforrsi feats of far greater difficulty4 WiDman?s obligato accompaniment on the clarionetWwas delicious and the performannce excited a rapturous aind ubiversal snworc.
The bills enumerated a long list ofiroyal andiaoble patrons and -patronesses, and, judging from the multitude of persons who filled the hall, it maY he presumed that a considerablo sum has been raised for the charitable purpose for which the profits of the concert are destined.,

KING'S CONCERT ROOM.
This room having xecently undergone a variety of repairs, embellishments, and decorations, which have given it the ap. pearance of a very elegant little theatre, was opened last night with a grand concert of vocal and instrumental music. Thirty handsome and commodious boxes have been built at the end of the room fronting the stage, and that portion of the pit which is immediately under them has been so raised as to enable persons seatedthereto commandafull And uninterrupted vriew of the whole room. A good sized ante-chamber has been provided for ladies to wait for their carriages in, as well as for serving refreshments, and has been laid oit with elegant ard abundant furniture. Theprimidpalvocal perfonnances last night were sustained by Mademoiselle Sonta- Mladame Pinroni, and Madame Mlalibran; Signori ZucChe2i, Curioni, Donselli, Bordogni, Lerasseur, and Graziani, being altogether the elite of the efficient company attached to the Ital5an Opera this season. A duet between Madame Pisaroni and Mademoiselle Sontag, from Semiramide. wva greatly applauded and certainly attorded one of the happiest specimens of vocai perfection that was ever witnessed on any stage. Mon. sicur Rousselot executed a pot-pourri on the violoncello, with orchestral accompaniments. The extreme dificulty of this conmposition called for a full display of his powers on the instrument, and he exhibited a command over it which rarely taUs to the lot of violoncecllo players. To the facility and neverhiling precision w.ith which he went over the most intricate and rapid passages, he added a remarlushle delicacy of expression, and a rare eleganee of style. AnothernastrumentalexhibiCei
which, without giving cqjual pleasure, excited greater wonder, was the executioa of some variations on Di tantipalpiti,by Mr. Sclmidt on the trombone. Mr. Schmidt has evidently gone through a vast deal of labour and perseverance, in order to bring that instr-ument to the level of the keyed wrind insetru. monts, and his pains have been crowned with all the success that he could have expected. Nevertheless the trombone can never become - principal instrumer,t in its present shap,and its tones are far :netter suited to the msilitary band than the concert-room.

IHANOVER-SQ UARE ROOMS.
Yesterday morning a concert took place at the above rooms, for the benefit of Miss Chambers, a lady wvbo, we understand, is compelled by unfortunate circumstances to exercise professionally talents nnd accomplishments which were originally cultivated for the recreation and embeDishment of private life. Alnost all the principal singers now in London tendered their assistance on the occasion, and the excellence of the performances was calculated to render the concert highly interesting, independently of every other consideration. The program7e announced the attractive names of Mlesdames Camporese and Stockhausen, Signors Velluti, Curioni, Dpnzelli, &c. Miss Chambers also took part in the vocal performances. It is, how-ever, unnecessary to enter into any criticism on this part of the concert, and we shall therefore confine ourselves to a brief notice of some young instrumentalists whose names are as yet but little knoyn to the public, and whose performances accordingly claimed the interest of novelty. Miss flicns, a pnpil of Alr. Moschelles, played a fantasia on the pianofortc in a style which affords good reason to anticpate that she will one day rank among our most distinguished pianistes. The piccewas mosclhellev's Fall of Paris, or to give the air its true name 'a iraq the peculiar difficulties of which are well known to pianoforte pracfitioners. The neatness and accuracy of Milss Dickens's touch anti execution elicited deserved approbation. A duet on the violin and violoncello, by'M)IM. Tolbecq and Rousselot, displayed astonishing powvers of execution in both performers; and Mlademoiselle Despourrin's solo on the harp was a very pleasing performance. 1Mr. Pio Cianchettini; w ho otficiated as conductor of the orchestra, also executed a solo on the piano in his peculiarly brilliant style.

Mo3cheles and Lindley chiefly eomposed of variations for the voice, pianofbrtei aAd violonccllo, onthe well-knownairof"Th.eSwissboy." This piece was last year brought out as a dUiet, at the concert given for the benefit of its cornptVbY' Pixis, so that it possessed no sbare of novety be,,on the addition of the violoncello part - hut which, falliri into such hands as these of Lindle' added no small portion of interest to the perfo-inianch. ilid ee
it seerned to be one in whicb tbreq of the greatest musical practitianers of the da'y had vied *ith each other for a auperior display of their respetPle bowers. The applause bestowed on their exertions vas so equal, that it was impossible to dls. cover any partial feelir,g on the part of the audience. iladame Malibran sang "1 Tu chc accendi" with an expression and a simplicity which formed a pleasing contrast with the ornamental shape in which the cavatina hasI for years, been given by almost every other professional votalist, fbr the pinrpoe 'o imparting variety to its charms. a 4uet of b&eeairelhid, h- tween Mladame Malibkah and Madte'oi§elle &nOtag, was also listened to Wvith gteat dehti t I t e *iourse'of the concert, Mr. Afoseheles txecuted thtee new pieces of -his own composition, consisting of a fantasia, a concertante with L{nd'sey, and an extempore copriccio. ft would be almost superfluoustosay,thathe displayed alldhat brilliancy and elegance of style which he is so well knowrt to have at command. The staccato nzeatness of his most rapid p3ssages, and the distinctiness with which he dwells on thb same note in each of a long succession of bars of dlouble crotchets, are ne veliet
in the style of pianoforte playing which owe their origin and perfection to him. ln his coijpositions, howvever, Mr. Moscheles is a great deal too apt to call to aid the inspira tons of others, and Rossini's vocal music has muca too great a share in the construction of his own. In all the solo pieces lie performed on this occasion, a varihty bf that composer's melodies, as well a some Scotcl airs, were introduced. Rossini is unquestionably the first opera composer of the day, but bc 4661 meant that what he has assigned to the voice tlThad be equallv applicable to In. struments. There Is a kind of rage prevalent among the instrumeuibA composcrs and adapters of the day fMl every thiiug that bears the name of Rossini vwhich is.easily accdttnted for;, but, unluckilRv this mania is kept up and encouraged by the public taste of sucl men, therefore, as Dlr. AMoscheles, who have the power of exercising a great ascenclancy over the musical world, it is expected that they should lead that taste into its legitimate channel, instead of vitiating it and consolidating its errors by a servile compliance with its frivolities and caprices. It is quite sufficiently notorious that Dlr. D!oscheles-than vhoni no one understands better the resources '3? the. instnrmehit which he profes-es-is in no wa'E of the assistance either of Rossini's songs, or of those semi-barbarus oddities which the bagpipe-blowers r, the wild EHighlands of Scetland miscall melodiks, in order to enhance the popularity of his coinPositins. If musical genius has reason to complain of want 'Of encoiragement in this country it is precisely becaue little is done towards purifying the public taste, and every thing that tends to perpetuate its frivolous and wrongful tendrncy is resorted to by the very persons rvho have most reason to tdeplore its perversion. But the audiencea who attehd Mr. hloscheles's concerts are chiefly com?,osed of persons to a more or less extent skillad in thte scienCe and practiceof music.' To them Rossini'samclotlits, alranged for the pianoforte, bear the appearan e of trifles, and the Scotch airs are insufferable. Their ears have, besides, been sufficiently put under the test of endurance by repetitions without- cnd of the same things at the Oper;, at all the other theatres, at concerts, at balls, at private parties, and in the very streets. Those persoins therefore expect such novelty as is properly suited to instruniental execution, and not vocal imitations. Mr. Moschcles, however, received abundance of those complimentary testimonies on the part of his brilliant audience to which his eminent station in the musical world entities him.

The third of the series bf morning concerts announced at these rooms took place yesterday. It was greatly superior to that of the preceding Friday, good as that was. Madame Malibran wss added to the list of vocal perforrmers she sang an aria by Mlercadante; and with Mademoiselle Sontag, the grand scena from Semnirazimide "Blben ate fezisci." Thelatter, with which the concert closea was a splendid nerformance, and will not besoon forgotten by 'those who had te good fortune to hear it. Tke two highly gifted singers seemed to vic with each other in adding every possible grace and ornament to the composition, and it was altopether one of the most extraordinary specimens of vocal execduon we ever remem ber to have heard. Another perfoimance which possessed' the twofold charm of excelence and novelty,, was a scnea from the Freischutz in the original Germian, by M. Rosner. The bills- did not state whether this. gentlemsn, with whose name we were not previously acquainted, made his debut on this occasion. But be this,as it' may, he is entitled to rank among the Teri first order of singers, and his ippearance was aen important acquisition to the concert. His voice is a tenor of considerable compass, particularly in depth, and remarkable at once for its:timsre -and its power.
'V. Resner sang that masterly scesa from lVeber's opera, in' which.Meat expresses his de.pairathis ill success in the shooting match, and laments the disappointment-which the iUl news will occasion to his nistfess. The recitative commences Nein, langer teag%'ich sicht-die qualen, and then changes to the beautiful aria Dunreh die Walder, durch die Auen. n. Rlosner was particularly happy in the racitative'passages, in which the composer has employed such an immense power of instrumental accompaniment, that few voices are able to compete with it. The other vocal perform. ers were Mademoisele Blasis and Signora Velluti, Curioni, Pellegrini and Torri De Beriot performed a fantasia on the violin, ant a young gentleman, Al. Schulz (who we presume is a det.utante in this country), played Hertz's variations, sUa Frnchette est charmantc, on the pianoforte. To name 'this piece is sufficient (to thosewho are acquaintedwith it) to conyey an idea of the extrzordinary power of executionrequired in-the performer who attempts it. We have not room to enter into details, but we must not omit mentioning M. Schulk's per. tbnnance of the fifth variation, the peculiar difficulty of*vhich consists in the rapid crossing of the left hand ever the right. The notes thus played with the left-hand are quavers in qu ick allegro time, and consist irn some instances of intervals of upwards of four octaves. Al. Schulz's performance was rapturously applauded. It was of course highly interesting to an audience of whom more than three-fourths were ladies. The concert-room was crowded to excess by a highly fashion. ablefissemblage.

It would be unnecessary to dwell here, on the subject of AMr. Lindley's unrivalled powers on the violoncello. They have'for.agreat number of years repeatedly excited the admiration-of.' persons of all conditions, and the profound silence with which he is invariably listened to in quarters where musical exhibitions of a superior kind are seldom appreciated; has alwvays shown the estimation in whichl his talent is held, even in a greater degree than the bursts of applause which are elicited by the brilliancy of his execution, and the deliqacy and expression of his. notes. - There are few, b) this time, within the UJnited Kingdomai, who have not heard Mr. Lindley's performance; but even them-his fame cannpt have failed to reach, Alademoiselle Sontag, MIadame Stockhansen, Mliss 1'.

I BIRMLZ&H4M MUSICAL PESTIP-AL, Oot. 8.
The concert last night wsvmuch better attended, a3 We anticipated, than that of the preceding night. There was no attempt at an opera. It was a regular orchestral performance, and therefore much better tnderstood and relished than the foolish dramatic representation of the preceding night-not that there was any thing very exeellent (compared with what there Inight have been) in the scheme. The concert began with Beethoven's admirable Sinfonia in C major. Except by the Philharsnonic band, we have seldom heard it better played. The first thinf by far in point of vocal excellence, was Malibran'ss Ecco iW punto, 0 Vitellia." A more finished and perfect specimen of the highest style of the opera seria we never heard. Nor was WViUman's accompaniments on the corno bassetto at all inferior to the singing. Signor Costa does not rise in our opinion. His intonation was again very imperfect; and, common as this fault is in the vocalists of Italy, there is no excellence whichcan compensate for it.
The performance of The Messiah this mornin- necessarily abridges our notice of this day's proceedings. it is played so often by the same band and sung by the same singers, that it goes like a piece of well-constructed machinery. We anticipate every note and every effect. The chief novelty--and that is only a novelty here-was the addition of AMozart's accompaniments. It is rather strange that a festival which has been used to lead the public taste should be, in this case, the last to follow it, and that in a point on which all first-rate musicians have long been agreed. We cannot help noticing an instance of wretclhed taste in the allotment of the air, " Be shall feed his flock," to Mliss F. Ayton, who, as if on purpose to place herself in the worst possible position, came into the orchestra too late for the first part of the song, which was therefore sung by Miss Paton. Miss F. Ayton, disdaining to take a lesson in the performnance of Handel's song from that lady, gave to the latter half of it her own reading, and nothing coul ba worse in every respect. We advise her never again to commit herself, and insult her hearers, by such an exhibition. ' HQw beautifu are the feet" is usually allotted to the most inferior soprano in the orchestra. It was to-day sung by iUrs. Knyvett, and, in her hands, it was one of the most effective airs in the oratorio Malibran was to have sune, "1 know that my Redeemer liveth;" bat it was exchang. ed for "l Rejoicegreatly," Miss Paton taking the former. Admirably as that lady sang it, we regretted the change as we awaited with considerable curiosity the reading waich Malibran would have given it. A tame and commnon-place singing of the mere notes we are sure it wvould not have been; but, probably warned by her former failure, she shrunk from the perfonnance of a song in which so very few artists have §u6ceceded.

The only advene feeling experienced by her lauditom was occasion' d by the abrubt conclusion of the performance at the end of the first part of the concerlo. Similar curtailments must be deprecaled, and should( never be resorted to at these concerts, which, uniketnost of the public concerts riven In the metropolis, are not
meant to serve as a mere pretext for a mpney specu!atlon. The i practice of giving three or four vocal pieces rt successien should also be correctti. Variety is the greatest charm ot music, and Wshere the interest of vocal music is not incessantly kept up through tI, *gency of dramatic incident, as In opcrrs, a certain languor and heviness: wlil -soon pervade even the best sustained perfor. mances.

o tntrummental as to vocal music. The second part of Saturday's concert wvas opened by one of those symphoniesof Handel in which oblinu passages are assigned to the principal violin. hr.

PIHILHARMOANZC SOCIETY.
Thc fourth concert, which was givei on Alenday evening, oplned with Aozart's symphony in C. It Is but fair to expect from such sn orchestra, that an annual performance of this composition would aimoot ensure perection: but there occarfed,nevertheless in the liTSt movement,passages of disorder and confusion whic' were only retrieved by some strokes of the bow vigorously appled by the leader, Signor Spagnoletti, to the desk from which be was playing. This method may be very useful to the performers in bringing them back to the true rhvthm ; but it is to be doubted whether thte most " music-maa- among the audience will place it In thic list of their gratifications. With flarnlct we should say, "Reform it al. together," gentlemen. Saplo next gave an atir from Weber's Buryanthe which we could have pmised the more, hadthe abstained from thtat description of cadence with wlhlch Bra. ham is wont to draw down the applause of the galleries at our patent theatres. Illorart's Nofturno, In eight parts, all wvind instrmentst which followed, is one of the most delightful compostions of that great mnaster, and is ca. nabtc of an effect truly enchanting, rere elc principal part intruated to a performer able to do it justice. The fault was however in the directors of thc concert, {n placingayoung and inexperieneed performer in so responsible a situation. Of th seena from Ilummel, " Deh Cama," which was sung by MUadame Stocklausen, that portion of the eflect which de. pended on the performuer was decidedly good, and confers on herthe rank not merely of a good, but a highly intellectual singer. The oompositiob Is muclh bencath what we ought to expect from a profesrsor of such arest reputation as Htum. mel. It Itms no claim to originality, ana is in fact a cento or rather patchwork from MLozart. The overture to Der B re,'gest by Spohr, which dlosed the act, was well executed.
The concert was resumed by Haydn's 7th symphony, welcomed as it descrvedto be, by the audience,as an od fivourite. Air. Phillips then sang the 3cena, "pace ardente," from Euryonlhe, one of-theimost beautiful productions, perhaps, that Weber has ever comnposed. PhDllips's conception of it was good though he was deficient in the power requisite to draw fGrtU its most striking effects. Beethoven's quintetc iso C thiough highly applauded, was a disappointment to thore who knew how to appreciate the true style and the splendid passagts oftlis unrivalled composition. Mr.Onry, who played the first violin, is a professor of undoubted talent, but seems to have done his best duiring his late visit to the continent to pervertit from it tiueobjects,or hewouldnot have thought of gafting the tinsel ornaments of French and Italian music on the manlv stockof Beethoven. He had the forture, how. ever, to be the " spoiled child" of the evening, anc was well rectevea, like the prodigal son, who went into foreign parts and spent all his substance. After a duet from Spohr's Jessorido, " Belts Ninfa " had been well sung by A!adame Stockhausen end Air.Sapio,thenverture to Lonara,byBeetboren, was played, and though placed at the end of the concert, was the gem of the evening. But its beauties are of too re. fined a character to be estimaled by a miiixed audience, and it is probably reserved to a ftiture age to assign to Bcetisoveti his true rank. M.

CONCERT-IOOhM, KING'S THEA TRE.
Mlozart's excellent opera, Cosi fan Stuz, was performed on Saturday evening by the pupil5 of the Royal Academy of

Miss Osborne appeared for the first time in the ch.ametetr of the Soubrctte. Wc bore last year ample testimony to the accurate and tfihective manner in which this opera was represented here. With an equal adherence to truth, we must say that last Saturday's performatice of it came considerably short of every expectation. It was executed in a generally careless manner, and most of the dramats pcrsonce appeared as if they were making a first private experiment of their qualificatlons for the stage. T' here was sometlhing which seemed to be incessantly diverting attention from the business of the scene, and to cxcite a kind of a side.way merriment among them, which was totally destuctive of dramalic illusion. These childish liberties should not be passed over by those whose business it is to prevent 'heir recurrence. The-singing, which sufiered materially from them, was spiritless and indifferent. 3Miss Bromley, indeed, was suddenly taken ill in the course of tke evening, and appeared, for some time, to labour under the ef'ects of her indisposition ; but our remarks do not apply to the partofherperformunce the defects of which arose from that cause. There is one necessary quality which the generality of the pupils of this Acadeny who have hitherto appeared before the public in dramatic representatioRs are singularlydeficientin.Wemean adistinctarticulation.Itisfrequently impossible to catch aword of what they utter.The voungladies are more remarkable for this defect than the male pupils, and from the latter's participation we can only entirely except lMir.

le have to noice two intcresting musical entertainments yhich took place yesterday-one in the morning, the other n the evening.
r F. Preumavr's concert, which was postponed on acainunt of his late Majesty's death, was given in the morning
the King's Concmt-rooms. The audience were entertained witlt an admirable selection of music, vocal and instrumental. >f the latter, Ilr. Preumayr's performance was, perhaps, the mnst attractie, on account of its peculiar style. On Mlr. PreuBnayr's first appearance in this country, we noticed his masterly per6frmance on the bassoon and it is now only necessary to lay that the pieces selectea for yesterday's concert weze of a nat-are to display his talents in the most conspicuous way. I Madanie 1lalibran, who appears to be entirely recovered from
her late indisposition, sang several favourite pieces in her very best style. The other vocal performers wvere Madame Stockhausen, Mtits Riviere, Signors Donzelli, Lablache, Santini, De Begnis, and Begrez. Lablache took the bass in AMartini's Vadasi t ia di qua, vwhich of course lost none of its comic effect by this new aleotment of the part.
Signor Torn gave a concert last night, at the residence of IS ~A. GraEvillo, Grafton-stheet. He had engaged almost the wh ole of the vocal talent at present il London; and from the juclous selection of the pieces, and the superior style of their exEcution, the concert proved a great musical treat. Signori Denzelli, De Begnis, Santini, Lablache, and Curioni, Madame Lalande, Malibran, Puzzi, and lUademoicelie Blasis, contri buted greatly by their powerful talents to the evening's eli tertainment; but owing, perhaps, to the lateness of the hour, all the pieces enumerated in the programme were not su nr. The audience was numerous and fashionable.
We may take this opportunitv of mentioning the first series of a musical publcation entitled Lays of a Wanderer, which ha.s just appeared. It consists of a coUection of songs, semo in the German language, some in the English, vwith reciprocal translations, and set to music by Walther. The German wcmrds are, for tbe most part, by the composer, Mr. iValther, wl lo has transferred to that language some pleasing verses by DI r. T. H. Stirling, and others. The translations are remark. able for their close resemblance to the original, and the music hits the merit of being equally well adapted to the words of b,sth languages. The collection contains the beautiful verses of Goethe, beginning Ich denike deis, Mllr. Walther's translhdon of which is very creditable to his talents. We think th c plan of this work would have been considerably improved h::d the editor presented to the English public, not only Gerioan wordp, but German mnsic-namcly,a collection of those beautiful melodies in whirli Germany is so rich-richer, perbrips, than any otber country.

HUIUMBL'S CONCERT.

On a fo-mer occssion we pointed out what wre conceive to be the peculliar beauties of Mr. iummel's playinge and tbose beauties were never, perhaps, more conapicuouafy. developed than yesterday morning. Therc is a magic in M~r. Hummcl's touch, especdaLly in his execution of light and brilliant passages in the upper part of the insteument, of which the playing of no other piaist, except J. B. Cramer, can afford an ides. The grand our de force between lMlessrs.

He selected two or three from a number of themes wbich were presented to him, and the audience were at once charmed and astonishede by the beauty and variety of the composition and slAlI of the performance. Thefacillity with which ir. Hum. mel passes from one subject to another in his.extempore perform ances, exhibiting every variety of style in composition and playing, is truly astonibhing.

REBUILDING of thc EBGLISH OPERA HOUSE.
A ofceting of friends of Mr. Arnold, and pattons of the mnusical drama, was beld yesterday, in the Concert Room of the Kin-'s Theatre, for the purpose of taking into consideTation the best method oF assisting In rebuilding the E3nglish Opera Housc, and re-establishing the English Operas.
At 2 o'clock about 200 gentlemen had assembled; among tlieni were, the Marquis or Ailesbury the Earl of Clarendon, the Marquis of Salisbury, Lord Castleresgb, Lord Saltoun, Sir Geo. Clerk, Sir Andrew Barnard, General lVynysrd, Sir George Smart, Sir IV. 'reemantle and a number of persons well known in the musical and theatrical world, including Meses. lMathems, Y-ates, H.Phillips, Braley, FitzWilliam,&c.
The Marquis oftAsL Mssory Was ceUed to the chair.
The noble ChcA1nt r.,x having inBirmed the meeting of the object for which it had been convened, namely, to take into consideration a plan for re-building and re-gstablishing the English Opera, stated that he had been requested to lay before them a summary ef the proceedings of the committee c6nstituted for that purpose. He had been indisposed for several days, in consequence of a severe cold, and was now suffering unaer an affection of the throat, so that he was afraid he should hardly be able to make himself heard. However, being disposed to assist Mr. Arnold, and lend his aid to the re-establishment of his theatre, he had muadca point of coming down. He should say but little on thesubject, and it was the less necessary to do so, aS the report of thc conmittee would explain masters fuly and more salisfactorily thanhe could pretend to do. 'his,however,he might observe, that he feltanxlous thdt the theatre should be rebuilt ns soo n as Possible, and was
pregarea to co every tUnig in his powver to promote tue accom-
ment of that object.
The noble Marqlus was about to read the report, when Mr. George Robins proposed, that in order to save his lordship trouble, it should be read by Mlr. blayber, Mr. Arnold's solicitor.
The suggestion having been adopted-
Mr. MayheP rea(d the report, which was as follows:-
" It may perhaps be desirable to put the trecting in pn5ess}n of the preliminary measures the committee have thouRht it necessary us idopt. Learming with pain, that in consequence of the omission .f 31r. Arnold to insure the property for 8,0001., which by his lese besras bound to have done, a forfeiture had been iucurred, they took theearliestepportunity of seeking a conference with the ielocitors of the Marquis of Exreter. Mr. Arnold'. grourdulandlord. thc result of which was a proposition made on the part of the com. mittee, and communicated by the solicitors to hi, Lordship. In reply to which propDssitis, the SMarquis, althouRh declning to w.ave his right of re-entry, is pleased to express his regret at bMr. Arnold's misiostune, and his Lordship's strong inclination tn assist him by granting a new lease, should itr. Anold find himself in. condition to rebulid the theatre. In a just confidence that the expoctation thus held out by his Lordship will be eventually realized. the committee did not he itate a moment in taking such steps as seemed to them best calculated to promote this otject. A meeting wsas sceordingly convened of the old renters for tlieadlusunentol their claims, and the committee are gratifiedl in being able to statc that a large majority of them most liberally consented at once to abadon a great prorrtionoftheir annuites, teo stpone evesntheir remaining claims in mevourofthenewrenters ad to relinquish their free admissions, which were sccured to them under the debisitures.

The plans are nowr suibmnitted to the meeting, and from thie novelty of itsconstruction af3brding security against a recuyrence of a similar catastrophe, they trust will in the highest degree prove satisfactory. It is proposed that the theatre siould be insulated.-should be so contrived that by the aid of party walls the greater portion of the pro-

"In the construction of tho new building, the committee recommend to thotrustess (to vhom thepropertyts to be nssigned for the benefit of the isew rentem) stone and iron to be used wherever they mun be applied judiciously; the best supply of water obtained the most approved 2ppalruts for extinguishing fire provided, ati

On the subject of securIties. the committee. in conclusion beg to call your attention to these further considerations, that tbe old renters having abandoned their claims as before stated, the new renters will, when thr theatrc is erected, rest then upon en entirely unincumbered property (the aundlerd's daimsexcepted), upon a veryvaluable leaseheldproperty, wshich sill be more amply secured by the insurance to be regulaIly elrected on the buildings, and on all that part of the daily accumni. lat ili progcrey N hkhiswill beseparated from ths body of the theatre stset,mms a ythevalujoftheadjining extensivepremiscs, andby the licencesattached to the theatre, vie, the Englisk Operolicence, the Lord Chamberlain's winter licence for musica perfuniances and rec idtatiens, the proprietor's sharo of the licence of the French plays, and ttemagisrates' licence for music an d dancing and other entcrtainmants of the likekind.

The Earl of CLARExNDO said he bad been most unex-
eetedlycalld upon to propose the first resolution. He came

He was ptrsuaded that the resolution wvould receive the un:nimous assent of the meelting. Inadequate as he fet to do justice to th1e subject in its YariOUs branches, lie could not help offctring a fewr remark-s. In thc first p lacec, the v'ery calamity of the fire of the English Operat House-the extreme and unexpected distress wltieh it occasioned-the circumstance of its pro. prictor being suddenly reduced at raiser an advanced period of life from affluence to penury,-thcse matters all constituted a strong appeal to cvcry British heart. (Hecr, hear.) Air. Arnold was a greatly, and hie would add, justly favoured servant of the pub lie-h had contributed infinitcly to the publicgratification,andhad becninstrumcntal in bringing about extraordinary iiiiprovements in one of the most charming and liberal of the fine arts. This meri. torious public servant had successfully attempted the rc.

Arnold's objec: to place British music oat the highest feoting, aind not to leave this country inferior in tlhat respect to continental natitins. This circumstance gave him a sort of claim upor. national gratitude, which lie trusted would nowv be acknowledged. Be spoke in the presence ot many pcrsons who knevr lIr. Arnold, and lie was sure he would be fully borne out by them when he advcried to timc liberality with which that gentiensan had invariably comle forward to relieve the distrcss of others (hear) * but lie felt it was not necessary to dwell upon that topic. MIr. Arnold's claims to public consideration rested upon the ground of his exertions in the scrvice of the public. (Hear, hcar.) There were two topics whlich the friends of Mllr. Arnold and the patrons oftltc Erglish Opera ought to consider particularlyfirst, the peculiar merit nssd object of tie theatre; and in the next place, tbat if the support now sought for proved diffusive and estensive enough, thic re-establishmcnt of it might be eflected without individual sacriilee; as consequences of which the public would enjoy the gratificattion of seeing a favourite place of amusement revived tupon an improved plan, and Mlr. Arnold might be rcstored to deservd aiffluence by the good opinion of iis countrymen. (Hear, hcar.) The noble earl concluded by moving the following resolutiou:-
ThatIlt is theo pinionofthismeeting that furi Arnold from
his public-spirited and successful Mxertionst paetiuiarly during the last sixyaerb. to imroec tha dramatic music of this countrypby tho
productionaof smeof Un e fines cotapositos of modern cdienc is jstly entitled torthe supportand patronageof every admirer of this deligntful bstach of the tine arts -
SirTA BARUARD seconded the resolution, and observed that Mar. Arold was proceeding saith the full tide of sUCCeSS in his favyour when the unforeseen misforttune, which they were that day assembled to cndeavour to repair, happened to him. Hte wvan justified in assuming that if Mr. Arnold were rcplaced in his former situation, ho would in al probabiity advance aith still better success than before.
Thc resolution was agreed to unanimously.
The iblarqd s of Sa itsnd 3ul aid, ab e wohat had fallen from the noble earl, ho had littic to add, and wrould wiilitily propose the resolution confided to mois care without a single wrord of observation,i ist were not that hE wished to biar tehsitony to the very meritorious exertions of thc gnotlemmn in referener to whost interests they had tasetibled. Tbat individual had been niost successful, not only in administering to the pleasure of the public, but in his dforts to restore a most delightful art, ssllicli, without his exertions, wa5 (as related to English musical composition) falling into decay. It wvas most gratifying to himn also fiurdier to have stts lnisa itoer to lay before the meeting a verypronmising finsncial statement. (Hear.) They had heard, in the report, that a sum of 40,0001. would he neccessary in order to rc-establishm the theatre, and that it was proposed to raise 30,0001. by debentures, for the purpose of enabling Air. Arnold to restose the Eglish Opera Housc, the destruction of which was a heavy calamity not only to him but to the public. The noble marquis hte rcad and commented on the resolution, obseving, that it offcred tcenns sufficently advantageous to induce persons to invest their property in the speculation. He mighit add, that the prospects o Ilr. Arnold, previously to the recent calamity, and the profits which he was reasiing, were of the most satisfactory kind, anud the inference was that, if reinstated in his former situation, the fair expectations of the annuitants would be reaDzed; and that they would not be called upon on a future occasion to relnquish or diminish the amount

(Hear and laughter.) Under all the circumstances of the cas he tl ought M%r. Arnold did niot ask too much when be xskledthema to lend a helping hand on the present occasion. Talking of lnvcestntmnts,hebheHeyed there were wehat were called Ljong Annuities, but which had now become rather abort annuities, and which were re. duced fronm a term of 5() or 60 years to about S0 and yet did not aiford Above 5 or 5h per cent.

that he was surrounded not by mere acquaintances, but by friends. He hoped no timc would be lost, but that theywould sit a good example by subscribing immediately.

(Hear.)
Sir hTV. FREESIASTLE concnrred in the sentiments expretsed by tbe noble lord (Castlercagh.) He cametbere perfectly unacquainted with what was likely to occur, but he must a(dmit he came with the intention of supporting ilr.Arnold, though personally unacquainted with that gcntleman, on the ground of public advantage no less than upon that of Private beneHit. Having heard the able explanations which had been given, nie should follow the example of the noble lord, andp~ut his name down for a share. (Hear.) He did think the present a very great national object (bear), and hte hoped to recommend the undertaking still farther, from the support which it was 'understood to have received from lsrd Lowtherr that, in completing the project, the Conunis.sioners of lVoods a'd Forests wYould lend their assistance to remnoving thu establishment to a situation more advantageous than the former site, an alteration that must add to the prospects of success. (Hear.)
Sir GEORGE CLEar, said it was unnecessary to add much to what had been already stated; but having been on Dir. Amold's committee, and baving looked into the security for the proposed investment, he should aay, that he thought per sons might embark their property in the undertaking with much safety. (Hear.) The old renters had relinquished or postponed their claims, so as to leave the new. subscribers a perfectlv unincumbered security for their advances. It should be recollecte(d that Drr. Arnold had been enabled, almost frqm his own resources and exertions, and with very moderate means, to build a large and extensive theatre on the site of the old Lyceum, and that when the calamity which they all deploredt came upon him, not a single debt (as he believed) resnained due upon account of that establishment. This was suffic.ent to encourage persons 'disposed to encourage tle present undertaking to proceed. He should put his name down for a share. (Hear.)
The noble Cu1AIssIAw stated, that the Duke of Devonshire had written to him to say he should take a share. The noble Duke, when he made this communication, was, of course, not aware of what had taken place to.day, or probably he would have taken mote shares than one.
Ailr. SWEET was so satisfied with the security offered, that he would make this public declaration, that he thought individuals might freely invest thlir money in the undertaking (hear); for his own part he should- take a share. (Hear.) It would be satisfactory to thenmeeting to know that in addition to the 30,0001. to be raised by rent charges, there was likewise a sum of 10,0001. to be applied from other sonces, which would .aflord an additional security to the renter. He hoped a new eite might be fixed on. Tle present occasion ofl*ered an opportunity for onu of the grandest improvements that it was possible to effectin the retropolis-be alluded to the project of opening a new street front Waterloo-bridge north. wards. He hoped the opportunity would be seized-tlhc hops strengly influenced hilm in coming forward, connected at lie w.as with WYaterloo-bridge, the property of which must be greatly improved by such a-measure. (Hear.)
The Earl of CL AREWDNo2 was much obli5ed to Mlr. Sweet for his conduct on this accasion, particulary for his last remark, which showed that whoever was interested in Waterloo-bridge was in tealit- deeply interested in the presesrt schem-e for if a gsffficient sum could be procured to enable Dir. Arnold to remove the theatre from its present site to one mnore desirable, or if that object could be effectedl in anyother way, and a new opening made northward, it would most materially advance the prosperity of the bridge proprietors.
Dir. G. Ronists said, believing that some gentlemen present were anxious to obtain the serntjments of gentlemen in the city on the subject, lie had gone ta,tlhc further end of the room to look for them, and although fie did not find so many city gentlemen there as he could have vished, yet he had discovered one friend of his from that quarter, who would be glad to say something on this occasion, but being like himself (Mlr. Robins) rather diffident (laughter) forbore, and authorized him to put down his name as a subscriber. His friend DMr. Dutrant was the gentleman in question-his example would go a great way in the city, where lie was known not only as a very rapeepable man, but also as a very cautiops man. (A laugh.) Under such circumistances, he vas sure his fiiend Durraut's name woitld be very useful to them in the city. He (Dlr. Robins) would feel great happiness in taLkng a share hiinself. He had (as was well kuown)a greatmany sbates in other the^atrical properties; otherwise he should be disposed to subscribe much more largely in the present case. However- he had been authorized by an anonymous friend of his, who was a well. wisher to the drama, and desired to see Dlr. Arnold's theatre reinstated, to subscribe fbr eight shares. (Hear.) After Isis own name then he should put down his friend Mr. " Anonymous," who wished to remain unknown, but as there wvas a prejudice against anonymous subscribers,,and a fear lest they should never pay theirsubscriptions, he would undertake to remove that difficulty by paving his anonymous friend's contribution. This modest and unknown gentleman hail (as he befbre hinted) authorized hin to subscribe 2,000!. towards the undertaking in the sbape of eigist shares (hebr)); and although he wvould not call upon any body else to follov his aknonymous friend's example, still it was hardly necessary for him to say ho should feel delighted if any one did. (Hear, and lau 'ter.)
The Dllarqiis of SALIsBuRY said ho believed it was hardly necessary for hin to bring tbfvard any additional inducement to persons to subscribe, but ie had just been informed of a fact, with which lie was previously unacquainted, andwhich he thnught did comain such an induenment, because it involved an additional security. The subscribers would havq the additional seourity of' certain property now producing a rent of I .0011. a year, wholly dCetachel froni the theatre. (Hear.)
Dir. BEAZLY obsenred, ihat nothing whicls he could say could reflect more honour on Dir. Arnold's character tsan l-ad already been aseribed to it; but wvhen it was obsered thiat persons in thc service ot'th.t gentlensan cause fbrward to lenid their tdd on trie present occasion, no higlher colipliment could be paid to Dir. Arnold and the justice of the tribute whicrl thc respectability of this meeting itself offered to Isis character was fully confirmed. He hnd been elesired by an olti and faithful servant of Alr. Arnold-Dir. Grove, who liad long acted as prompter at the English Opera House-to put dow-n tis itame for a share. (Hlear.)
It was stated by Dir. lIoness, that the payments on the shares were to be made in five equal instalments, as the work proceeded-she iirst instalment of.501. ashare niot to benclled for till the lease was signed, and the last to be required whet the work was completed.
Mir. MAvYHtEr wished to add to what had been already stated on the subject of security, that the ground-rent of the theatre, if erected on the oldl gite w,ould be abundanitly secured by houses, the rental of?which amounted to nearly 1,2001. a year.
The namnes of subscribers for shares were read. The following wereaamony the number :-The AMarquis of Ailes. bury, two; the Dlhcquis of :Salisbury, two e the Earl-of Cla.ondon, one; Lord Castlereagh, one; Lord Saltotn, oee; Sir I'.

DIr. Ronasrs said, the subscriptiotms nlready amounted to one-third of the entire sum required, andl added, he had no doubt that the subscription would soon bh fall, and the shares at a prensiuni. (Hear, anti laughter.)
On the niotion of the Earl of CLARENDOX, secoaded by ADr. t.

AIORNIA'G, CO.VCERT.
Mr2. Anderson's concert drew a crowded and fashionable 'audicnce to the King's Concert Room yesterday morning. BeRides -two solos on the pianoforte, BIrs. Anlerson per. -formed a duet with Hummel. The piece was Hummel's duet in A ftt,_-lrs. Anderson taking the treble, and Hum. mel the bass. This-did not afford the great German pianist any remark;able opportunity for the display of his extrmordi. nasv skill. His style of playing appear to be peculiarly adapted to what the Germans caU the " strenge style," of which indeed his compositions in a great measure partake. Tho accurate performance of such a composition as the lEt movenient of Hummel's Concerto in A minor, is certainly a test of skill in pianoforte playing: this test Mlra. Anderson presented toeheraudience in a mostsatisfactory way. She also played a.Polonaise by Her, in which she displayed all the nimble and brillant fingerifg for which she is remarkable. The concert was not so good in the vocal as in the instru. mental department, thouqft the program:ne contained the namaes of Mlesdames 3MIens-Ialande, Malibran nnd Stack hausein. Nnadame laande sung a scena by 1Fnccini; bladame Mlalibran Una roce,,and two Spanish songs, the latter accompanied by herself Qit the pianoforte. In one ef them she produced a curious cftnct by striking her knuckles upon the front' board of the instidment, apparently in imitation of the castanets. 12:dame Stockihausen sang a Siiss song, ac. companied on the harp by her husband. In one part it bore a resemblance to the Tyrolian song in GUilasume Tell. The other vocal performers were Signor de Beg. nis and a Mlonsienr Ponebard, who on this occasion made his first appearance is England. He sang twro French songs, one -from the Dame Blanche, and the other fm oi Auber's FiancEe. These colpositions do not demand powers of a high order on the part of the singer; and Al. Ponchard executed them in a very pleading style. The dis_ tinctness of his articulation is partieularly remarkable. ori played with even t'nore than his usual delicacy a delightful fentasia by Mayseder; and Nicholson gave one of his fa. vourite flutecoActrtos.

MORNING CONCERT r.
Y'esterday the celebrated Huiminel zave hiis seconid morning concert at the great room in the King's Theatre. The programme, ac may be supposed, announced an interesting entertainmnent to the lovers of pianoforte playing. Rurnmrl pierformed his grand concerto in A flat, an clegant composition, well calculated to display the peculiar excellencics of his style of playing. To convey an iden of HurAmel's beautiful touch to those who have nothsad the happiness of hearing him woula perhaps be impossible, but wve inay observe tbat it rcsembles that of J. B. Cramer. He possesses in nn erinent degree that elasticity of finger wvhich distinguishcs our own great master, and wshich is totally the reverse of that hammering style into wvhich cvein great pianists are apt to fall, iln their eftorts to produce effect. Hutumel is singularly happy in the art of blending the n,otes one with anothier, so as to obviate the principal deficiency of the pianoforte, vi7-that staccato effect hliicil is so pecularly unsuitable to slow movements. A sonata by Mozart nsas performed as a duct fier two piansfortes by Mlessrs. Afoschteles aniti unimel. This was an extraordinary trial of skill, anid it wotild be difficult to decide to which of the iwo great perform. ers the palh of superiority sionill be jiwarded. But the chief attraction of the concert wezs H!ummel's extemporancous performance, for wvhicil he requxested any of the company to furnish him witl, a writtell theme. This request was repeatedt from ithe orchectra by Sir (. Smart, ,nd two written papers were handed up to Mir. Iluinintl. The first wvas an air, wvhich afterplaying overhe modulated in cliertis in a variety of keys, and thien launched jitto some brilliant and fanciful variaiions; after which he tuti. denly initroduced the well.know nairof the F ren-heded CotvBoy,hich we presum vas the secon s theme presented to himad. Upon thlis latter subject he also performed some exceedini lr tretty variation,, the whole forminig an elegant fantasia, wvhich woulnd have reflected no trifling degree of: credit on the composer, had it been the result of tiehiberate study, fnstcad of the mere off-hand eflusion of thle moment. Among the instrumnetal perforniances of the morning wist a military sep. tetto, a manuscript composition of Hummcl, phaycd by Diessrs. Hummcl, DSori, Lindley, Wilson, Nicholson, iiman, and Harper. It was an admirable cotmposit-on, and wec need scarcely add thlat it wvas aslimirbly performed.

THE LIVERPOOL PESTIVAL.
WED)NESDAY, OCT. 6.
The Liverpool Festival is conducted with the same good taste and public spirit which characterize the public amus~e_ ments of this town. The sacred perlbrnaincies used to be held in a small and inconvenient church in Lord-street, hut are now transferred to the more spacious and commodious one of St Luke. The latter is not yet consecrated, and the internal space, not being at preaent encumbered with pews, bas been fitted up witis temporary seats, all of which commnand the orchestra.Thecvening concerts are lkeld in inampititheatre which has,certasnIy no othcr recommendation than that of capacity. The principl singers are lladame Alalibran, Madaie Stockhausen,Airs. Knyvett, Mlessrs. Braham, Bennett, Knyvett, B.Taylor, Phillps, and Signorde Begnis. Sir George Smart is the conductor and lr. F. Cramier theileader. Thebhand consists of 56 instrumental and 110 vocal performers, and a better disciplined band, take it for all in aU,; we have seldom heard. The scheme exhibits the same leading features as the Norwich one, viz., the "1Last Judgment"1 of Spohr, the "Cruci. fixion" of Graun, the "cSampson " and "Iasracl in Egypt "ofe Han:del, and the "Creation" of Haydn. The first morning's performance was, as at Worcester, merely incidental to the re. gular service of the church, interspersed with a few anthems. The evening concert introduced Al!adamne Malibran in the delightful duet "1Vanne," writh IMadame Stockhausen. It is scarcelypossihle to conceive any thingmoreperfectas tosinging than this duet. Everyinfiection,everygrace, everyomramentis e-xecuted by the twGvojCes3 with such perfect exactness, that it has the effect of an insfrument toucebd by one hand, and moved brone impulse. Mirs. Kuyvett,Messrs. Knyvett, Bennett, ana Phillps, sung aforsley's excellent glee, "1See the Chariot," admirably, but not so "10 guardate." The oinly amusing part of this very amusing quintetto was the imperturbable gravity with which all the singers, De Begnis excepted, went throughi it. AllendeLsohu's sparkling overture to the Mid.suemmer Ali~ght's Dream was very well played, considering the number of country performners in the band. Mlrs. Knyvett sung Purcell's "1Mad Bess" with the excellent taste whichi characterizes her execution of classical English music. The "I,ast Judgment" of Spohr,which produced so strong an impression at the Norwich festival, was performed this morning, and formed the most attractive feature of the scheme. The Liverpool band, though much smnaler than the Norwich one, was quite up to the due execution of this splendid work. A sufficient proof of the great advance of musical taste and knowledge in the provinces lias been afiborded in the performance of an Oratorio So novel in its style and structure, by two separate bands in distant parts of the kingdom. A seodhaighas confirmed our opiniion of its genius and grndur h~ ere is a bold and lofty daring about it, whichi is the true indication of genius, while the colouiring and fillilng up of the splendid ontltine discover the most consummate knowledge of vocal and instrumnental effects. The pri. cipal singers on this second performance appeared to feel more at home in their parts. Braham's solo, "Jehovah now cometh to judgment," was delivered with the mostindeseribable grandeur and effect. Attwood's " Coronation Anithem, " and Bishop's " Battle of the Angels," thoughi rendered familiar to ourears by frequent repetition, have too much intrinsic excellence to exaciteany other feeling than that of admiration; except it be
thtteir authors, whbo fromn their genius and musical attainments are so well qualified to add to our stock, of Sacred music, should have done so little for the servic of the church. Miadame M5alibran's conception and execution of "1Holy, holy," is now perfect. A more frequent intercourse withi English singers has chastened those exuberances whicht marked her first attempts in the sacred school of this country, while it has left untouched those striking maniifestations' of real genius and intense feelig by which her singing is so pee. eminently characterized.

LIVERPOOL MUSICAL FESTIVAL.
FRIDAY, OCT. 8.
The perfornance of "The Mlessiah" yesterday morning at. tracted, as usual, a numerous audience. The absence of' Uis%. Paton from this and the other festivats hasoccasioned adiferensit cast of this oratorio, illrs. Knyvett having succeeded to some' of what are usually regarded as the first songs. If, in some respects, her executson of them wants the power and majesty which has characterized that of her most highly giftcd prcdce cessors, it is never deficient in correct taste, and may bc regarded as the best remaining specimen of the ancient concert stylc of singing. The same circmstance has brought Madame Stockrhausen into notice as a singer oe s3cred music; and it may safely be pronounced her most suc., ce=sful style. In airs which require either great neatness of execution, like " WVith verduire clad," or (to recur to the oraterio more immediately under notice) which demand a simple and touching expression, like "Come unto me," slhe eminently exels. Mlalibran's " Rejoice greatly" was a brilliant display of the volume and flexibility of her extra.: ordinary voice. The other tongs were sung by Brahamz, Knyvete, Phillips, &c., with their accustomed exellsence. The concert of last night was very numerously at.ended. De Beriot's Concerto was the most popular pice of the evening, and It was an exhibition of complete mastery over his instrument. 'c werec again delighted with alibran,'s " Non piu di fiori," and scarcely less 8o with Wtill.. man's accomnpaniment. The Tyrolian quartet and chorus from Gt,iifizenmc Tell werer effectively performecd. The glees "Heire in cool gree," and " The lliidges," wecre dr6crve31y encored.
The selection of this moring was almost exclusively of tbd old school, whicb, with so efficient a band, was rather to be regretted and, considering that Handel had furnished the whole bill of fare fbr She preceding day, it.was giving us ratlier too much of one dish to resort to him for two.thirds of the present one, and that to the total exclusion of Haydn and Beetheven. What little Illozart supplied was exquisite, and rather excited than satisfied our appetite. Mlaster Phillips sung the " Agnus Dei," from his first mass, with excellent taste. In the selection fromi "Sam pson," two of the songs were given with the most perfect finish of which they are sus. ceptib1e-Bralsbai's " Total Eclipse," and Kinyvett's " Return, 0i Gfod oF' hosts." OF' Malibran's " Deh paslate," we can only reiterate our expressions oF unqualified praflise. It receivea the unusual tribute oF' an cncore ins the church. llWc regretted to find the first song from Crotch's " Palestine ' standing alone itn the scheme, instead of forming part of a selection from that masterly composition. lWby is It th2t a work of such consummate genius is never heard (except under the direction of the Oxford professor hini. self) at any of our musical festivals? Graunts " Crndfixion" furned part ef thl morning's performance. Brabam's delivery of the solo "Affrighted Seraphim" was among, hi5 happiest eforts; it may be placed on the same level witni bis " Deeper and deeper still;" and the beautiful alternation of the melody hetween the two voices in " Hark, the kind forgiving word," was perfectly brought out by1Madame Stock-. hausen and Mrs. Knyvett. The magnificent fugue which starts the last chorus was sustained by the band %vith equsl posver and precision. The conduding act containert a very pleasing choras from an oratorio by Kunzen; the selection from " Judas Maccabzeus" calls forno remaurk, as it consisted. merely of those airs and chorusses which every body knows and in the performance of wvhic no extraordinary degree of talent can be exercised.
It is itnpossible to have attended the three festivals of the present year without being struck with the advance of smusi_ cal taste in difrerent parts of the kingdom. The instrimen.
tat band at Liverpool were (excepting the principals) almostexclusively country players; the choral band were all resi. dent of the town and neighbourhood, and nothing could be more correct than tlteir perfomtnance even ofthe most difficult oratorio musir. It is rather humissting to torn to the metro. polis,andfind it so far behind either Norwich or Liverpool in the latter essential. With the first instrurneistal band in the world, we know of no means of giving due effect to the perfbrmance of " The Last Judgment" in London from the want of that nureerous and well-trained chaoms ;bich exisL in the towns we have mentioned. Every other species of musie may be there beard In the highest perfection, but'for that of the noblest and sublimest character we must, at pre. sent, be compeUed to travelinto the country.
It would be an act of injustice to concwae our notice of this festival without giying our unqualified commnendation to the admirable arrangemuents, the exelltnt taste, and consurrnmate skill of Sir George fintUrt.

THE NORFOLK AAND NORWICH MUSICAL
FESTIVrAL.
T fVednesday, Sept. 22. The p-erforrnances began last niAbt with a concert at St.
Anldretvs'a lall. Haydn's sinfonia, Nd. iO, was the first piece, and the number of London perforniers, supported by many excellent provincial players, and forming an instramenntEl band of 120 gave a magnificent effect to this masterly composition. ' God savc the King " was then sung by the principal vocalists, and chorussed by a voc.al band of 230. Each act concluded with a dramatic chorus ; the Ernt with Bishop's
' Tramp chorus," in the commeicement of which the voices werecinelysubdued, and the burst on the forte wasperfectly electrical. The second was from one of 10ozart's operas,adapted (we don'tknow wby) to English words. Madame lalibran's songs, Una voce pocofa," and the " Tyrolen Air," com. posed for her by Hummel, were as vell adapted as any that could have been selected, to display her extraordinary compass end her unrivallcd execution; The duet " Vanne" from the Andronico of AIercadantc, betiveen Mlalibran and Stockhausen, was a finished specimen of vocal. excellence. Wlhit could induce Braham to select " The King! God bless him !" as a concert song? It requires not the aecompani. ment of violins and flutes, but ofbottles and glasses, to give it effect.
The Wednesday moming'a selection began- with an act from the Samson of Handel. A German composer, whose name we have forgotten, published ass edition of tbis oratorio with added accompaniments, which, wve presume, were em. ployed on this occasion. The selection comprised somne of its most strilking fcatures. The chorus of " Fixed in his everlasting est " was truly magnificent; the roll of 65 vocal and 3 0 instrumentaLbasses on the words " His thsiilder roars," wasa strikingdevelopmentofHlandel's gigantic power. The second act was a wreath culled fronm the fatirest flowers of modern cultivation, to which Haydn, iMIozart, Beethoven, Hfummel, Peesielo, and Cimarosa, in turn contributed. The principal features were the " Storm Scene" of Haydn, and the "Sanctus" and "Benedictus"from Hummel's mass in E: flat. The former probably never was heard to-such advan. tage, as its efrct wholly depends upon two zequisites, which are very rarely combined-numerical strength, and individual correctness. Unless these are united, the effect is ridiculous-here it Vwa sublimne. Whatan exquisite air is the "Jesu Domine" of lozart. and how admirably was it sung by Stockhausen. But the mnost perfect vocal exhibition was Mlalibran's "Deh ptrlate." Hopeless is any attempt to convey. an adeqiate idea of the deep and tender feeling which she breathes into this air. Last night she amazed-sbe dele. trifled us, but tears were the appropriate tribute toher simging of thismoing. The third aeopened ith a selection from the"' Crucifixion of Graun." (raun has the same distinct inteligible outline which so pre-eminently marks the compositions of HandeL There is no attempt at elaborate eaects or new combinaitions, but he seems to trust to the individual excellence of his singers, and to the power of his band to give effect to the effbrts of his Kenius. As with Handel, so with Graun, second.rate vocalists, and a mnoderate band, would do nothing. Braham's sigisig in the solo " AfFichted Seraphim," may be classed with ms " Tot.al Eclipse." In both cases the notes are of easy execution, but how few singers are able-to give all the meaning and al the force that lies hidden in those apparently easy- pasages. The chorus "Jesus shall reign" is a fugue on two clear and vocal subjects. The fine atgmen. tation of the first subject towards the conclusion was magnificently brought out by the noble army of basses. We ought not to leave unnoticed the duet in this selection by Alrs. W.

NORWICH MUSICAL FESTIVAL.
- Friday, Sept. 24.
The concerts of last night opened rith the Jupier Sin.
fonfa of Dlozart, to wbich the band did ample ju.stice. It is unnecessary to repeat our commendations of the songs which Madame Il1alibran selected for thlis evening's performance; In Willman's accompaniment of her ANon pin di faoi, it seemed as if he had caught fresh inspiration from her singing. The finale to Fidelio, by Beethoven, dosed the first act. This gigantic production is kindred to theconnlusion of his sinfonia inC sminor: the subjectispresented with such imposing power, and renewedand multiplied with such consummate sk-ill. that it may be classed among the greatest efforts of the author's genius. The selection for this morning began with "1The Dedication of the Temple," by 3slozact. The impressive solo, "Great Israel's God," was well sung. But the great feature of the performance vwas the new oratorio " The last Judgment," by Spohr, a work combining more true genius with riginality than we ever remember to bave heard. Spohr is trained in the school of Beethoven and WeYberx and this composition partakes of what somie would term ist extrava-
ancies ; but it is quite of a new character, and must net be measured by the grave simplicity of Handel, nor the more florid style of Haydn. The subject is one which only a real genius would venture to aPproach, and which does, in fact, allow, and even demand, those extraordinary combinations of which the severer writers of times past would never dream. Our space will not admit a detailed analysis of this extraordinary work, and we maust content ourselves with noticing the solo, in which the approach of "the great day" is announced- the sublime ehorus, beginning with the words "tDestroycd is Babylon the mighty !" and the exquisite quartett and semi-chorus "Blest are the departed." Thieeffectof this scene ismagnificent beyond description, and the extraordinary correctness and point with which it was performed by this mighty band were above all praise. The festival closed with a selection from Handel's " Israel in Egypt," and never was the simple grandeur of his double chorusses more poverfully and accurately developed. The answering choirs were well balanced, and the responding phrases produced, with the support of so large a number of voices, a maagnificent effect.
The hall this morning, as well as last night, was crowded. Among the company we observed the Earls of A]bemarlc and Orford, Lord Suffield Lord Cailtlorpe Sir IV. Folkes, DI.P., Robert Grant, Esq.; 3.IIL, Sir SY. &;euchamp, and must of the resident nobility and gentry. A large namber of strangers also, from most parts of the kingdom, were attracted by the high reputAtion of the Norwich I cstival. Dlr. Cokke was absent. Ve believe it is an understood thing in Norfolk that where (as in the present case) a member of the lVodehouse family stands at the head of any public institution, there Mlr. Coke's support is not to be reckoned upon.
The festival is one of the public efforts of the county of Norfolk of which it may well be proud. Its band is secocad in numerical strength, but second only, to York, and in discipline very far its superlor. The sacred selections at York are deformed by the insertion of very second-rate and trifling compositions. At Norwich they are entirely free from every blemish of this kind; and whether we regard the music chosen, the magnificent effect of the band, the admirable regularity which pervades every department, and the consummate skill with which the whole was corntrolled and guided by the conductor, the Festival of this city stands first in excellence.

The selections oii this oecaalon for the dlsplay of his progress as,a viapnoforte performer, werc numerous and various.

His powersoaof execution and his musical genlus were mare particularly caled into ice,on in the extempore performancelast-mentiened. 3Ur. Field, the composer (of Russian celebrity), -wrote the subject, with a pencil only a few minutes before he tendered it to Master Aspul and a group of musical ladies and gentlemen read it preylous to its delivery. It was a'theme, susceptbie of variations, of eight bans in each part, half common time. Master Arspul commenced without hesitati6th a very clever introduction, at the end of which the subject was entered into in a very masterly manner. Afrer modulating for some time, and reproducing the subject in a variety of keys, he added some very spirited variationus which were closed by a coda of great brillianc, and so strictly adapted to the leading meloldr, thatfit'almost appeared impossible that his ideas should not bave been duly prepared fbf the task. blaster Aspull was very greatly and very deservedly applauded in this as well as in his ether performances.

PAGAArIANrS CONCNLCT.
This performance, respecting which public curiosity has been so highly excited, took place yesterday evening at the King s Theatre. The chilef, or rather the sole, interest of the concert centred in Paganini hi.nselt; the artists enigaged, and the niusic selected, witI the exception of hig comnpositions and performance, comprising no novelty, nor any thling beyond the attractin of an orlinary concert. Pagk. nini executed tbree pieces. The first was a coocerto of tbree movemenus,described in his own progamme-an Allegro Afqes. toso, an Adagio Apparrian'sto, and a Rondo b,i/aeIkn; The sccond piece was a Sonata mititair, performned whelly on tihe first. string. These two pieces had the accompaniment ef the orchestra. The third tihee was as solo1 3n air with va. riations on the hthene ef "Nnn piu Andrai,?' from MOZart's
Nothing can be more diicult than to describe Paganini's perrormance on the violin, so as to make the effect of it intelligible to those wbo have never heard hitn. Hence, and it is but justice to say so much of this extra. ordinary rmsi, all the anticiya'ions formred of him; how. ever highly coloured, have fallen short of the reality. Rel is not only the finest player perhaps that has 'eer existed on that instrament, but be forms a class by him3eIF and preduces effects which he ,lias been the first to dis. cover, and in which fevw, if any, imitators will be able to foUow him. The difficulty and cI mplexity of the passages played by Paganini are tTuly wondetful, aid the ease with which be conquers them is perfe&r. They do not, howevcr, form that which is most to be admired in him- His genius is displayed in a far greater degice inhis slOwrnoemenLs,iiwhich he develops, as it may-without exaggeration.be taid, ciery shade and gradation otfieeling.E His violin in suchi passages seems to be apart of htmaclt; and to becolne that medium in which lie can best portray the workings-of his mind. lf the instrument could be said to speak and to feel, it does so in his klands.; The. deliczcy and truth of his intonation arein all cases conspicuouii- The note, attenuated almost to a thread,is still heard as distinctly as when he drawss torth tbe whole power of the instrument.
The most refnarkable parts of Paganini'6 mechanism are, his use, of notes produced byhtbe fingers or the left hand, simultaneously with those produced by the bow
and his harmonic notes, which are made by the slightest possible pressure-of the string, and,resemblej, trom their clearoae
and sweetness, - the very high notts of the flute. Tbe formsL. tion of these latter is familiar to a certain- extent to all musiclans, but they seldom or ever travel out ofthe common chord. Paganini, however,,giveslong anddifficult Passages, double notes, and even shakes, in this medium. He changes also with rapidity from the harmonic -to the commoi passases, withoutany sensible break in the rytbm. By the use of the pizzicato at the same time with the bowed notes, he may be said to combine the violin and the guitar- in the same instrunent. Thete is more of tprck -nd Miere dexterity in this than in any other part of hbis performance, and it is that or whchwe should be disposed toplacetbelcaitvalae4ough it appears to have excited the mosat wonder. His arprggos are given with a neatness and. predsion: which Is altoge_ -ther without paralleL Hiis execution oF double shakes and octave passages is bighly-&beautll- The latter are given with such perfect intonation, 'tbat tkey appear, unlessone listens with extreme attetitlon, to be the same note. Paganini does the staccato in a manner quite different from all other performers. He strikes his bow once on the string and it seems to run by a tremulous totlon overas many notes as he chooses to include in the rta ccaiOpassage. Thir, too, he does with the quickness almost of-thought itself. His manner of strikinv chords twas quite peculiar. He always used either end' of Itbi 'bow for~ that yurpose, and in such a way that before it toucbed the 8truigs one might haTe thought that the effect -must be- deridedly bad, instead of being, as it' was, perfect. 'The personal appearance of Paganini is remarkable. He is a tall thin man, with features rather emaciated, pale complexion, a sharp aquiline nose, and a keen eye, the - expression of which is greatly heightened when he is animated by bis perfoinlance. Bis hair, which is dark, is wom' long behind? and comled olf his forehead and temples in a manner thatgives an air of great simplicity to his countennace. He seems tobe about50 years of age. Thereisa singularity in biamanner, whicb, though partaking of the grotesque, dcnotes, a man of no-ordinary stamp, and- rivets attention in a very extraordinary degree. .This interest which he excited was a good deal increased by his appearing to be in a very weak state of health. Indeed, up to a late hour in the day, it wis doubtfiul, we understand, whether he would be able to perform; and his appearance ial
together is said to hare been contrary to the judgment of his medical advisers.
The enthuslasm which his prrformances excited last night among the audience, certainly surpasseel any thing of the kihd within these walls. Every tour deforce and striking passage was not only applauded but cheered by the whole audience,
and some of the variatiosis were encored. At the end of every - performance, and especially after the last, theapplause, cbeers, and waving of handkerchiefs and bats, altogetherpreaeated-a most extraordinary scene.
On-the whole, the reception experienced by Paganlini3laset night musuf have convinced him that the opposition encountered to the scandalous attempt to double the prices, injwblch it is very probable he himself had no share, did iot-;ariae from any gprejudice ngaist this distinguished artist, or the ability to appreciate his performance galt deserves. Fore:gners
whe have been present at his ConCertS in several other psr,s Of Europe,- redarked that the applause bestowed and tob cntheu siasm edeted last night, was greter than they bad evcr wit. nested befiore.
The grouping on the stage wrhen waganini played his concluding piece was extremely striking. Allthe veterasm of the orcbestra, Spagnoletti, Dragonenti Lindley, and theu, had placed themselves so as to watch hsis performnance to the best advantage, and they marked strongly by their countenances the lively impression it made upon them. They were pot the lrastferventin'theirapplause ofwhat theyef' coarse were the beat able to formo ajudgrnent.-
There were some veesl performances during the intervals of Paganini's playing,by MIIadame Lalande,iMdemoiselle Beck, Curioni, Lablache, and Sartini.
The pit and gallery were crowded at an erly hour. The boxes were nst well filled.

P.AGANmNPS fONG-ERT.
Paganlni's performance on the violin Is a novelty In rt so rare and curioes, that it is Well worth recurring to. It may be maid to form a new era in the history of mutic, and to have so fir extended its bounds as to amount to a species of revolution in the most cechanting of the sciences. The violin in his hands is a newvlnstrument; its original powers and supposed extent, even as displayed by the most eminent proressors, are more than doubl ed under the toueh of Paganini. What resources, what infinite combinations, will le presented to the Mozarts and Beethovens of a future age, hobuld the violin ever be cultivated generally to any thing like the stonishing degree that It has been by him.
Psaganiniplays only music of bis own coniposition, but tbis is matter of necessity. No composper could bave produced Tnusic, the execution of which, til Paganini appeared, would have been pronounced impossible. Bis works are, however, distinguished, not.merely by mecbanical dililcultles, but rank very high as corposition. Many of them are published, and arc well known, the existence of them at least, to musicians. They have passed; however, except by those who have heard him slay, as a delusion,-an utter impracticability. The most skilful violinists have declared, that so far from being able to execute them, they could not even Imagine how they could be played. We allude more particularly to bis capriclos, which are in the possession of every professor of the lnstrumtnt, and must have produced despair in the breast of many an aspiring student, at beilng baffled in all the e*orts to sur. mount their inconceivable diffculdties
It is hlghly necessary, we conceive, to do away with one PIcc of injusice which it is very common to hear committed a instPaganini. There is not the least degree, not a tittle oibarlatanism or trick about him. By the term " trick" in vlin playing is meant something which appears difficult, b which ceases to be so when the mode of producing the e ct Is explained. Those who decry Paganini on thbs g und-for we regret to say tkere is more envy and malice to be met with In the science of harmony than in any ofher,would not, perhaps, fiad those difficulties much lessened If they were placed as pupils under the professor himself. The " tricks" of- Papanini are all at essential part of the splendid effects he briags forth. No true muican would part with one of them. But even uncultivated ears, we suspect, will find a grcat charm In Pags. nini: he cannotbe appreciated so weS bIttitIsagreat erfir to imagine that he can be appreciated by musicians alone. All his difficulties are beauties, and beautif4l often in propor. tion to the difficulty. Dr. Johnson once said, when pestered with remarks about the difficulty of a violin concerto. that he wished it had been impossible. This applies justly eiough to most of the mere fiddling passages our ears have been traiaed to endure in public, but the unmusical lexicographer himself would neyer have thought of applying the observation to Pag anii.
It seems almost hyperbolical to say It, but the fact is so, th at Pagauini's playing isin a very high degree intellectual. It Is mental as well as physical, and mechanical. The Instant lie sels hisvioltn, which h6usually coquetawithfor a timebefore bringing it up to its proper place, a sudden animation pase
over his countenance, before cold and inexpressive. He has the advantage, which all concerto players by the way ought to adopt, of never nsing a book. Thismode in Itselfhs
much the superiority as a speech deiivertd has over one that is read. When the first bow Js drawn, Paganinl Is evidently lost to every other thought, and is revelliag probably in a world cf his own c reation. Al his passages seem fiee and unpremeditated, as if conceived on the Instant. One his no impression of their having cost him either forethought or la-
our The word difficulty has no place In his vocabulary, so completely is all brought under his subjection and mastery.
Nothing can Ibe mote intense in feeling than his conception and delivery of an adagio passage. His tone Is not, perhaps, so faU and round as that of some other players-ss Ballot or De -Beriot, for example: It Is delicate, rather than strong; but that delicacy is inconcelvable unless one has heard it, and was probably never possessed equaBy by any other player. His touch is occasionally so fine, that the note seems to float In the air, and not to spring from any instrunent. In point of expression, it is Impossible to imagine any thingmoreperfect. Themelancholy,ortender, asshould be the case in slow movements, mostly predorminate, but there is no shade or form of expression which the genius of Pags. alni does not draw forlt. His adagios are intermixed wIth passages of rspid execution wbich go off with the rapidity of
rocket or a flling star-a, break of the subject, or an inpertinence in any handabut his own-but If antlysed, all is in perftet keeping.
The only thing tha,t can be aid to lessen the wonder of Pganini's powers in the way of mere mechanism is, hat he is indebted for them in sommeasure to his own peeuliar conformation. His long arms and slender frame allow bimr to place the instrument in the most advantageous poition that is possible, and his left arm Is brought so completely under It, tbat his hand seems to cover the whole extent of the finger-board. Such Is the tlexibilitr, besides, of bis joints, that he can throw his thumb nearly back upon bis wrist, and extendI bis little finger, at the same time, in the opposite direction. By these mneans, when In the first position, as it is called, of the violin, he can reacb, without shifting, to the second octave. His extreme high notes,-for he contrives to play tbreeoctrves on each string,-
e en consequently, with a precision and certainty never hesrd=betore. ITnisflexibility, without doubt, is indispensable to the execution of many of the passages, though It Is, proba bly, not wholly Batural to him but acquired, in part, by 'his long and severe practice. hi solo on the fourtb, or 'rf string, the other three being discarned for the occa-
won, we consider among the mnost charming, as well as 'the most wonderful, specimens. There are few players, we apprehend who, In point of mere difficulty, could do on four strings what Paganlni does en one ; but that Is nothing. The charm lies in the peculiar effect-in the soft and si3verj tone of thatxtting, which one almost Imagines to beincrea'ec
though, perhaps, without reason, by taking the others away. No defect is felt as regards comnpass in this plece. There ap. pwar to be as many notessaz in the violin in its ordinary state; and, in fact, by the aid of theharmonics, le does.nmakenearly as many.
For the sake of musicians who have nelther heard PaRanini nor seen his compositions, we notice a few of those ef. i`ccs, which are wholly, or for the most part, peculiar to himself.
1. A succession of chords, in thirds, sixths, and octaves, in plain rythm, and In semi-tones, in the quickest measuie, over the whole extent of the Instrument.
2. A series of shakes on two notes at the same time, thirds, sixths, or octaves. The latter is imnpractlfeble perbaps but with a hand as flexible as that of Paganini. He also makes a double shake on the same note, but produced on different stringe.
3. A complete scale In harmonic notes, which he forms double, and even executes double shakes in them. We be. lieve there are veryfew,even among musicians,who understand the mode by which this peculiar enfect is produced.
4. A continued shake on one note, with wbich he unites chromatic passages over the whole exteat of the instrumnent.
5. His combination of the legato or bowed notes, with the nizzicato, or notes produced by thefingers only. Vith tkese ieforms an accompanimentin doubleortreble notes,sustaining
rich and full melody the while with the bow. He sometimes aries the form of the pizxicato, by passages altemately pro. laced by the finger and tbe bow, and by making sbakes with he finger alone, unassisted by the bow.
Tbese, perhaps, will suffice for this purpose ; It would be !ndless to enter into all the minutlte of Paganini's skill. To udge of him properly, he must be heatd. He is the greatest nusical wonder, without question, of this or any previous age. We subjoin a notice by one of the first musical amateurs of he age (Mr. Gardner, of Leicester, the author of the Lives of Ufaydx and Mozart, and of the Oratorio of Judah), who was resent at Paganinil8 concert. Mr. Gardner says-
" At the hazard of my ribs I placed myself at the Opera loor two hours and a half before the concert began: presently he crowd of musicians and volinists filled the Colonnade to ufficatdon, all anxious to get the front seat,because they had :o pay for their places, Paganini not giving a single ticket iway. The concert opened with Beethoven's SecondSinfony, idmira'ly perfoirmed by the Philharmonic band; after which ablache sung Large al Faotottrm vrith much applause, and ras encoed.

The authonty above referred to-that is, rumour-says that the treatybehtween them2aissgned to Paganini two-'thirds of the gross receipts of the.the-. 'atre, and thereainainiDg third.to Laporte,'out of wihich the whole of thie expenses were to he defryqd. 'If the wonder, ilierefore, had drawn a full -house, theprofits for that single night would have been, 'according to a calculation which-has been made, 2,5001. to-Paganini, and a clear 1,0001. to Laporte, for the expenses of such an'e'vening could scarcely have exceeded the odd250Z.! Assuredly, if tbis dream could have be'e'i realized on the part of the twe -professors, they. have come to the coiclusion that the El Dorido obf. Candide was no exaggeration, and,- that they were the discoverers of the happy country. Tbis point Swas well adverted to by our correspondent of yesterday, but the facts are so striking that they will bear repetition, and they juctify.suspicion, at least, that the manager:gave no unwilling assent to the scheme of the double charge. Paganini having frequently reeeived on the ce'ntinent the coinpliment of double prices, natioially expected the same thing here, without making much inquiry, perhaps, wbat those prices were, or about the actual produce of 'that thdatre &when coimn pletelv filled. H-ewasprobably,also,never informed how I unustl it is to appropriate thewwhole of that theatre
to a concert merely,andwhat uncommon attraction :was requisite to fill it, even at the ordinary prices. It is;but courtesy tola foreigner, and a man of 'eminent 'professaonal talent, as Paganini undoubtedly-is, to state these i ireuiistances on his behalf,; and it is the nipi: nGcessary to do so- as he may, ten to one, unlessiil eiads the Englishlournals fvith the sarne'avidity-with which he appears to have-read the French journals, be kept in total ignorance'itbat the termsof his concert-are regard-
ed every where by high andlow as a scandalous impo- l sition. It is, however, of no great importance where the blame is to fall: it is sure to be visited,: if. persevered in, by its. appropriate punishment of empty benches.
.We have reason to kijow, tbat the talnt of Paganini is-to be appreciated only in a very Darrow circle,-the professors and amateur prrformers on his own instrument, the violin,-aud to the greater part of them the price demanded for the gratificaton of their cariosity is far too great. At to the fashionable world in general, what do they understand or care about the-matter ? -Besides, after all, iaeredmechauical skill is but a secondrate acquirement,andbyno means entitled to the homage I which belosgs to genius and intellect. 'The greatest
instrhmental performers, lke the best dancers and the best tumblers, exhilbit as much of their peculiar talent in' almost infatyears, as they do in the more advanced periods of life: but what minor ever wrote a poem like the Paradise L,osit or a tragedy like Lear ?
Since this was written, we learn by our report from the Iinges Theatre, that Paganini has deemed it necessary to postpone his concert. In point of fact, we believe that not above 8 or 10 boxes were engaged, and those at a price considerably below the enormous price demanded in the advertisemefit.

SIG.VOR PAGANWII'S CONCERT.
Last night Papgnini made his reappesance iq Londor, and gave the first of a scries cfconcet at Covent.&arden Theatre. He performed frt an Ailegro faesi!oso,oflus own compositfon, which we do not recollect to have heard on his first visit to this country. It included a l his difficulties and ronders, hramonics and enhtrmonics, pizzicato in conjunc. tion with bowinFg &c. But still it apeared far less extraor. dinary, and certam]y less pleaslng,- thnn his varations on the xtreghe with which the ncert concluded. This we cenceive to b: the triumph of Paganini's genius, both as a composer and player. The air Js, we believe, tak-cn from an opere by Su"iemaysur, caled La IN'oce di Benevreto, and is the dance of the witches under the walnut-tree. Out of this subject a wondecful piece of musical description is produced by the magical bow af Paganini. The wailing and trembling voices of the old witches are heard in quaint and abrupt mu13ations, and the snme p-ssages be:ng recovered in haijlonics, appesr to represtnt the graceful motions of more dry spirits At the conclusiou of this pieealod cry of ; re was raised, upon which Paganini mm iately stepped forward, and repeated. the intoductory movement. .At the commencement of the 2d part, the overture 0 tne Freyschutz was performed;, and according tocustt31 wvs encored.

A selection of Sacred Music was performed yesterday in this andent church, to aid the funids now collecting for the restoration of the Lady Chapel, and the altar screen. The sum still required, we understand, is about 1,0001., there having been already raised by the liberality of the public more th.n 3 000? Towards the required anmount, the concert of ye'sterday must, we should suppose, hare contributed in a respectable degree, as the attendance was numerous and billiant, consisting principally of ladies. Indeed, nearly as many persons -were present as the church is capable of conveniently accommodating. The performances w.ere such as to give general satisfaction, the singing excelleut, and the accompaniments in a corresponding style. After the overture, and a hymn written for the occasion Mr. Phillips gave " Ye Guardian Saints" (Palestine), wvith considerable effect. Madame Stockhausen sung twvo pieces, one in the first and another in the second part, " 0 Salutaris" and " Gratias agimus," with that purity aad sweetness for which she is so remarkable. "' Deeper and deeper still," was executed by Brahain wuith great power, as also wvere " Luther's hym.n," and the air " Olh liberty," notwithstanding the miserable words attached to it. Age seems to have very little impaired the large volume of his voice, or its manly melody Of the various pieces assigned to Miiss Shirrff " Let the bright Serapliim" seemed to Us the most efiective, but she acquitted herself admirably in all. She was accompanied in " Tle bright Seraphim" by iUr. Harper, wvith a fine trumpet obligato. Alrs. Knvvett, besides bearing a part in some quartets, sung "0 worse than death," and "With verdure clad," in excellent taste. The performances concluded with " God save the King;" after whi6h Mr. T.

Mr. J. B. Sale's annual concert took place on Saturday norning at the Hanover-square-rooms, and was honoured by the presence of their Royal Highnesses the Duchess of Kent and the Princess Victoria. Precisely at 2 o'clock, the houir appointed for the commencemnent of the concert, their Roval Highnesqes entered, and the performance commnenced with "(od save the King." The concert consisted of a judicious mclangeof English and foreign compositions. Several of llan. del's songs were delightfully sung byMlrs.Knyvett, liss SIcphenmand Mr. Brahanm. .Mrs. Knyvett's " Angels ever bright and air" was a specimen of faultless vocal exectttion, and we might justly award the same praise to Mtiss Stepliens's
'Hus , 3yc pretty vtarbling choir," aind Braham's " 11'aft ier angels," btt for the conmnon-place cadences and leng shakes with which they closed their sonigs. These two singers have acquired some bad habits by the long practice of singing at the theatres, where interpolations similar to those of which we now complain never fail to draw down thunders of applause, but such absurdities ouaht not to be transferred to the concert-room. For pure taste and chaste execution in the performrance of Handel's music, our English singers cannot study a better model than Mrs. Knyvemt. In the course of the morninlg some fine glees were sung by Mlessrs. Knyvett, Vaughan, anti Sale. The other vocal performers were ladame Tosi, Mliss Lloyd, Donueili, Lablache, hMr. Phillips, &c. The h2strumenta pieces and clorusses were splendidlyperformed, the latter bein- assisted by the youmg gentlemen of His Majesty's Chapel, iVestminster-abbeN5 &c. On their entrance and departure, the Duchess of Kent and Princess Victoria etirtsled to the audience, four-fifths of which consisted of ladies. The room wvas exceedingly crowded.
Thethird ofthe "City Amateur Conerts," vhich tooltplacc on Friday last, was decidedly the best of the season, both in its instrusnental and vocal departments. It opened vith Beethoven's symphony in D, which was executed with beautiful precision, and well supported throughout. The vocal part of the entertainmuent was sustained by Signora Tosi and Signori DonzeUi and Lablache. Donzelli sung "11 mio tesoro," an air well calculated for the displav of his rich and powerful tones. It was executed with great taste, and elicited a spontaneous call for its repetition. DabLnche appeared to be Labouring under indisposition. A trio between M lori, Lindley, and Dragonetti, composed by Martini, wvas remarkably well executed, as was likewise a solo by Mori. In the course of the evening the overtures to Oberon and La Clemeneze di Tieo were performed.

The second performance took place at Exeter Hall last night. The room was crowded to Sa absolute oveflow, every seat was occupied, and It was vith difficulty that standingroom could be obtained. A very senalblo Improvement has taken place In theta conCerts, both In the vocal and Instru. mental performances. Those discrepances whlch at the first rehearsal offended the ear, and which werc partly to be percelved at the tirst performance, were last night not perceptible. The Improvement In the performance Is no doubt to be attrlbuted to tho perfomiere hailng become better acquainted with each other and with their respective parte, and to the skill and attention of Air. Holdernetts, the conductor. This gentleman has at length accomptlehed the very dtifcult task of drilling into harmony of performance a pgreter number of musicians than have been perhaps cloUected together on any tormer occasion, and of redutcing the performance of amateurs to the precision o1 professional men. The concert of last night reflects the highest credlt on aDllho were engaged In 1t,=nd we are happy to observe, from the throng of company which was present, that the pubilc are becoming more interested In the en. couraxzement of so delightful and rational an entertainment. Mr. Phillips, in the recitative "R3phael," from Haydn's Creation, sang, If possible, better than on the preceding evening. Thechorus IAnd the spirit of God" was pecuilarly grand; the sound of almost innumnerable voices, and the aSc corupaniment of almost innumerable Instruments, produced in this beautiful thorna an effect magnificent beyond conceplion, and absolutely electrified the audience. MI&s C. Novello, thaugh not eo succesaful In" Hai,holy light," was admirable In the air, Gabriel, "The marvellous work behold amazed," and was recelved by the company In a manner that did honour to her excelence and to thtir good taste.

The latter lhdy, In the "Gradas agimus," was accompanied by Mr. Wlllmsa, whose clarinet obligato, though nn excellent thing of the kind, did not appear to us to be at all in keeping with the words or spirit of the olo. But the best morceau of the whole evening wass the air, by Mr. Saplo, "0 liberty ! thou choicest treasure," with the violoncello obigato byL4dley. It was. teceled with the most entlusiastIc appluse from every part of the room-an applause hich lasted eeveral minutes, and which did not eubside tntil the gentlemen on whose performances it was bestowed repeated, which iR, we believe, contrzry to received practice In concerts of sacred musIc, the air and the accompaniment whicl had pro. duced the unanlmous encore. It may be secen, from what we have said, that these concerts Improve as they proceed, and that practice and public support will form good musi. clans, and reward the pains ofthose wh2 contribute, either by their pains, their patronage, or their purses, to the cultivation of correct taste and radonal enjoyment.

The second concert ofthis socicty, Son to obtain, we presumc, under the .peCal patronage of His Majesty, the added epithet of " Royal," was gices last night, with an obvious Improvemcnt on the first concert It opened with Att. wood's anthcem, wrsitten for the corontttion of the present
itng, which Is well I nown as a fiavocrable specimen of this excellcat compo.ser. Its most stril;ing feature is the art vith which he has interwoven the alr of "Rule Britannla" with his main subjecL lYe could hare wished, however, a better performancc of it. An overture, AlIS.

Illmss Bruce then stng witb great effect, a charming canzonet, " In radiant lovelIness," by IV. S. Bennctt, a young composer of gerius, who has found out, in this instance, the value of tho alliance of music with good poctry. A scene from the Afoun. tain Syop?, by Mr. Mlorley a-d chorus, was then given witn much spirit; and was succeeded by AV. S. Bennett's concerto for the pisnoforte in B flat, vwhich he played at the Academy concerts, and ie In every way a masterplece. All the movements ate good, but the slow movement pazticularly eo. He has given abundant employ'nCt to the orchestra, and they did him justice; to say which Is great praise. In the fiary glee, " Over hUl, over dale," by T. V. Chubb there were clever pass3ges, but the singers barely gave it ihe chance of success It deserved. The first act conc'uded with a dramatc overture by J. B. Tutton, the work evidently of a good mu.
idcan, but in too anmbitious a style.
A symphony by J. H. (eriesbach led the way In the second set, a very ingeanious performancet but unmercifully long. Of Haydn, whom hr seems to have studied with c2rce he might have learned one nrt more, whicth is that of never exhatustinz his subject, or tiring his audlence. This is a " rock. n'-head" to most young conmroserm In vocal music ir. GOresbach does not succeed so well, or perhRps the specimens given in this act from an oratorio of his on the subject of Brlsha=zar'i Feast are not of llis bhet style. Attwooed's trio, " Qual silcozie," could not be understood, owing to a very defective performance of it. Alirs. Gesin sang the air " Say, could I live," from the Mfonntain Sylph, very chastely and expressively; and a theme with variations, composcd by Blagrove, a young Acaderocan, svas playcd by J. Banister on the violin, with much commard of the Instrument and a good tone. The last plece In the programme was an overture bjr G. A. lacfareen, a young compoTer who, if praise does not spoil him, is Ukely to tdke rnk among those who do honour to " native talent."
On this occasion the band was led by Alr. Dando with
t steadinte and firtness; and the concert was under the rmcdtion of Mr. Jaraes CalkIn. Each piece was conducted by the composer, and all received in tmirn a most cordial reception from the audience, which was very numerous.

I lMiSS CHAMl;BERS*S CONCERT.
The conceit of this s oung lhdy was given last night in the gret room at the Albion Tavern. Notwithstanding the very unfaotmrable state of hc weather, and the excitement of pnlitis oan the first day oT the meeting of Psrliament. the room was crowded with comipany of the first respectabliity. Scveral vocal professors of high reputation, whose narnes were announced in the programmc, from some cause or other, were no, present, but their absence was the less to be rcgretted because there was quite suffcient talent secured to render the success of the amusements a certainty. Mliss Clara Novello was amongst the number of thosc wLo uflfered from the usual epidemic-cold, which so frequently sttacks both great and little singers on concert nights, and on benefit nights at the theatres. . Miss Chamb-ra herself, though evidently indisposed, performed her part most creditably, and was raptunously received by her friends. 31r. Parry, in the air " Bendemcer's Stream" (Lord Burghersh), in which he accompanied himself on the harp, was deseredly encored. Mrs. Seguin, Miss Ostergard, and Mliss Friedmann also contributed their share to the gencral stock of entertainment. It must not, howevcr, be forgotten to mention, whilst pra.sing generally, the very particular mnerit of Mlliss Robson, who on this occasion made her first appearance in public. This roung lady possesses not merely the mchfanism of the art and mere compass of voice, but taste and judgment. It is tobe regretted that at this and at similar concerts so many Italian airs are introduced, and so few English ones. It is to be suspected that they are sometimes introduced for the purpose of concealing ignorance, by investing them in something that is not compreiendui, in the samne way that bad penmanship :s sometimes madc use of to conceal bad speMling, or to convey a not-on of importance and difficulty, under the notion of Omne ignoourn pro magniftco.

mong more books for boys we have Old Gold, or the Cruise or the Jason (Nister), in which Mr. Manville Fenn is at his best. An exploring party goes up the Amazon, and several of the characters are capital—the skipper, his mates, and the sundried American who has pre-eminently the push and pluck of his compatriots. The story is packed full of startling incidents ; the Indians make things unpleasantly warm, and perhaps there is an improbable superabundance of sensational experiences in the zoological department. In Far Bolivia, by Dr. Gordon Stables (Blackie), takes us once again to the head waters of the mighty Amazon. We like it better than most of Dr. Stables’s stories, because he is less Scottish and more cosmopolitan than usual. There is a fair plot with picturesque sketches of tropical scenes. Allan Adair (R. T. 8.), is by the same writer ; Allan, as usual, being a Scot, and taking his departure from Tayside. He sees the world with a vengeance, circumnavigating the globe, and having a succession of
miraculous escapes from death in all conceivable forms. Won from the Waves (Griffith, Farran) is by the late Mr. Kingston, but we have not met with it before, nor are we told that it is a new edition. Anyhow it is a capital story, breezy with the breath of the ocean wave, and full of fighting at sea and on shore. The scenes are laid in the period when Earl Howe was the hero of the day, and with heroes of all ranks there are villains galore. Besides there are two pretty love stories, where the lovers are tossed on the billows of fate till drifted into port. In In the King’s Service, by Captain Brereton (Blackie), are chapters ot sensational Irish history, describing the storming of Drogheda and Cromwell’s thoroughgoing methods from the point of view of a young Royalist who pushed the Protector’s lieutenants hard. A Trek and a Laager and Early Days Among the Boers are two stories of
South African adventure, in periods long before the latest trouble with the Boers. The former, by Jane Speltague (Blackie), narrates the fortunes of a venturesome pioneer family, who fell upon evil times between wild beasts and ferocious Kaffirs. It is pleasant, lively, and instructive. “ Early Days” (Griffith, Farran) is by the veteran General Drayson, an authority on South African matters. It takes us back to the time when Cetewayo was beginning to makehimself obnoxious; whereas Mr. Johnston's One of Buller’s Horse (Nelson) brings us down to the campaign when Cetewayo tempted Providence and won a victory only to be crushed. For God and the King (Bousfleld) is a good collection of “ True Stories of Heroic Women,” by Sir Edward Creasy, Lady Fanshawe, and other writers. They go back to the days of the Heptarchy, and the more modern heroines range from Jeanne d’Arc to the Maid of Saragossa.

Dr. Dugald Mitchell’s object in writing a History oe the Highlands (Alexander Gardner) has been to provide a history “ of moderate length.” A public debauched by primers and manuals will regard a book of about 700 closely printed pages as immoderately long. Highland history is very complex, and as up to the 16th century its records were mainly to be found in oral tradition, or in ill-informed Lowland authors, Highland history is very obscure. Dr. Mitchell is copious, industrious, conscientious, and, to an almost startling degree, impartial. We have compared his book with many other records of the same events, and can pronounce the work interesting and useful, though tocking in condensation and devoid of charm of style. The book should be in every Highland lodge, not that sportsmen read history, but because it- might often be found useful for references to the local affairs of the strath or glen.

NEW FRENCH BOOKS.
(FROM OUR PARIS CORRESPONDENT.)
I would once more call the attention of English readers of French books to a few of tee more remarkable of recent publications. M. Maurice Fannon, whose unlucky accident in the final day of tee Paris-Berlin nice deprived him, perhaps, of occupying the second place in teismateh, has just proved in a singularly fascinating volume,entitled “ Troig mills Kilometres en Ballon ” (Signol), that he is as daring and experienced an explorer of tee air as ho is a master automobilist. The illustrations which accompany this volume are often from photographs of tee earth’s surface as seen from tho balloon and are curiously interesting. There are seven chapters dealing with
as many picturesque journeys in mid-air, during which physiographic observations of every sort were taken. The layman will be less amused by M. Maurice Gaget’s remarkable monograph on “ La Navigation Sous-marino ” (Beranger), but he will do well to take up the book if it be only to peruse the last chapters, in which, after" technical explanations of the various types of submarine vessels, M. Gaget discusses how far tee theories of modern naval warfare will have to be reconsidered by our naval strategists owing to the r6le ot tee submarine vessel. I cannot too much insist on tee Buggestiveness for naval specialists of tee chapter on “ Privateering and grande guerre,” or of tho last two, in which tee problem of a FrancoEnglish war is treated from tho *point of view of the efficacy and utility of the submarine vessel. In another order of ideas let me note the appearance of a curious journal in two volumes, written from 1775 to 1780 by the French Charge d’Affaires in Russia, M. de Corberon, " Un Diplomats Franqais 1 la Cour de Catherine H.” (Pion). Tho picture of Catherine’s Court as given hers is remarkably detailed and frequently piquant. A valuable introduction of nearly 75 pages is contributed by M. Labaude. Lovers of Balzac have a treat before them in a book published by Ollendorff—“La Genese d’un Romon, de Balzac.” This is one of those characteristic volumes by the distinguished Belgian collector and scholar, tee Vicomte de Spoelberch de Lovenjoul. The novel in question is " Les Paysans.” Nothing in their kind could be more curious than the revelations here made of how Balzac conceived his stories, of his manner of working them out, and of his general artistic temperament'. There are here, apart from a sheaf of fresh letters, some score of unpubliteed pages of Balzac, all ingeniously utilized by this erudite Maecenas, M. de Lovenjoul, to whom French literature owes some of the most curious bibliographic discoveries of our time. It is not likely that the authors of the three current novels that also lie on my table—“ Le Joyau de la Mitre” (Ollendorff), " Une Ame Obscure” (Ollendorff), and “ Fiancde d’Outre Mer ” (Lemerre)—will ever receive the honours which some of their predecessors periodically receive at the hands of the Belgian scholar; but one of them, at least—the translator of
Byron, Mme. Daniel Lesucur—is not unworthy of the widest recognition, for she is to-day at the head of women writers in Franco, and all three books are to be recommended to English readers in search of recent French fiction. Everything relating to Napoleon is now interesting, and M. Monee Grasilier, who is an adept in exploring the national archives, has published in the Revue .Retrospective and reprinted as a pamphlet the official documents on the kidnapping of Sir George Rumbold at Hamburg in 1801. They give a curious account of Rumbold’s capture and his shipment from Cherbourg to England on a promise never again to approach French ports.

PARIS, Nov. 11.
I have omitted of late to notice the “ novelties ” of tiie French publishing world, but this omission wm not due to any want of matter. New boohs accumulate at this season like mushrooms, and among them one might without difficulty bury oneself away from the world. All that one can do is to take a small group at hazard from the pile, and this is what I now venture to do.
First, as to the novels. The Paris of the boulevards has been talking much of late about a curious tale entitled “ La Giaffe ” (Flammarion), which M. Pierre de Lano has written—in a spirit of La Bruycre, but, I hasten to add, not with his capacity. This story has aroused excitement not because it is distinguished by any special literary merit, but because it shows us, behind the thinnest of veils, the figure of a certain ex-President of tho Republic, whose propos another author had rendered entertaining. I
_ would not pretend that the incidents herein related are such as the historian of the Third Republic can afford to utilize without careful sifting, hut there is a general truth to fact from which the cautious reader can without much difficulty construct an historical picture.
lathe “Robinsons de Faris” (Ollendorff), there is, on the other hand, no need of a key. The novel may serve as the life history of any number of the provincial minages which come to Paris fall of illusions, and, after fluttering like moths round a candle, and endeavouring to make a brave show and to live snobbishly like their neighbours, come absurdly to grief because of the silly falsehood of an ideal which would not allow them to vegetate calmly in the provinces. The book shows real ability.
j hasten to -use the same expression with regard to Mme. Jean Beitheroy’s " Mirage ” (Ollendorff), a work of great literary merit by the author of the " Dxnseuse Pompfiii,” one of the most cultivated novelists in France to-day. She here deals frankly with the problem of modem marriage—that perpetual question of the education of thejeune file which is becoming in France to-day perhaps the most presting of all. Foreigners who o£ter an opinion on the subject are often unlware of the extraordinary place which the French girl ^01^ jjj the French social system. She is the very pivot
ol French convention, so that any change in her position
or bor nature involves a revolutionary movement through-
out the whole compass of French social life. Nocompartitive study of the position of girls in France, Eng-
laud, and America can well be undertaken until one has
mast’ered the sociological aspects of the problem in

nM *hy, 8ho. 1^/^an,foSldd®B to r?d 016 sa?e author's “Agome” (Ollendorff). One good reason why &3Cmt fiUt’ or an5rbody eke> sb°d* not 168411,656 booka is 11,61 thoy are cntorta™ug only by fits -nd starts, and fortbe most part are as drearily antiquarian in their appeal as a show-case of Merovingian jewelry. But no one 6311 cutest their importance as intellectual and artistic efforts, nor their curious and recondite worth. It is much easier to read the famous historical novel “ Sparta cus,” which Mme. Bienstock has done well to
translate and Mr. Stock bad the good sense to publish. Die atmosphere is more bracing, the plot is simple and more skilfully handled, and there is none of the pose M. Lombard. You feel here that .you are reading
history, not romance; as indeed in the " Trois Amoureuses ” (Ollendorff), by Jacques Vincent, which, is in reality history, you feel you are reading romance and D0t history. M. Vincent has undertaken here to sketch
the lives of Emilia of Nassau, the daughter of William the Silent, of her daughter, Maria Belgia, and of her granddaughter, Hcttae Beatrice. They are three subtle studios of three very unlike careers of women, done with
that delicacy and devotion which the French almost always betray in treating of such matters; and what will strike eTery one is the difference between the attitude of . ._<
society under the old rigvmx towards the unmarried gir aud that of our modem world.
And finally among the novels let me mention the new story by M. Georges Ohnet, “ Le Crepuscule ” (OBendorff). M. Ohnet is holding his own, still enriching .. ' « . ...
publishers and himself, And still entertaining with, his mastery of rapid and sensational incident the
same host of readers everywhere. His clientele, however, will, I should fancy, be a little disconcerted by his latest venture. M. Ohnet would seem to be replying in this book to those of his critics who pretend that he amuses and entertains the petite bourgeoisie without awakening any thought. In “ Le Crepuscule ” the reader has a novel with an object. M. Ohnet has evidently been meditating deeply. He, too, aims here at being taken as a psychologist, treating of the law of human decadence and disintegration with a stronuousness from which, after all, the interest of his tale suffers but little. This, then,
is a new departure; but a new Ohnet is always a new Ohnet, and a multitude of readers everywhere who know the true Ohnet flavour will never lose their appetite, I will now only mention rapidly the appearance of four other volumes, each important of its kind. There is first the volume entitled “ Tout Yeux, Tout Oreilles,’’ by M. Jules Hurst (Revue Blanche), in which that brilliant journalist has collected some of his more recent interviews, giving to the whole a title which ingeniously
describes the spirit of these reflections on the Parisian theatrical and literary world. The articles published in the Temps by M. Gaston Dounet, during the Chinese imbroglio, to which their author did well to give permanent form, have also appeared as a volume with the title “ En Chine, 1900-1901 ” (Ollendorff). Finally, besides a new volume of the " Reiset Souvenirs ” (Pion), we have from Hachette a reprint of the remarkable essay on Taine by M. Giraud—the most substantial work of criticism of which Taine has ever been the object. Here is a handful of new books, taken at random from the pile which lies upon my table.—Oar Own Correspondent.

PARIS, Oct. 8.
“No man can be called happy till he is dead ” ; but even after centuries the glory assigned by posterity to the dead, and the place occupied by them in history, may be disputed. This would seem to be the lot of Columbus, if his fame were not such as to defy attacks. Mr. Henry Vignaud, the American Charge d’Affaires here, an erudite and conscientious student, whose investigations have often lit up dark comers of history, has just had published by Ernest Leroux a very interesting and, I should add, very strange volume, were it not based on the most painstaking and, in the author’s view, conclusive researches. Columbus’s son, as is well known, undertook the task of proclaiming and establishing his father’s renown, and he included in his evidence a letter from the Florentine astronomer ToscaneUi to his father encouraging him in his enterprise and lending his influence to it. Some months ago a statue of ToscaneUi was erected, and among the facts adduced for reviving his almost forgotten reputation was the writing of this letter, which was said to render him an associate in the discovery of America. Mr. Vignaud, as an ardent antiquary, set himself to investigate the relations between ToscaneUi and Columbus, and after long and persevering research he was amazed to find that they never knew each other, so that such a letter could never have passed between them. He saw that it was a forgery, and asked himself for what purpose it had been fabricated. He discovered that, after the death of Columbus, there was much talk of a pilot whose name was unknown, who, going to India, had been led into a false track and had then sailed towards America. Later, he turned back, reached India • by the regular route, and on his return told Columbus of his having seen a new continent. Columbus listened attentively to his story, and, on reflection, came to the conclusion that the pilot had found the unknown continent which had long been supposed to exist. Mr. Vignaud has convinced himself that the forged letter was designed to destroy the legend of the pilot, and to hold up Columbus as the real and sole discoverer of America. His book, written in a brilliant style and backed by a profusion of documents, tends, therefore, to prove that the glory of the discovery appertains to the unknown pilot—though doubtless to Columbus in a less degree as the providential instrument for adding the great American continent to the conquests of the Old World. Considering the arduous labours which have led Mr. Vignaud to this conclusion, one asks what inducement he had to undertake them, perhaps, as an American, and an American representing his country in Europe, he does not like tiro discovery to be attributed to a Genoese navigator, but prefers that Providence should have made use of an unknown pilot. Doubtless his national pride makes him regret that some prehistoric American, some descendant of the Incas, did. not discover Europe and make it.an American conquest, instead of having to submit to tire-conquest- of America by European science and enterprise. However this may be, his book is full of new views and shows that there is much perspicacity
■and culture behind the-author’s ardent patriotism. General Marguerites, who distinguished himself in
Mexico and Africa, as well as in the Franco-1 German war, has left two sons, MM. Paul and Victor Margueritte, who are among the ablest and most esteemed of French writers. Sons of a hero, ardent patriots imbued with the virtues and warlike enthusiasm which were conspicuous in their father, they depict with eloquence and truth tho episodes of that war of 1870 which was the cradle of their name and which left them an inheritance of glory which they perpetuate by their writings. Their book, " Les Braves Gens,” published on Monday by Pion, containsaseries of narratives founded on the events of 1870-71 on the banks of the Moselle and the Loire. “ Les braves gens! ” was the well-known exclamation of the German victor when from tho heightsabovo Sedan he saw French soldiers rush on certain death in order to snatch at victory, despite the incapacity of their chiefs. The chapters are headed “ La ChovanchSe au Gouffre,” " Strasbourg,” “ Au SiSge de Paris,” " Sur la Loire.” All are full of interest. Some, like " Le Pigeon de Coulmieis,” are of touching melancholy. Others, such as " L’Hommo de Prills,” are full of humour and keen observation. Otters, again, like “ La Chevauchie au Gouffre,*’ give a striking and terrible picture of actual or imminent defeat. The entire volume is one of the finest works devoted to that campaign in which the French army, so thirsty for glory, was so poorly organized and commanded that individual effort was powerless.

NW CHAMBER MUSIC.
In sho usual absence of anything of very special interest in the way of concerted music published in England, such a work as the trio in B fiat minor, by Harvey Lohr (Schott and Co.), is likely to get quite as much attention from amateurs as it deserves. The work is exceedingly effective for all three instruments, and though the themes are not particularly distinguished, they are certainly very melodious, end are of a kind that will easily be recognized and enjoyed by casual hearers.—A book of “ Styrian Dances ” for piano and string quartet is arranged by C. Egerton Lowe from compositions of Josef Lanner, and is published by Novello
and Co. The sonata in E minor for violin and piano by A. Randegger, jun., is very interesting, written with fine command over the resources of both instruments and far above the average in regard to musicianship. The same composer's " Saltellato-caprice,'* dedicated te Kubelik, wants a Kubelik to do it justice; but hit " Souvenir ” will please a larger number of players. Arthur Hinton’s “Suite ” shows solid workmanship, knowledge of effect, and no little originality; Gustav von Holst’s " Greeting ” is very pretty and well written; and a set of pieces in canon throughout, by Battison Haynes, shows how cleverly learning can be disguised in a most acceptable form. All the “ Six Highland Dances” of J. B. McEwen have character, though some of the more subtle peculiarities ok Scottish music have hardly been brought forward. An arrangement of S. Coleridge-Taylor’s four “ Novelletten,” originally for stringed orchestra, is very well done, and the pieces should be quite effective in their new form. A “ Romance ” and a " Canzonetta," both in A major, both by Theodore S. Holland, and both dedicated to Professor Halir, are exceedingly graceful and not difficult. Four books of “ Btmto Blatter,” by Hans Sitt, containing in all 12 easy pieces fol violin and piano, are an addition of some importance to the number of compositions which do not require the violinist to go beyond the first position, and which are, at the same time, not uninteresting as music. F. H. Cowen’s “ Reverie ” is a graceful and expressive piece
of work. The series called “ The Junior Violinist “ contains some good selections from the classics, six sonatinas of Weber's, and some movements of string quartets by Mozart arranged for violin and piano; and “ The Modern School for the Violin ” has pieces of various degrees of difficulty, edited by A. Wflhelmj and James Brown. An instruction book for the viola, by Berthold Tours, is one of the firm’s useful primers.
A finely invented and really original sonata in G for violin and piano by W. Wolstenholme is the most interesting thing sent by Alfred Lengnick, who also issues a brilliant “ Rondo alia Zingarese,” for two violins and piano, by J. C. Ames.—It need not concern us to discuss the minute differences between Sir Frederick Bridge’s edition of Purcell’s violin sonata in G minor {Musical Sews office) aud that published some years ago under ths editorship of Mr. Alfred Moffat; it is a good thing that the sonata should be pnbliteed in any shape, and the variations of the text are so small that the two editions could quite well be used side by side.—A couple ok pretty fantasias on old Christmas carols, by Hans Sitt, are sent by Joseph Williams; it is only doubtfully correct to call the familiar “ O sanctissima ” a carol at all, but the name does not mute matter. The specimens sent of the same composer’s long series of 20 pieces, op. 73, are excellent of their kind, not at all excessively difficult, yet fresh in invention, and pleasing in idea. A graceful “ Arlette," and a pretty " Fouillo d’Album,” by A. d’Ambrosio, have just the qualities that amateurs like. Gabriel Pierne’s lively little “ Serenade a Colornbine ” has been arranged for violin and piano by William Henley, and is quite effective.—Landon Ronald's " Page d’Amour ” is another piece written with special view to Kubelik's playing,and is good practice as well as pleasing music.—Ths Vocalist is
a periodical publication in which a good many agreeable instrumsBtal pieces have appeared. Two melodies for violin and piano by J. M. Capal are among its latest issues, and both are quite acceptable formoderate players.
As usual, Messrs. Angener’s publications in the class of violin and violoncello music are exceedingly numerous ; for the first-named instrument there are three very graceful and effective pieces, op. 65, by Edmondstoune Duncan, a characteristic " HebridenTanz ” by A. Moffat, a brilliant concert-mazuria by W. Whitaker, a very taking “Orientals ” and a “ Romance " by A. d’Atabrosio, a tuneful “ Minnelied ” by J. L. Roeckel, a " Berceuse plaintive ” and “ AH' Ongarese " by G. Saint-George (both quite effective), and three attractive “ Morceaux de Salon ” by S. Esipoff. Haydn. Wood’s “ Souvenanco ” is a thoughtful and romantic little piece, and Horace Barton’s “ Romance ” is effective enough to servo its purpose ; Coleridge-Taylor’3 " Gipsy Suite,'’ op. 20, has all the originality and fine design that we are accustomed to look for in tins composer ; and if the little pieces by G. de Angelis are not of very great importance, M. Hauser’s transcriptions of favourite songs of Schubert will appeal to a large class of young players. An " Album Antique " of classical pieces, edited by A. Moffat, contains some unfamiliar things by masters of the ISth century that were well worth reviving ; various new editions of wellknown pieces by Ernst, David, Paganini, end ottœzs, appear; and forvioloncello and piano there are a vigorous sonata, op. 46, by X. Scharwerika, Mackenzie's pretty " Earghetto and allegretto,” op. 10, a pleasant little “ Ballade ” by Charles Quid, and a couple of wellwritten pieces by Hamilton Harty, as well as some transcriptions of well-known songs, such as Brahms’s “ Wie hist du, meins Kimigin,” by Sebastian
Lee and others. It is a little odd that Bech’s " My heart ever faithful ” should have been chosen, considering that Orcar Bruckner bus seen fit to make the violoncello play, not the obbligato part, but the melody, sadly to the detriment of the effect intended by Bach. Various books of studies, L<x, are also sent, besides a handy little mmiTtal of violin-playing translated from Carl Schroeder’s book, by J. Matthews.

Sir Anthony Halfwit, en Antiqitrian and Virtuoso, has, unfortunately for him, admitted his relation Frolick upon a visit tohis house-- Frolick, who, the' totally divested.cf malice, has an unlucky propensity to niisclsief——indulges himself in his favourite arousenjent, and merely for the sake of fun, effects all the confusion and misunderstanding, which form'the plot of the piece.--Beaumont, the son "of Sir Anthony’s particular friend, Sir Williajrf Beaumont, is 'expected in town hourly# in order at once to be fettled in a banking-house, and to marry Sir Anthony’s daughter Diana, the match being entirely fettled between the #two fathers ; the perTon of Young Beaumont is "not'known to Sir An-' . thony, and therefore that' circumstance affords an opportunity to Frolick tif "enjoying his favourite object, a joke-; accordingly upon the arrival ofBeaumont, Frolick (in Sir Anthony’s' absence) passes himself on him as the Old Beaumont, -telling him that the real Sir Anthony is a lunatic, "who .assumes the name of Frolick.—Sir Anthony entering' at this morhenr, Frolick plays off the ver)' fame joke on him, introducing Beaumont fo him as a Mr. Medallion, a young man, whose attention to antiquities has turned his brain.— Not content with die ridiculous situations which muss naturally ensue, from introducing Sir Anthony and Beaumont to each other as madmen, Frolic fends a message to Dabble the Dentist, to attend Mrs. Matadore, Sir Anthony’s sister, .an old woman, whose ideas are so much centered.sin
cards, that her conversation teems with allusions to pain and the four aces,—Dabble (a character drawn for a certain Dentist# celebrated for his
erudite, advertisements) now makes his appear- . an.ee, and the old Lady mistaking his converfa-
tiou, for the addresses of a passionate lover, some whimsical equivokes ensue; Sir'Anthony unexpectedly coming in, the old Lady appoints her supposed adorer to meet her in -the evening, which engagement he accepts, still conceiving that he is to be employed to draw her teeth., ' Frolick, in order to complete his scheme of throwing the whole family into the utmost confusion, disguises himself, and resolves to pass upon" Sir Anthony as the long expected Mr. Beaumont. In this he succeeds, and the real Beaumont, from his repeated blunders (occasioned by bis supposing Sir Anthony to be mad) is treated as an impostor.-—At length, however,, he surprises Frolick', in an unguarded moment, and by tearing off Ins disguise, discovers to Sir Anthony the trick which has been played on, him.—Diana, (Sir Anthony’s daughter) who having the day before met Beaumont in Kensington Gardens, is .prepossessed in his favour, and readily bestows her heart where her father had resolved to bestow her
hand ; and Frolick, in order to convince the company that mere whim without personal malice towards them, had Jjeen the spring of his actions, refers them to a scene of entertainment which he has prepared for them.
. To explain this scene, it will be necessary to observe, that in addition to Frolick’s plot of mak-'"z ing Mrs. Matadore receive Dabble as a lover, he had contrived to persuade Mrs.Middle (a female politician, who always takes the dask side of the question) that the poor Dentist is a Freach spy. —It would be tedious to particularize the situa-' tions " which this double misunderstanding of Babble’s real profession involve him, and the laughable equivoques which produce those siruiitions; it is sufficient, however, to sey that at the moment the poor tooth-drawer is disguised, in order to make his escape from the officers of justice, with whom he is threatened by Mrs. Middle on the supposition of his being a spy; Frolick and flic rest of the'dramatis personae, enter with lights, and aneclarcissemcnt takes place, by which it^ppears, that instead of being cither a lover or L spy, Dabble is nothing more nor less than an harmless operator fqr the teeth.
Judging of this piece as a fsce, we must place it in the first line Hf that species of the drama. The fable produces . a continuation of equivoque, supported by many straits o£- nature, humorous situations and strokes M wit. It was received with Unbounded and continual laughter,' and was performed in a stile of Arelrk-s^^ssence.

THEATRE.
Ycfferday evening s new Comic. Opera, calfeif, THE STRANGERS AT- HOME, Written by air. Cott, author of The Humourist, and the Mufic by Mr. Li ties, was performed for the firii time « the Theatre-Royal Drill y-Lane;
'. Dramatis Perfonet.

At this late hour we must content ourselves with only a sketch of the Fable,. which-has more intricacy Of plot than is usually given in an Opera.
The scjfe lies in Florence, and.the main incident arises from Octavio, a young1-nobleman os' that city, having redeemed a number of staves from Algiers, who open the piece' with a procession-and chorus.-
With these captives arc Regnalto and Montano ; the former a merchant of Florence, had’lelt his sister Viola with Aldobrand,, an old avaricious sawyer, who had contrived to keep his unsuspecting friend Regnalto in slavery, to become at dice possessed of Viola and her fortune.
Montano who had been seized by pirates and carried to Algiers, at the moment of his intended marriage with Laura, finds on returning, his beloved ns stress married to a Signor Lucilio, who is in fact her maid Rosa, whom Laura has per-. funded to assume that character, in order to put an end to the importunities of her numerous admirers.
Fi relock an old English soldier, whose favourite - maxim is, to lime all the days of his life, is made -use of tn several of the -situations,"though the plot does not entirely depend on him. This pleasant character was written, we understand, after the first reading of the Opera, and the author deserves considerable credit for the" ingenuity he has displayed in its introduction.
Regnalto is introduced in his slave’s habit into the house of Aldobrand, as the servant of Octavio, who, ignorant of his name and situation, gives a letter to Viola, settling the hour, of elopement. He pretends to be deaf and dumb, and thus becomes the witnesses Aldobrand’s artful endeavours to keep him still in slavery. -
Aldobr . -d though doting on his ward Viola, has still an inclination to. intrigue with Laura. He is persuaded by Alice to di (guise himself as a Confclibr, in order to gain an interview, which Mœy’ tane overhearing, forces him to change drclKs, with an intention by that means of upbraiding "his perfidious Laura with the infamy of her conduct. This gives birth to a number of comic incidents. -A variety of vexatious cross purposes happen to Aldobrand, till by a lucky hit he regains his ward Viola. But his joy is soon abated, by. the news of Regnalto being arrived from slavery, and which -he much dreaded.
Viola is at last seen descending from a balcony in Aldobrand’s garden, by moon-light, tp elope with Octavio. She is prevented by Aldobrand, who furprizes her. Regnalto, who now appears,, discovers himself. Montano is made -happy, by the supposed husband of Laura proving to lie a woman.-—Aldobrand’s villainy is exposed, and according to drarnatic custom, the lovers are limited.
Having thus slightly sketched out the Fable,' ■set us exainine the constituent-parts. The two "principal divisions are the drama and the music, which may be proporly considered the body and foul of Opeya." . ■ 1
The opening is finely imagined, but we thinks ‘it mivht be heightened by additional characters in .the procession, which would give contrast to the train of slaves. The scene .represents a distant 'view of the city of Florence, with the river Arno, .faid is extremely well executed.
As to the conduct of the Fable, we think it ex-' cellent in conception, though it sometimes fails in; action, owing-to-a redundancy- of-intrigue, not airways novel, and carried on like the pantomime comedies of the last century, by the assistance of disguises, concealments, listenings, and fide speeches. For this reason, we think the author: Was'prudentin converting his piece into an Opera, which does not require that strict adherence to na-. turn, and easy rise of. incident, indispensably ne'cessary to a comedy. " ; The author has materially transgressed the ‘rules of the drama in his catastrophe. . Fabio the villain—Fabio shouldn-Qt go unpunished—at least, ■ he should sty at the fight "of his injured friend.
We cannot conclude without’observing, that the "first representation of a drama, should be confidered as. the last rehearsal. The piece before Us is considerably too long, and particularly in the sc-- cond-act.' Let the scene Where the old man appears disguised be cut as short as possible. - * Notwithstanding those objections, it was received with general a»plause, apd if it sometimes strews * deficiency of judgment, it every where displays a strong genius. " ...
We shall take the characters "individually as they stand in th a dramatis, persona, and us ivc examine thern, animadvert upon the performers.
XVe-wili not fay AJdObrar.d was badly performed by Mr. King—if certainly is not a character inlu* cast, nor has his acting of it by any means increased his theatrical fame. His judgment will not suffer him to apply to himself the plaudits given to the author’s dialogue, and we-think, it would.be a strong proof of bis. good fense, if he resiglied the part as Lion as possible to Parsons, for whose abilities aqd manner, iris strongly fmt. ed. His appearance in brown and gold,' is offending egregiously against propriety. Black is the ‘ptaftffiMal die'fcr tire ’habit of ’ lawyers’ all’over -Europe—but he hits .substituted life attire of a -Mountebank doctor."

The . house was for some minutes in'a roar of laughter, but the actor wisely, making a modest, and proper apology, by assuring the audience, that the-fault’ lay with the person who made those thingsrhe was requested to part with his wbifkers entirely.; which he complying with,' the audience applauded, arid he went through the rest ot hir part with very considerable,approbation, particularly in his' execution of a trumpet song.

Laurence w "not" a."new character; but -the younger Bannister supported it in such a stile of hilarity, and gave his song, which was. encored, with such good humour, as created novelty in the acting. Laurence is an eating," drinking servant.
Viola and Laura are nearly similar.—Mrs. Crouch performed the first with hdr usual excellence, and We have never seen Mise Field to greater advantage. Both ladies were happy in'thc choice of their dresses ; which were properly, contrasted, ;an attention that always adds considerably to the beauty and effect •>£ theicene. .
Alice is well adapted to Mrs. Wrigbren’s stileof .acting; she is a very good intriguing Chambermaid : but why so affected in singing ?—why. injure herself by attempting to imitate inimitable Edwin. .. .. . .
Much indeed does the author owe to Mrs. Jor* dan, and in oiir opinion his introducing her into the opera was,the happiest thought" that occurred during his writing the piece: flic played with senHbllity, humour, grace, and nature".
So much for the. characters, which we cannot fay are highly charged with humour; but the dialogue abounds with pleasant thoughts, brilliant witticisms, .and beautiful similiess • Indeed, all the .characters are wit, and seme of the strokes are truly brilliant.

। Yesterday evening a new Farce, written by Mn O’Kceffej called A Beggar on Horseback, Wat presentedi for the first time, at the Theatre Royal
! in the Haymarket.
The fable of this piece is fin?p!e> and well conceived : an old gentleman falls in love with Nannjq a country girl, who, with her broth* Corney> he takes- into his house as sesvantg, but influenced by his paflion, he treats the object of it with every mark of tenderness. Master Gorney, an ignorant* yet cunning and vicious clown* uses the power ot" his stltex’s'beauty over her antiquated gallant, as a means to promote his evrix interest, and in the various capacities of footraatf> coachman, and butter, gets into the Most ludicrous and laughable situations. The old gentleman has a nephew named Horace* who having acted in the country, for a frolic, had there gained the heart of Nanny, whom he meets ar hie Uncle's house. This produces a train of farcical incidents, and the piece terminates with a marriage between this young gentleman dud hit uncle's maid.
The first act of this pent piece, considering it tn the Jine of farce, is unexceptionable in dialogue, incident, and business. In the second the author has not been so successful; for though the design is good, the execution fails, which may be imputed rather to hurry than want of art; and a pasiage or two in the dialogue was found offensive to some over delicate ears : these, however* may be expunged.
Gorney, who is the Beggar on Horseback, was played by Edwin ; and never did beggar ride hit steed with greater success. He was a beggar of rich humour, o\xt-beggarixg description. Upon the whole, it is our opinion, this farce merits, and will experience a very considerable run, istit undergoes a few alterations.
The other performers, particularly Mrs. Wells* did ample justice to their author.

The comedy of the West Indian was performed yesterday evening, by coitotiand/ef their Majesties, as the Theatre Royal, Cofrent-Garden. Every judicious observer must regret the inferiority of the fifth act of this, comedy, when compared to the preceding ones, ahd we are astonish- - ed apd regret, that the author has not re-written it-. . ..-1
The piece-could not have been cast with greater -strength, but unfortunately, J,tickin who was to have performed Stockwell, was suddenly afflicted with a foie throat, and obliged to decline the character for the night, a circumstance much to be re■gretted, though --Feanw, who was substituted, Came off with good credit. Aitkin was the original Srock-vjell, and always gave to the English merchant, that manly and firm .appearance, qualified by those benevolent manners, candour and.’ generosity, which are.the leading traits of the character.
Lewis plays Belcour in a stile we highly ap' "prove. This part depends upon the spirited ex.ertions of,the player—he supported it with "the vivacity of youthful sire, and heightened several of the situations with a brilliant polish.

Of all forts of outlaws, that set of men called smugglers are the most pernicious,by infecting the manners of men ; for, while" they practise most of those vices that generally go hand in hand with unlawful and underhand dealing, they are less anxious, to conceal their actions; their occupation not happening to be branded with the fame degree of infamy-that house-breaking, or.other theft is ; they mix with their fellow* subjects, While at the fame time, they are guilty of those things that are generally attended with every species of vice.
Men are always, and always will be, influenced by .custom and example in their opinions; but as custom and example must .owe their existence to natural propensities, or some other cause, it would seem that men do not consider positive theft, which consists: in the taking what is really-in the possession of another man, to be of the same nature with. that kind of theft that conceals things you have otherwise got posteffion of, and ought to deliver up. - Smuggling certainly is of this latter sort of theft, attended often with the risque of murder, and those other desperate actions "that increase rhe crime.

This piece is avowed in the Prologue to bs the production- of Mrs. Inchbald, author of the Mogul Tale, ajserce, and nil you What, » Comedy, pieces replete with wit and humour.
The farce before us is rather founded upon a fanciful whim than a strong fable. It abounds with incidents naturally springing from the main, subject, and has sufficient humour and wit to mark . its characters; which are drawn with .that elegant lightness, and pleating flippancy, that in general distinguishes the writings of the ladies.
The Prologue was spoken by Mr. Wroughton, but though it had every assistance from that excellent actor, it failed in effect. The concluding tenure is very poor indeed.

Mr. Walmstey, an old. uncle of Lord Light* head, finding himself exceedingly hurt at the cor> - duct.of his nephew, determines to enter into the connubial stateynotwithstanding his great aversion to marriage, merely in hopes of getting a mors prudent heir than his Lordship ; upon which he pays his addresses to Lady Mary Magpye, "and in the zeal of his.courtship, he presents her with, va- . rious curious trinkets, and above all, with an elegant Indian shawl. Lady. Mary no sooner receives the shawl, than she goes and shews it-to Miss Angle, desiring her to keep it for her. Now Miss Angie being in love with Lord Lighthead, complains with her maid Fish, that she has no opportunity of acquainting the object of her heart with her paffion. On this, the artful maid hits on the following expedient: she advises her mistress to send the stiawl of Lady Mary to Lord Lighthead with a letter, setting forth, that the ' stiawl had been presented to her by some unknown person; and, as she’ had reason to suppose, that rr might come from his Lordship, she took the $ariitzA opportunity os returning it; Miss Angle ap- : proves the scheme, and the stiawl .is sent to h;s Lordship.——-But far from answering the intended purpose, which was of receiving an u-nfwer from Lord Lighthead; his Lordstrip on receiving the stiawl thinks that he had actually sent it tx> Miss Angle, and now he thinks of malting it a prer . sent to another mistress, and "sends it to Loveall. Lady Mary comes for her stiawl, which throws Miss Angle and the maid into great perplexities : the latter repairs to Lord. Lighthead, and tells him the shawl was sent to him by mistake, and begs he will return it, but having part- _ ed with it, he gives five guineas to the maid. Lady Loveall being seen with the stiawl, is taken up for a thief; when the parties meet, and a proper explanation taking place,..the piece winds : up with a wedlock in the usual stile.

THA
.
The stage is an object of the - highest importance in every free state, and-the experience of his*iory proves, that liberty has always made her last stand in the Theatre. This accounts for the protection which theatrical entertainments have everreceived from the people-of this country# and this will sufficiently justify us, in thus declaring that the Universal Register shall be found a firm, and warm advocate for . every author, who.keeps the great end of the drama in view, that is, who holds the mirror up to-nature. -
On the other hand we shall never gite our assistance to inexplicable. dullness and dumb strew; vain splendor without real utility, and low buffoonery destitute ot morality, shall ever be treated with that censure and reprobation they, deserve.
The stage is a medium of instruction, which should never be corrupted with impunity, and the people have an interest in its purity ..that never can be aliened.- It*is an instructor that rectifies morals, by representing the rewards of virtue and punishments of vice.. Its examples infuse courage into the soldier, increases the zeal of the patriot, and instills a love and admiration of virtue into every class. Men lowly educated, are seldom acquainted even with the general maxims of morality, but in a well regulated theatre, they imbibe them by the strength of example. Such mtnds require visible illustrations : and these benefits can only be received from theatrical representations#
The elevated lights of philosophy are too strong for-the weak eye of the-vulgar. Tell an ignorant man, that happiness conlists not in the possession of wealth—preach to him that virtue ought Zo seek recompense in itself, and that no interest should persuade a man to do a base, or a mean thing, and he will consider you as stating paradoxes. This makes such men suspect philosophy and even religion. They must therefore be instructed by a means which immediately affects the senses, and such means can only be found on the stage, which has, therefore, been properly filled the School est the People,
In dramatic pieces, exhibited in this school, one indispensable rule Ihould exist, and every deviation from it should be discountenanced. Virtue should be always commended and rewarded, in spightofthc injuries of fortune, and vice never escape without chastisement, or at least without detestation, though crownedWith success.
Asta$e regulated upon this principle can teach every thing morefenfibly, by the power of representation, than philosophy can pretend to, by the force of precept, for on the stage the meanest capacity may visibly fey that the favours of fortune arc not real enjoyments and that the sufferings of the virtuous arc but temporary. They have before theit* eyes the example of calamities—they are Convinced that heaven inflicts remorse and mental tortures upon those whom the laws cannot reach with*corporal puniibmeht.
It is on the stage the people view the ambitious man tormented by his own conscience. The impious wretch, driven to despair by the furies within his own breast-*^they fee the tyrant# who haying engaged in crimes to attain his ends, and after violating the laws of Heaven and earth, fall into misfortunes as great as those he had inflicted upon others, and rendered more unhappy by himself than by his enemies#
It is on the stage that covetousness appears a disease of the foul, the miser is shewn persecuted with continual restlessness, starving in the midst of plenty, from an apprehention that he might. hereafter want. In short, it is the art of the drama to penetrate into the hidden secrets of human najta're, and to touch the foul with a picture of living truths. Few indeed depart from a theatre without carrying with them an idea of the persons represented ; a knowledge of those virtues and vices, of which they have seen the examples and having their minds improved by the moral of the piece.
But, were the exhibitions of the theatre merely nmhfcments, • incapable of conveying instruction, their utility would be considerable by preventing the commission of crimes' -;nd debaucheries. In all great cities there are persons who have jio occasion to apply to lab )ur for support; to such persons, public entertainments are the most innocent mpdesof employment, and it must be allowed, there are no places wherein the trader or-artizan can spend their hours of relaxation to so much advantage. They give business to the idle, and pleasure to the industrious.
These reasons will justify us in declaring ourselves friends to the drama, and giving it every aid ih our power.
In the progress of this task, it will often fall to out lot to pronounce opinions on dramatic pieces and performers. In the execution of our judgments, we .shall strew a liberal disquisition of the merits, and with that impartial justice which is the leading principle of criticism, point out their beauties as well as blemishes.
OPENING of the THEATRES.
The theatrical season commenced on Saturday evening at Drury-Lane. The play Othello, the entertainment the Quaker, Notwithstanding the warmth of the weather, the house was croudcd in every part at first price,-and at after price tlyerc was a very considerable overflow, a circumstance which proves-thnt the attracting influence of Mrs. Siddons is strong as ever. The audience was not only numerous, but brilliant, many persons of the" first distinction being present.
The theatre has not undergone any material alteration, nor has it been embellished with any hew ornaments; nor does it, in our opinion, require any.
Of the play and of the performers it would be superfluous to fay much. 'Othello is Shakespeare’s, and Mrs. Siddons was his Desdemona in most situations, though not every where softened into the gentle.
Kemble appeared much improved, and though his voice often* failed," yet in his acting there were strong marks both of genius and judgment.
Half price being again come round, the city bucks drive westward hoa! tn the evening, and the box lobby of the theatres, appear a la militaire with cQckadcd troops of half pay officers*

An Opera, unjer the title of the Siege of Carrpld, was brought forward at the Theatre in the Haymarket,, forthefirst time,- orr Saturday evening.,—This Drama is avowedly the tstixiuSiou. of flr. O'Ksfe. ..... .
The Siege of Curzola has been antto^ttced to the-public for two seasons, and it is wits" "great concern we feel ourselves forced to declare, it would have been to the credit of the author, con a poser, and manager," Kt® it never been exhibited:
We fed much for the "disappointment of Mr. O'Keeffe, «46s»’h'ufm>ur has .fo repeatedly iept the audience tri a roar, arid who has often raves proofs of "strong-original-genius.- °
The Opera before us is a.pampqfitiott of absurdities, founded, on a . collection "of scenes, irrevea . lant to^ach other, without any claim to originality of character or sentiment, .arid abounding iff paipableplagiarisms,-- obscene allusions,- arsi vulgarities of action, incident, and language. In truth, the. foundation is".bad,- arid the superstructure raised without any attention to" proportion, ordpti pfrelcg'aiice. IFarce is clearly the forte cs Mr. O'Keeffe; and while he adheres to that line of writing", and avoids what the manners," delicacy, " and refinement of fire present times will nor admit of—indecency, he must succeed.; but his dialogue arid poetry are not equal to. the afdaou*undertafc'ing of {applying three or five acts", wherein moral and instruction is expected, as well as laughter..
The overture had considerable merit, and flitadapted airs,- particularly these appropriated to Signora Sestini, were judiciously chosen," the others were mostly parodies upon old compositions,, ot made up -by the affistance- of bbrrowcif variations. Neither the writer nor composer have done justice to Edwin- who, however. Slewed his gratitude for the great service O’Keeffe lias rendered him. on former occasions, by exerting his utmost abilites in support of the piece.
Miss George also played with great spirit, and . fung remarkably well. Bannister did every.thing mao could do to support a character, which was a poor copy of Shakespeare’s Parplies, and Mrs. Bannister acted with-her usual delicacy ; but the efforts of the performers could not support the Opera, which was" repeatedly rind strongly opposed throughput by the audience, .whom it must be. allowed discriminated with justice; arid were provoked into disapprobation.

Last night a eew Tragedy, called ELOISA, was performed-fo.r. the first time at this Theatre. It is the avowed/production of Mr. Reynolds, Author of Werter, performed last season..-- The characters of thislDrania were'as follow 1

This Tragedy, it had been said, was founded on the Story.of Rousseau's Eloifa ; .but,the following sketch of "the -fable -will-strew- that little
more of the romance has been retained, than the
of the principal characters and their situ.

This murder being announced by Hainault as committed, Ernifa becomes frantic.
and sties to the Abbey, where foe ^pursued by . ,her uncle’ . He attempts to stab Eloifa, when he =s prevented and surprized by the intervention of gt. Prcux. He again attempts to fall the lovers, St. Preux.bcing unarmed, but .s prevented by the ai:r,val ot ^'"ers, who stabs Hmnault, and the P‘=ce concludes with the union of St. Preux and 2“a, . , ■ .... , , . , ....
' Su<t,s t!?e outll,ne of th,s Tragedy, which has
many beauties, mid we are sorry to fay, very many dc^; There is an evident want of bust-
ness and incident through the xvhole. The vio-
y are ao extremeyrequent;
ofthese St. Preux’s-resignation of.Eloifa before the
determination of Villers is known, and Hainault’s selection .of Courcy as the assassin, will be sufficient instances. 'The language is frequently inaccurate . no, only half lines are in many places borrowed, which any frequenter of the Theatre must immediately recognize, but whole scenes remindcd us of fimil/r pa.ssiiges in ..Matilda, Jane Shore,
&c. &c. The situation in the fifth act, where
St. Pretix, who is supposed dead, rushes in on Hainault and Eloifa, is too striking an imitation
of that in the Grecian Daughter, where Evander appears under the same, circumstances to Dionysius and Euphrana, to leave the author any ffrong
pretensions to originality. . *
Of the performers in this piece-our language must be more commendatory, as to them we must fay ;t is indebted for.passing the ordeal of last night. Mr. Pope sustained the part of St. Preux "ith much interest and ability. . He combined a very great degree of pathos, with an animation that gave warmth to the scenes where he was eagaged. Mr, Holman had many good points to deliver, to which he did ample justice. Of Miss Brunton we must say, that she has never been seen to more advantage.; foe entered very deeply into the conflicting passions of Eloifa ; her indignation, her rage, -and her disdain, had all the "usual force ; but were also recommended -by a very happy, and yer)' judicious discrimination, , Thelrologue, which was extremely well dehvered by Mr. Pope* contained merely a request thatxth& audience would, evince their usual canaour, and a mention of the alterations which the Kory had received. The Epilogue formed a very humourous description of a city Miss preparing f°r a. Lord Mayor s ball undeythe hands of her dancing-master, and her anticipations ofa coronet befog disappointed, by the suspension of the ball, It was admirably delivered by Mrs. Mattocks, The Prologue, we understand, is written by the Author of the I r agedy; the Epilogue by Mr. Andrews.

The Tragedy*of Venice Preserv’d was performed at this theatre on Saturday evening, with its -tisual excellence of acting, and.was received throughout with .unbounded applause. It would be tiresome to o.ur readers to expect a discrimination of Mrs. Siddons’s powers in the performance of PcIvidera, we shall therefore only observe generally, that file played with such irresistible success, hs raised the passions and fully convinced the judgment that all .she did was critically right.
Covent-Garden.
Macklin made his first appearance for the season—and .never did actor receive a "more hearty welcome—the plaudits, were repeated and universal, and what is very unusual, the ladies joined in them, and with such ardour too, that had the Queen of France been present, she would have seen that English ladies can exercise their fans in the service ofa favourite actor, with as much spirit as her Majesty.
The piece was the Man of the World, written by Macklin-) and tiever was the Man tf the World drawn with so much justice, or represented with such exactness arid truth as by the author.
L ying aside every prejudice in favour of Mrs. Pope, we are willing to acknowledge thai Mrs. Bates’s performance ot Lady Ro’dolp'ha Lumbercourt had great merit, and was received by the audience with very strong marks of approbation.— The task was difficult, what could be more dangerous than, coming before the eye of the public, combating against the acknowledged excellence td so great an actress as her predecessor.
Lewis played Egerton with great spirit.—He raised the climax ot the patriotic speeches with critical justice and natural ardour, and in the courting scene with Lady Rodolfha his humour was admirable.
We are convinced from the performance of Aickin of Sidney on Saturday, and of Jacques-) a sew evenings ago, that his abilities are not suited to parts ui mcr«s declamation, but are equal to those characters which express the feelings of the soul, and require tenderness or animation.
His expression in Sidney, when roused by sensibility to repel the base proposition of Sir Percmax finely evinced a true sense of honour, and that dignity of character which marks a virtuous churchman;

A-new tragedy, intitled'Ceramis, was performed at this Theatre on the 30th ult... The story is imaginary—the scene is laid at Memphis.
Geramis, has been driven from the Throne by an usurper. He left Iris ‘only fort, an infant, in. rhe hands of Norbal. The-ufurper died, and the Egyptians recalled their banished Sovereign— Geramis old and infirm declares that he has a fens and desires to consign to. him the trull and the cares of Government.' He finds Norbal dead, leaving Hirfol and Nbpthis as his two ions behind ' him, the first without ‘oiie dignified paflion but am- - bition, the other possessed of sensibility and virtue. The ambitious Hi rial makes pretensions to the Throne. * "The secret of. which of the two is the son of Geramis, Norbal dh'his death consigned in •writingto .the custody of the high priest. This ' important paper Geramis is afraid to open, left it should announce to him that, the wicked Hirfal was his son. ‘ He assembles the people in the temple, ■ and throwing the paper into the Barnes, adopts Nopthis for his son and heir. Hirfiii,
desperate and disappointed, snatches the paper from the"fire, and reads it in hopes of finding himself the real and legitimate son of the King. The paper declares Nopthis to. be the son, upon "which Hirfal stabs himself,-and Nopthis is crowned.'
’. The story is. heightened by an. amour. The susurperhas’sest a-daughter, of whom both the brothers-are enamqured, but she by a cruel fatality is'in love with the villain;. In the managcj, metis of this amour there is much address. Se| rises, ashamed-of her preference for the most undeserving "osttbe two, is not willing to avow it.

This scene was highly applauded. It was - original and interesting. It was, however, almost the. only , one which was honoured with the public voice. The fourth act totally- displeased the audience, and they did not approve of the denouement. .A tragic hero may want virtue, but he should preserve dignity.

THEATRE.
In our observations oh-the stage, we hare long over-looked several objects of material confideration|in the regulation of 1 theatre.— The plays and the actors suffer every- day under ill-natured animadversions, while the audience, who are for ever offending, generally escape with impunity—their conduct is the subject of this essay, and I shalt divide them into classes.
THE BOXES.
. With the bright circle that decorates the fide and front boxes, little fault can be found; for though a groups of females sometimes converse ur tones above the actors, they are generally homely tabbies, or antiquated fusty maidens, whose personal charms failing to attract admiration, determine them to draw the eyes of the audience upon them by noise : But let them examine the looks "of those who notice theircoaduct, and they will nor have much to boast of, they will fee contempt and indignation depicted on every countenance.
As.to the gentlemen who frequent this part of the-theatre, if not all men of fense, they are most ok them men of breeding, if we except the half price bucks, but they, however seldom appear except in the lobby or green boxes!
GREEN BOXES.
These boxes may be likened to those parts in some of the foreign theatres on the Continent,' where women of certain free description arc ad* mined ; but with this material difference, that in this country women of good character frequently, mix with these dif_i plcs of Venus the tnereirici-" mis, a circumstance which should have seme weiebt even with the molt proffig:tc of oui blood:j and relirain them from offending the chaste ear of the innocent virgin and honest matron with inifeLcnc language.
THE PIT.
The pit audience is composed of periods' where' the poet describes.;
•• More firmed against than finning." because they are lionets harmless people, generally pretending to a great deal of wit, bur peflctting a considerable share of simplicity, a,id toerefore their principal object is, to receive In entertainment, value for what they pay at the door. The pit, however, is not without its faults, its tenants often joining the galleries in encoring long, and laborious songs, and opposing reasonable demands by no, no, and off, off, to the great discomfiture of the performer.
FIRST GALLERY. .
This gallery is frequently alarmed by fracas from drunken ruffians and abandoned prostitutes# but these disturbances, it must be allowed, are less frequent than heretofore.
second gallery.
This is a region which, though last mentioned; is not least in notice. Its frequenters often insult the pit, and with impunity, availing themselves like others in high life of their exalted stations, to throw and scatter indignities upon those beneath them, which they do in the shape ok orange peels and apples- These gentry are never contented with the-bill of fare held out by the manager, but v-aCiferate for Roajl Beef, Peas upon a Trencher, or the Brown J ugg, and often indeed become actors themselves by entering into loud conversations of low humour, and joining in fungs anst chorus.

All In the Wrong, with the Cheats of Scapin,
This theatre opened with particular eclat after the recent suppression, to a very croud.’d, but the universal fables forbid us fay, a brilliant audience, The novelty of the night, Mrs. Belfille, from the Norwich theatre, in the part of Belinda. This lady’s figure is striking and elegant—her face is beautiful, and her.manner, if we consider the embarrassment of a first appearance, sufficiently easy. In .addition to these requisites, her e - nunciation is clear and distinct: many of her sprightly passages had merit, and her pathos was not without its force. Her manner in some scenes resembled that of Mrs. Abington, undebased, however, by the servility of a copyist. Weihuse to speak thus negatively of this lady’s merits, and lu'pend our judgment, because we think, with her powers file may do more. The iii'fr appearance, particularly of an elegant female, is too unc. rtain a test to forma decided opinion of the degree of excellence flic may be found to
possess-
Mis. Mattocks in Lady Restless, had all the traits of discriminated humour and vivacity which usually distinguish her performance, and Lewis in Beverly gave many scenes with uncommon effect, particularly that in the fourth act, where his fondness breaking out through his resentment, was given with the happiest force of transition.
■ Mr. Ryder in Sir John Restless, deserved a very high degree of commendation. The comic scenes in general were enriched with great humour, particularly the Park scene, where the compart' son Beverly with his picture, the absurd questions to detain him, the “ what length is the voyage to Botany Bay”'—all arose from the occ<lion, and shewed the judgment, while they evinced the powers of the performer.
His Scapin, as it shewed him in a new light, demands a different kind of praise. The spirit os arch intrigue and low humour, pervaded and recommended the whole of the performance ; and frotn the bursts of applause which accompanies his personifying the different characters, while beating Gripe in the sack, we -are apt to imagine that this force, however extravagantly laughable, is likely to become a favourite with the audience.

Scene, a Castle and its vicinity, situated in a forest in Germany.
The subject of this opera was originally dramatized in France, and brought out at the Comedic Liaiienne as a musical comedy, and its success was very considerable, owing to the music, particularly the chorustes, which are remarkably fine.
The piece before us is a regular opera, and to adopt the words of Puff, is not translated, but fatten from the French. Several of the characters, the dialogue, and most of the songs, being new.
The English author has also avoided several gross anacronisms, and monstrous improbabilities, ■ which appear in the French.
TJie dialogue breathes a spirit of liberty and loyalty.
' 'The French author has not attempted one character ot humour. The English author has introduced La Bruce, Berghen, Margery, and Lauretta, which character in the original is sentimental.
The French music is retained—the music introd need is from Anfoffi, Corolan, and David Rizzio. The new music by Shield.
The fable is simply this : Richard the First returning from the Holy Land, is made prisoner by Leopold Duke of Austria, who basely delivers him up to his enemy, Henry Emperor of Germany. Henry confines him in a strong castle, to the care of a brave and honest soldier named Florestine ; but the place of his confinement is kept secret. Morgan, a elstl soldier, having steel from England with Margery and Lauretta, hiswife and daughter, on account of transgressing the forest laws, commences publican in the neigh bourhood of the castle. Berengeria, Queen to Richard, and Blondel his friend, came to this bouse unknown to each other ; the Queen pretend-.. she is going to retire into a nunnery— Blondel under the disguise of an old blind minstrel. - Florestine the Governor being in love with Lauretta, sends her a letter by Guillot, which her father intercepts ; and it being read in the hearing of Blondel, it comes out that there is a stranger closely confined in the castle; which induces Blondel to suspect that Richard is the prisoner. In consequence of this suspicion, he mounts the parapet of the castle, and sings an ode of Richard’s composing ; to which Richard answers from a terrace ; but at the instant of the discovery, the soldiers rush from a postern of the castle, and seize Blondel. The Governor coming out at the same time, Blondel assures him, that his bustness was to deliver a message from Lauretta to him ; and the Governor promises to come at night to her father’s, where a wedding is to be celebrated. The Queen having disc >vered Blondel, they admit Morgan into the secret; and on the Governor’s arrival he is seized by the asst stance of her knights, and the keys of the castle , taken from him ; by which Blondel, Moigan, and the Knights get admission to the castle, overpower the guards, and relet le their Sovereign.
From this sketch of the bustnest, our readers will fee, that there is a continued and progressive interest which increases gradually to the conclusion. The unities of place and time are well preserved: and what we have rarely seen in productions of this nature. The under-plot is strictly connected with the upper, by makT.g Lauretta daughter to Morgan, the instrument of the King’s ■ deliverance. There is also a vein of pleasantry running through the whole, not forced or artificial, but evidently growing from the bustness of the scene.
The piece was supported, by all the operatical strength of the Theatre. An apology was made for Mrs. Billington, who we were informed, was seized with a sudden hoarse nest. For this, how.-ever, we scarcely saw occaston ; there appeared, indeed, some little deprestion of her powers in . her first song; but in her -first long in the third .’act, (hefar exceeds our praise. The richness of . her melody, the extent and variety of her cadences were so many claims on our most rapturous approbation, and stamped her the first finger that ever graced an English stage.

' Mrs. Martyr was extremely well, particularly in her song with staccato accompaniments, in the second act, and in the duet with Johnstone, which
. immediately succeeded.
Johnstone exerted himself with an energy . which.did him honour. His-fongs, “ Oh, sweet remembrance! airy sprite,” and that beginning, “ Surrounded in the thickest fight,’ whereby he discovers his Sovereign, were both in his best manner.- Edwin in La Bruce was seen to advantage, and he repayed the author for the situation he had afforded him, by the strongest exertions of
-
h*s wonted Ability. Had 'Mrs.- KctweJy an J Mrs., Brown been oftner introduced, it would have added to the pleasure of the audience.

RICHARD COEUR DE LION.
b
lL
e pubc expectation-was last? night amply gratified, by the appearance of Richard Cater de Lion, at this Theatre. Th6 double anticipation of this legendary tale, on the French Stage, and finch on that of Co vent-Garden, has rendered it a subject of such publicity,, that it becomes unnecessary for us to repeat the particulars.
The principal deviation from the original, as it was last night exhibited, is that of effecting the deliverance of Richard, by the immediate exertions of his Queen Matilda, under the disguise of a minstrel, instead of Blondel, to whom the French
author consigned it. Thus by making her love and conjugal fidelity, which rises superior to every difficulty, the substitute for the friendship of a faithful follower, not only the interest and pathos are extremely heightened, but a field opened for the display of Mrs. Jyiidan’s judgment and pleasmg precirion in speaking, and tor the best exertion of her vocal powers. A few other minute, but critical deviations, prevent all dullness of narration, and effect a rapid and lively representation, of the translation we can with great j office say, that the dialogue and poetry evidently discover their being the production o! first rate abilities; and the adaptation of the music to the words, a d the talents of rhe several performers, as strongiy characterize the judgment of a Linliy, as the composition itself does rhe taste and elegance of a Gretiy. The merits of this excellent master are sufficiently known to the public, by the perfonnance of tae piece -at tne other house, and it could
loss nothing oy. being adapted to the poetical harmony of th! Songs in the present performance, Tim scenery certainly does the highest credit to the invention and abilities of that very skilful artist Mr, Greenwood it is not confined merely to rhe effect of the pencil, producing a pci fpective upon a flat ; but following the example of Loutherhourg, he covers the whole stage with l.enery, tnd gives the utmost effi-ct the arr is cap,hie of producing. That which principally demands attention, is the 'cene of the Castle and Moat at sunrise, in, which, for novelty ia invention, and perfection in the execution, he seems to have gone '-ven beyond his predecessor; it is a chef<sœuvre, that seems the ne plus ultra of the scenic art.- The dresses and other decorations besp-.ak an excess of liberally in the managers which truly deserve encouragement; they have spared no cost or pains to make Richard appear with becoming
grace.
, Of the performers, we must observe, they all discovered such a wish to please, that they could not fail on the foundation of that merit alone, to obtain the applause they so generally met with :
but their, merit was nor circumscribed by, apparent inclination alone; each in their line did ample justice to the merit of the piece. It'is almost unnecessary to fay that Kemble represented
Richard with true regal dignity ; and sustained his own, even in fingiag, which though out of his province he succeeded in remarkably. Mr. Barrymore sustained the character allotted to him «ith that attention and propriety for which he is remarkable; and Mr. Bannister in the, British Knight gave us that pleasure we ever receive from ms manly and, harmonious powers.
Of the Ladles, Mis. Jord in, in Matilda, was every thing our most sanguine expectations could form—She, with her usual perspicuity, truly conceived the nature of her part, and with a just and affecting pathos both in her speaking and ssngmg, strongly attached our feelings to the char-ic-
ter. We could not but lament, that the lovely and melodious Crouch had not a greater scope.
th“ the Part of "ff-rded for the exertion
h=r p°"-raof pfoasmv- By the pe.formance * this petite character, Mrs. Crouch will rife m
the estimation of the public, as it evinces her as-
ayv-
hie in :he conduct of those possessed of her merit..
rhe charaster, though small, requires that expression of innocence, loveliness, and d-licacy, which no one is more capable than herself to fe-
present. We know not, however, whether we ought to regret the want of the introduction of Italian music, in which, her vocal abilities have frequently appeared so pre-eminent, since it has convinced us she is equally excellent in giving ef-
sect by the- sweetness of her tones, and her natural judgment to that simplicity of harmony, from which we last night derived so much pleasure, We are glad to find Miss Romanzini moving tn a more respectable line than that foe has been hither-
to confined in, she gave strong proofs of rifiug tafonts, in the part of Antonio, her first song was admirably fung, and throughout her performance merits every applause and encouragement, By way of a bon touche we have'rescrved to the
last, the mention of the little Syren of the Stage Miss De Camp, and most sincerely congritulate the Managers on their acquisition, and the Publie on the prospect of such a fund of entertainment as they are likely to receive from the astorushing abilities of this little enchantress; who,
both from the peculiar sweetness of her voice, her surprizing taste and judgment in singing, and her wonderful graces, agility, and exertions in danciug? at so very early a period, excited our applaufe and admiration. We know not from whence the Managers procured this juvenile wonder, but we pronounce, that she will prove a
prize to them. The two Miss D’Egvilles must not, however, be passed unnoticed, whs, but for the extraordinary exertions of that fascinating fairy De Camp,. would have attracted very pecu liar notice; much praise is however due to them, Upon the whole, the Richard Cœur de Lion of Drury, we have no doubt will continue from
its collective merits, and the general support it receives, to experience that truly deserved, and conslant succession of loud and universal applause, which was so liberally bestowed by a very crouded audience. As the Managers must have been at a very extraordinary expence in' the production' I of this piece, we sincerely wish them-all success,' and doubt not they will prove it, from that gene-
rous spirit of liberality which so 'justly charaiterizes the British nation in rewarding the exertions of genius and real merit,

Experiments have been tried in the environs of Paris, in rhe pretence of the Duke of Orleans, rb- Duke FitzJames, the Comte de Provence, and Mont. Dtrcrot de Bclbader, in the fame fields, and the following was the result:—Duke Fitz James from fix bushels of feed sown reaped ten more bushels •than from the twelve bushels of seed sown in the common method; the Duke, the Comte, and Mons'. Ducrot de Belbader, were all equally successful, and reaped nearly in the same proportion. It is also asserted, that this powder will produce tolerable crops even upon barren land, and has the fame virtue of increasing grass, restoring consumptive plants, and all sorts of flowers, vegetables, &c. &c. Of what ingredients this powder is composed, or whether it preserves those qualities here boasted of, must be left to time to determine.

THEATRE.
DRURY-LANE.
. On Saturday evening this theatre opened with, the School for Scandal and the farce of All the World's a Stage. The opening with the first of these evinced the greatest judgment in the managers. No play could be more proper for that purpose, as it comprises nearly the whole comic force of the company, and what is yet more, it is happily adapted to the forte of those whom it includes. Often as we have seen this admirable comedy, we confess that, on Saturday night, it grew upon our estimation. The performers are all so mellowed in their respective parts, and they exerted themselves with so much spirit, that every’ point was given with new force, and the delusion of the scene- was perfectly : complete. The audience received their old favourites .with unbounded marks of applause ; but cf these' the greatest share fell to Mess'. King, Palmer, Parsons. Smith, and Miss Farren. Mrs-Incbbaid played Lady Sneerwell, in the absence of Mrs. Ward, and her performance gave us no reason to regret the substitute.
The screen scene wav one of the finest pieces cf. acting which ever appeared on the stage, whether we notice the feelings or attitudes of King, Smith, Palmer, or Miss Farren ; and was a Hogarth now alive to pencil their characters, it would, be one of the most striking prints ever exhibitedon the boards of either theatre.
The House was extremely crouded ; and among, other persons of fashion we recognized, the Portugueze Ambassador, General Paoli, and a party of foreigners who filled the Prince’s box.

We recommend to the Managers never to give so trifling an after-piece, after such an excellent play, but rather to diversify it with music or pantomime. Baddeley took occasion to make an allusion to the late tremendous incident of the desert, knife, which he compared to the silver spoon of the mock tragedy. Perhaps Baddeley looks to the felicity ot carrying up an address, and to clap his sickle into the present plenteous harvest of honours. If' so. Sir John Baddeley would certainly cut a figure in the bills.

COVENT-GARDEN.
(By a Correspondents)
Last night this Theatre opened with the Belles Stratagem, and the Farce of Patrick in Pruilia. This Comedy has in general more show than" intrinsic merit, and the sentiments which occur are raised too far beyond the tone of conversation. These defects, however, were overlooked in the excellence of the performance, and it was played, to a crouded and brilliant audience, with incessant marks of approbation.
Of the attractions of the night, the fl rouges! was the return of Mrs. Pope to the stage, after the absence of a'fenson. Her health seems fully reestablished, and she gave to her Letitia even more than its accustomed charms. In the expressive language of Brooke, " her looks were elegance, her movements grace.”
The return of Mrs. Mattocks to a London stage, was also honoured with an earnest welcome, which file requited by playing the Widow Racket with spirit and propriety. Mr. Farren in Sir George Touchwood, and Mrs. Wells in Lady Frances were highly respectable.
Mr. M’Crcady, who made his first appearance in Hutton, though labouring under an evident' embarrassment, acquitted himself with much- propriety : as far as we could judge, when a little time has. worn off those petty habits, on which we " are obliged to comment in every provincial actor, be will become an useful acquisition to the Theatre.'-" -
-The humourous improbabilities of Patrick its Pruffia, aided by the melody of Johnstone, and the comicality of Edwin, difmifled the audience in perfect good humour with the entertainment and rvith themselves.

ALTHOUGH Mr. Palmer has not had the fessod fortune to succeed in his original scheme of performing' tegular-dramatic, pieces,'yet by his judicious management, and Wonderful- exertions, ■he is enabled to; and at the fame time does, afford infinitely greater novelty, than any theatre of the present day. -The ttoldiiess of this assertion is, without dispute, rather presumptuous, though the truth of it, I am persuaded, will be stilly established, by the brilliant company-that nightly honour his theatre with their presence. The performances of late have been varied every evening, which at once evinces his indefatigable assiduity to please every palate. His exhibitions at this time may certainly vie with the most powerful competitors; particularly in the vocal line, in which he doubtless may lay a just claim to pre-eminence. The whole of his entertainments are replete with wit, humour, and the keenest satire; so that they form a delightful repast to every lover of mirth. But, above all, the grand Tragic-Pantomimic performance of Don Juan, exceeds every thing of the kind ever produced ; the revival of which .redounds greatly to Dclpini's credit; for it must be confessed, it is got up in a most superb and elegant sslle. The scenery is beautiful beyond description. We think, if any one scene has the preference, it is the view of the storm and shipwreck, which, in truth, is finely executed. Bur we cannot dismiss this article without mention of Mr. Palmer’s inimitable representation of Don Juan ; as it is our firm opinion, that the character cannot have the dignity of person more strongly featured, than in this unrivalled performer. The different situations of "mirth, gaiety, and horror, are delineated to perfection. In short, from the specimens- Mr. Palmer has already given of his unremitting attention for the amusement of die public, the greatest expectations may be entertained of his future fucc.-fs.

The Tragedy of Douglas, which has not been performed at this Theatre, since the much to be regretted death of Mr. Henderson, was last nightbuought forward with-Mr. and' Mrs.. Pope, tor the first time, as Douglas and Lady Randolph.
The youthful gallant Douglas is particularly suited to the fine figure and manly air of Mr. Pope—indeed we never saw this popular performer in any character in which he appears to such advantage—the glowing ardor of Sir Malcom’s heir was nicely tempered by the softertints'of filial affection, nor in any instance did "his colouring of the Heroic Douglas ‘‘ o’erftep the modesty of nature.”

Mr. PALMER, proposing to open his Theatre to-morrow evenpig, with rhe utmost deference presumes to solicit the patronage of that public, to whose indulgent kindness he is already to much indebted, and on the continuance of whose favour lie places his sole reliance. Had Mr. Palmer experienced the fame lenient forbearance, by which the theatre at Birmingham, q nd many others in the Itingdom, are enabled to exhibit dramatic pieces, his exertions, as an actor, would have been unremitted. That not being the cafe, Mr. Palmer submits most chcarful ly to the laws of his country, however he may be detrimented by the severity of their oper tion. Although, through the friendly cflices of Mr. Harris, Mr. Palmer has been marked, in his theatrical capacity, as a rogue, a •vagaioad, and “ sturdy beggar—yet, as a member of the community at large, it has been his wish to discharge the relative duties becoming a good citizen.
Under the authority by which the RoyaltyTheatre will now be opened, Mr. Palmer will offer that species of entertainment, which shall have novelty to attract, and, he humbly hopes, excellence to please, those who may honour his house with their presence. ■ Rendered incapable of executing the whole of his design, his utmost powers shall he used to render the partial system left him, .perfect in its kind. Those who know the difficulties which Mr. Palmer hath had to encounter, are sensible, that even to open his theatre on any plan 6f respectability, is matter of surprize, rather than of hope; for there is not a stogie performer engaged by Mr. Palmer, whom-Mr. Harris hath not.personally endeavoured to dissuade from appearing on his boards.

Mr. Palmer will not trespass longeron the publie. in his novel undertaking he'has experiencedevery discouragement, and a great deal of obloquy. The last, when proceeding from anonymous pens, he considers not of sufficient authority to merit notice. The discouragements thrown in his way, Mr. Palmer hath endeavoured, to the utmost of his power, to surmount. His object is, as a man, living by public estimation, to render himself generally acceptable in his profeffianal capacity ; find an indulgent public will, he doubts not, by their generous patronage, enable him to triumph over his enemies, and finally render his efforts successful.

Description of Mir. Palmer’s-New Theatre, etear Welidte-uarc. ..
The HoyaRfTheatre; for so it is denominated from the ground oil which it is erected being-within the precincts of apaidee, is constructed of the-' -Very be& materials, iirithtr.expehce nor labour having been "spared to sender it" a perfectly compleat building;. . If there -fie any fault in the architect, it is of the seme riitu're with that iniput-. ed to Sir Jehu 'Vanbrugh, who; in deligoing.the Opera -house, .carried strength and. solidity to such an excess, as if he" intended his edifice to defy the is vages of time.
■Mr. John WiUmdt, the architect, seems to Eave fallen , into the seine, i'f the expression be allowable, laudable error; for, contrary "to the in terest of his profeffion, he -has -been the fabricator of a building, which, from it.s excellent workmanship, will "occasion the proprietors to incur very little expence IN the repairs- during the continuance-of-a century. Mr. John Robinson," of Wellclose-square, and to whom the’ superintend- • afice of the heir work’s at Woolwich was commit-" tid, is surveyor of the Royalty Theatre; in which capacity ha,has (hewn the utmost (kill aud judgment.
- The 'galleries of the Royalty Theatre are infinitely superior to any belonging to the various Theatres in the kingdom. -Being of a semicircular form, "there is not a situation from which' rhe spectators will not have a distinct view of every part of' thb stage, and from the last seat of both galleries the extremity of the building is conspicuously diseemed,! without stooping,-or in any manner varying the natural position of the body. Tfris is an excellence which neither of the houses in the metropolis can boast: and as the advantage of Hie foreign, over our national Theatres, has principally' arisen from the audience part being semicircularly constructed, the designer of the building we aye now describing has judiciously ivaiied himself of such a plan. The upper gallery of the Royalty Theatre will, on the most accurate computation, contain fix hundred and forty persons. The second gallery will contain one thousand ; the pit three hundred and sixty ; the ’Front boxes one hundred and ninety-eight; the fide boxes three hundred and ninety-fix.— The whole length of the Theatre is one hundred and twenty, and the breadth fifty-fix feet.
To the elegant lightness of tke building may be added the beauty of the decorations, in which exquisite taste is displayed. The pillars, which support the' Upper tier of boxes, are not within any of the architectonic orders, but of the fancy kind, and enriched trusses; the middle pillars
partake of the Composite order ; arid the pillars of the lower tier incline to the Doric. Over each box there is an entablature, on which trophies are painted. .The ceiling of the Theatre is highly finished ; there arc four spandrel p-mnels with ornaments in chiaro ofctiro ; in the center a iky, with a border -of oake#s leaves, and the whole is bordered by a galoss'. The Theatre is painted a stone colour, the borders richly gilded. A light crimson paper has been chosen for the boxes, and they are lined with a watered morinejof a correspondent colour; tire border of the paper is of •a light ground, with re legated (colours. The stage box, on his Majeity's fide, is decorated 'with the Royal-Arms, in chiarirofcuro; the opposite box has the arms of the Tower.'
The stage of the Royalty Theatre is considerably longer and wider- than that of the Opera - house; and the scenes are much higher than those at any of the Theatres. The pit passage is" so spacious, as" to be capable of- containing as many persons as the pit itself. There is a most excellent box lobby, abounding with every con. venience, and a drawing room for the ladies, iu
the ftyle of the Opera House. The whole of the boxes are to be illuminated with glass chandeliers, made from a drawing truly elegant. The ceiling •Cftht boxes is considerably lot tier" than that' of either of the houses; arid carc has been taken to r.ender the different avenues as convenient -as possible. What is theatrically termed the Drop Cloth, represents an octagon saloon ; the pillars as the Doric order in two niches are the figures of Prudence and portirude. Above the entablature there are two pannels; on each of which is represented, in basso relievo, "a sacrifice ; .the one to jkbars, the other to Diana. A gallery leading from, .the saloon to other apartments terminates the Hew.
"• Having ■ mentioned the decorations of this. new Theatre, it would be an unpardonable omission' not to pay a tribute to the merit of the artifl, who ■ has-difp’aq-cd so eleganta tafle on the occasion. Mr. Dixon, by whom the organ was painted which is. used in the .Abbey on. the commemoration of Handel, and whose hand is flitting uiflia-. b.le at. the Pantheon, and in the King’s Box at the Opera-house ; he is the person selected to paint all.the scenes at Mr. Palmer’s' Theatre, and" to whom,, whatever there is of novelty, of beauty, or of excellence, in the theatrical parrs, should be ‘‘attributed. On the fourth of June,, being the’ birth-day of oyr moil gracious Sovereign, Mr. Palgier proposes to open the Royalty Theatre; and the summer season not interfering, with the ■ interests of the winter houses, the spirit, of contention cannot possibly sub list where there is hot an object of ’rivalship for which to contend.

.THE Tragidy of Othello IVas prcfitoted, on Saturday, to an indifferent house, which- must, in some degree, be attributed to the unceasing IhoiVers of the'evening,' and novelty of the. ,nrev Robin Hood, hot to the want of attraction at this Theatre's, sot, where can we find snore than in the.Othello ah'd Desdemona of Mr. Kemble and Mrs. Siddons ? . not to mention the acknowledged 'Excellence of Bensley’s Iago.
Thegehtl'e Desdemona has ever beeti.,confi* dered- at a secondary object. Youth,beauty, -find figure', with not any great share of dramatic ■taleht, • have generally been considered as the proper requisite's for sustaining, it with effect. It was reserved" for MrS. LiddoW to rescue the character from its original insignificance; and, by a molt exquisite display of nature, refined by art, to bring’ it- forward as' a principal character in one of the most sublime hiltoricAl paintings of our immd’rtal bard.:,
Mrs. Sidd'onS’.s . Desdemona was, if possible, superior to any of ..her formes representations ; the intercsstons for Gallic; her terrors on hearing Othello’s account of the handkerchief, with her arch evasion of his demand for it—were most beautifully impressive. Sir . Joshua, Reynolds, sivho was in the Orchestra, seemed particularly attentive toj -and delighted with, every feature and movement of this excellent actress. >
:Kemblc’s Othello was distinguished not only by several new readings, but also by a hew dress, made after the Moorish,fashion, with an enormous turban of puffed muffin,- which set off the softness of Ms visage with much force of contrast. His flowing hair was hid under a wig, resembling the shaggy wool of .the Negro-; and the tout ensemble, aided by his graceful figure, had a most striking effect.
. "Kemble seems to have studied this difficult character, in which so few have succeeded, with uncommon attention; nor have we ever beheld him in any,, where he has set up so many powerful claims to critical commendation.
Bensley’s'Iago is a most perfect representation of the deliberate villain, judiciously glofled over, from the ferutihizing eye of common observation, by every outvedrd shew of honesty, keeping ever in our view the poet’s idea of—Honest, honest Iago I
- Barrymore’s preparation for the drunken scene of C-astio, did hilh touch credit ;■ bis air and manner had a wildness perfectly 'descriptive of the effects of the havoc one cup only had made on the weakness of his brain. , His mocking of Iago’s song had much comic effect.
Palmer, in the absence of Dodd, performed Roderigo, and both looked and played the. filly Venetian remarkably well.
Mrs. Hopkins’s exertion, in the last feenes'-of Æmilia, were forcible and animated ; though we are of opinion Mrs. Ward would make a much more characteristic representative of the Æmilia, of whom Iago was jealous;

Mademoiselle Cerito appeared for the last time this seasot on Saturday, and the farewell of the audience was the crowi of her brilliant career, and at the conclusion of every pa4 she had the pleasing task of acknowledgi3g the gift of a fresl bouquet. First came the Gitano, that graceful and dignifeie
relative ofthe C4Atcha, the danseuse displaying at everj mnovement her elasticity, her buoyancy, her absolute commanc oyer the dance, and concluding with that expressive ections the erect drawing up of the figure-an action wvhich seem, to signify the most amiable pride and self-complacency, AR attempt was made by the audience to procure a repetition, but Cerito hae' exerted herself too much to undergo the same fatigue again, and she merely came forward to acknowledge tbe applause. The Gitana was danced between the acts ol the opera, the ballet was an abridged form of the Lac des Fees. In the brilliant yis de deuer in the second act, Verito outshone herself, The advance from the back of the stage with Albert was terrific-a display of the greatest physical power, accompanied by a burst of energy that seemed to ,ave no bounds, but to be compelled to express itself by the rmost reckless movement. In thigs step the youthful spirits, which always give a charm to Cerito's dancing, are beightened to thefieror of a young Bacchante; a Thracian Mtenad xight have advanced thus for the demolition of Orphens. This movement was loudly encored, an,d Cerito gained a fresh round of applause by the good taste she displayedin giving to Albert a portion of the ouquct& that were profusel throwvn. the easy soaring step with which, after thisestonishing movement, she lightly skim3s over the stage, was a most pleasing contrast, exhibiting no less power, but power in a subdued form, not developing itself as before in pure reckless-
e. Guly Stephan, on her entranee, wvas loudlygreeted. She came forward with great force, but presently subsided into the quieter style, dancing with accomplished grace and neat-
irosung to tier perfect intelligence of the steps she was executing, land proceeding without an effort. Hers was the gcntle lyrnc of the "eoetry of motion," Cerito's the wild aithyrambic. The Stynanpos de deux by Cerito and Albert concluded the ballet. It is quite an uniqae dance; the lady appears altogether at the mercy of the gentlemau, who sometimes twirls her round like a teetotumn, sometimes pushes her umcourteously from him, persecuting her round the stage. An inferior dancer could have made nothing of it, but Cerito entered fullv into its humour, going through the sudden evolutions witfi careless strength and naitvet, rendering the dance a joyous sport of youtL She was called for at the fall of the curtain to receive fresh bouquets from the boxes, while the deep thunder of approbation rose from the stalls and pit.
The opera was Lucrezia Borgia, one of the few very modern productions which has kept the stage for three seasons. It has an interest from containing a brliant part of Grisi's, and from being the first opera in which MIario appeared before a London audience. The first chorus, rendered so powerful by the accession of L-ablache, vas encored, and Gr si was caed for at the end, but there wvere portions which went rather heavily. The conduct of Lablache in taking a charaeber (Garella) ia this opera, which is lilerally no more than tha2 of a principal chorurs sinlger, is deserving of all praise

HBR IMAJRSTPS THEATRE.
The new ballet of La File dc i'EriM, produced last night, commenced under circumstances decidedly inauspicious, act the ftrst giving fearful signs that it would be act the last. Nothing went kindly; the hrst dance of Siberian exiles was rather like a parcel of ragamuflin people radely shakmig one snother about, than anything connected with an elegant entertainment, and the auience began so soon to be
erfectly dissatisfied that hisses came from all parts of the honse. Then there was an immense quantity of dull action
rior to the journey of Elizabeth, and then on that jeurney Elizabeth was stopped by a number of uninteresting Cossacks, and all this without a single dance, so that we began to think that as we had lately seen farces without jokes, and comedies without wit, a still bolder experiment was to be tried, andthat we were to be favoured with a ballet withoat any dancing. All this while signs of disapprobation continued,when theCossacks were dispersed by an eveat that threatened to be more serious than any that had preceded. AMademoiselle Guy Stephan, who played Elizabeth, flew to a large wooden cross to save herself from the Cossaeks, and the intention was, that the Volga should burst its banks, overwhelm the Tartars, and carry along in safety the heroine clinging to the cross. Good intentions are, alas! not always fulfilled, and in the present case the unruly waters not only drowned the Cossacks, but knocked down the cross with Idlle. Guy Stephan upon it, who fell screaming violently, and having famted away, was supported by some of the drowned men, who benevolently revived themselves for her assistance. The waters having accomplished this lawless work, fapped their canvass waves to the lamps in ghastly triumph, while the curtain, .which under such circumstances should have descended with double rapidity, and concealed the scene of horror, refused to fall more than half-way, mutinously waving backwarda and forwards, amid the wailings of scene-shifters, and the sibilations of the public. At last down it came, ri-htinto the middle of the waters, which having done all the mischief they could, had coagulated themselves into an inert lump in the front of the Stage. So ended act the first, and a fearful pause followed, which lasted so long that the audience began to shout for Laporte. Mlatters looked
most unpromising; here was a public out of humour, the first danseuse in al probability too frightened to go on (if not hurt), and machinery performing every function but, that for which it was designed. Nothing looked so like condemnation. But no ! The fates were not so spiteful as they appeared, or indeed rather seem to have provided this gloomy commencement to make the conclusion more bnlliant. Mademoiselle Guy Stephan came on, in the second act, look-ing as well as evez-, in spite of the tumble, and was generously greeted by every one in the house. Then she recounted the story of herjourney to the Czar in pantomimic action with so much feeling and animation, and eJhibited so much more dramatic power than she has hitherto been supposed to possess, that she drew down the warmest applause. The ballet concluded with a very splendid ball-room in the Czar's Palace, in which Guy Stephan, Alesdemoiselles Pierson and Keppler, M. Guerra, &c., introduced some very pretty and characteristic dances, and the curtain fell (qmckly enough this time) amid unanimous approbation. Thus did a piece which began so mournfully come to an honourable concusion, and with a little curtailment is very likely to become a favourite, an4 gain an accession of public favour to MIademoiselle Guy Stephan, whose energy and presence of moind in saving a piece under such very trying circumstances cannot he too highly commended.
Annia Botena was the opera last night, Grisi, Rlbini, Lablache, Granchi, and E. Gisi sustaining the principal characters. The vicissitudes of the ballet have occupied the space that might have been devoted to a more detailed aCcount of the opera, and ns it is so well known, it will be sufficient briefly to state that the great artis,ts cted and sung with their usual excellence, and that the opera was well received tbroughout.

flER MVAJESTrY. TiHF,TRE.
The Opera was completely crowded on Saturday night, the performance being on Uliovanni and the new ballet of XAI,na.
The ballet has been shortened by the omission of a warriors' dance by the corps de ballte, and Cerito's Spanish dance, both in the fourth tableau. These omissions are judicious, as they lighten the piece in its least effectiva part, and at a time wheu the audience begin to think theyhave remained long enough. A further improvement may be made by shortening the interval between the second and third tabieensr if, indeed,this can be effected so as to leave zime for the change of dresses for the ball scene. Alma is such a beautiful ballet that it is worth every possible attempt to bring it to perfection. Not only is it the most brilliant spectacle that has for many years been seen on the Opera stage, but the three principalsas have never been exceeded for invention and beauty. The first of these, the valse defascination,whenthestrange little demon and the daughter of fire lure the German maidens to dance, was composed by Perrot, and the conception is worthy of a Ketsch. Perrot has made a finished portrait of the frolicsome Mephistophiles; the saucy turn of his hat, the insol- nt strut the half-mischievous, half-terrnfic look of defiance which he casts round him, produce an effect which the odd expression of his features tends greatly to heighten. There is a fine want of courtesy in his mode of asking the three reluctant damsels to dance, in his holding up his finger with a sneer of superiority, fally aware that come they must. But his power is incompletew thout the aid of his fair coadjutor, thefile du feu-Cerito. Lie must invite her to join in the temptation, and then it is irresistible. Here the pvus brings out very prominently an element in Ceritos dancing with which the public have been less familiar. It is not the exhibiion of physical force, but of power subdued down to its easiest exoression. Hers is a sort of quiet witchery; it iuplayful yet malicious-atmost demoniac. Nothing can be more perfect as a dramatic pas both in its idea and the delicacy with which it is worked out, than this ra!se defascination. The second pas-the pas de trois-by Cerito, Camille, and M. Desplaces, was invented by Cerito, and the slow part of it shows the most refined perception of the beautiful in the arrangement of groups. While Uerito has of course reserved for herself the principal place, dropping in the most varied attitudes in the arms of Desplaces, her disposition of the third figure (Camille), who, separate from the other two, always completes the group, is most elegant. The third pasthe pas de trohs-by Perrot, Guy Stephan, and Fleury, was invented by Perrot. This dance is excellently adapted for the display of those rising danscuses, Guy St phan and Fleury, the former bounding' along with energy and animation, her facebeaming with excitement, the tsll figure of the latter springing with equal force, yet appatrently less excited, and more calmly trusting to her physical strength. These tiree pas are enough to iusnsre the success of any ballet, even if not produced with such superb decorations as Alma.

;- O VENT-GARBD1'THEA TRF-
The third aeason of this hosnse began last night, ana the emens that attended the. openi`g were far from favourable. The manager, findig :he could,not work 'ithhis English company, had engaged;. troop of French juveniles, who sing, act, and dance. With these the audience were generally- not, pleased, and the chiefpart of. the evening passed in uproar.
It: cobmTenced with -a new farce, caUed Quits; a-slight -piece, chiefly Eupported by MT. Himilton, a rather lively actor of Hibernians. An Irishman. is about to nafry an old maid of fortune, but-relinquishes his project because he finds it wiU deprive of her expected wealth a young lady to whom an officer who saved his life is attached. This met with no very brillianat receptionj the -malcontents beginxing to raise their voices as the "4 tag," or, toncluding'spaeech, was spoken.
Then came a getesque Chinesi dance by M. Laurengon, who, as we understand, is the,Juler of fhe juvenile company. The dance was a Clever absurdity, -such as -these things usually are, and was applaudet moa-higorously. So likewise wa a miauet executed_by two tiny urchli s in court dresses, a little episodo of the gentleman tryingwto commiit suicide, and 'the laly fainting, being espeejlly amusing. A Savoyard song by a little boy -sitiW 4'ya dyig3t(zoaso suecess1u; but still the question narturaly suggested itself, "H oxw long can all thie go on ' The theatre looked so large, and the entertaWimeat giVetAOokca 80 na ll, tffere ias such a want of dignity in the exhibitioni, that it was ispossible not to conjecture that tbe storm would come at last.
Annd the storm did come-bursxting with Immense violeace. Over a ballet pantoraim6 in one 'At, called L'Anda?oule, which was supported by the Ridgways and M. Laurencon, who played a grotesque farmer.- That this sort of exhibition could have succeeded atCovent-garden, under anycircumnstances, -we are not ipclined to -believe, bu4t certainly iU-fortune was much accelerated -by tLe-selection of such terrible rubbish as thisballet. It was composed of aUlthe vworn-dut practical jokes that are -current in the comic ballets played in the provinces and the scry mlinor theatres. There were all the old pleasantries of cudgelling and getting into tubs, and hanging by the leg, and M. Laurengon was a humouri3t of too dry an order to stem the torrent of disapproval. It is not improbable that some of the audience went to the theatre on purpose to express discontent; but still we cannot help thinking that there were many who felt that such an exhibition was degrading to a national theatre. One incident, that of some vilLagers sliding down a hill while pursued by a recruiting party, created a temporary laugh, but the greater portion of the baUet was performed amrid the, most terrific combination of sounds that an indignant audience could contrive. There wras the steady, continuous hiss, there was the deeply-fetched yell, there was the sonorous. cry of " Off, off," there was ironical applause-in short, nothing was wanting to render the tumult complete. -f. Laurencon, who was-the particular objebt of dislike, seemed to dance in an atmosphere of detestation, which grew thicker with every additional caper.
Theaudience cannot be blamed for showing their strong disapprobation ef sulch execrable trash as thia ballet, but thle continuation of diatpprobation throngh the vaudeTille that followed was less justifiable. The baUe.t r would have been a disgrace to the Gravesend theatre, and was danmed most deservedly, but the vaudeville was well *acted aud meriwed some forbearance, though we are perfectly ready to. admit, that an Euglish national theatre is not the place for such performances. It was *the well-known MiWiel e: Chr,istie, which is geDeraly played whenever we have a French company in Londoui, and of which an English version exists under the name of Lore in uwrible Life. The little feUow, Colbrun, who acteEl the peasant Michel, really played beautifully, and wvith a courage and pertinacity before an opposing audience that merited a better fate; but the public havinag disliked the ballet because it was bad, disliked the vaudeville because it was spoken in French, and the " row" that ar6se oa this occasion was not inferior to the first; The people in the dress b-oxes were rather inclined to support the p=rformance, but the malcontents were mighty in the upper boxes and in the 2s. gallery. Thd Is. gallery was too thinly- attended to *be of any ' importance- indeed at balf-price only a single person appeared in it. A 2s. wag, desirous of showing his alic attainments and the strength ofI his lungs, kept. shouting out;
' Re" p{'" 4i Allez ',ovus en,,?; amid pg-Jlb gf Wi-b thus inidung hlUnelf the ringleader of the disiatisfied. Wheae the storm was at its height, and poor little Colbrun made a gesture of despair, Mr. H. Wallack, the mauager, rushed on the stage, and, seizing him by the hand, said to the audience, "' The act of this little boy is the severest reproach to the black-guards there." This was bad generalship, for it nave the enemy anuoortuni of yelling in -reply-" lVallack, you have msultda British puli2c," "Shame, shame r" and so on. Mr. Wallack perceived his error, and explained that he did not intend the offensive epithet to any one Per. sonally; adding, that there Tras one person in the ga lery who was the cause of the disturbance, and who should be watched by the police. The malcontents were however by no means satisfied to find all their efforts reduced to the act of a single individual, and one of them, wvith stentorian lungs, shouted b,hat "their name was Legion." The speech of Mr. Wallack served in some measure to queU the tumult for a time, but it broke out vith renewed violence at the end of the vaudeville, and while little Colbrun was singing a song before the curiain, he was saluted with cries of "G (o to bed, little boy." About this period, the .irst tier of boxes promised to be the scene of a most practical "' row." A lad', taking the part of the performance, raised a cry of " police," with the intention ofgivinginehargeone of the hissers in hervicinity. This drew a rush of persens to the spot from other

ST. JAMES'S THEATRE.
The Polka, that wonderful dance which has so suddenly shot up into the meridian of popularity, dividing the public attention with the most vital questions of state, has at last found its way to this lHttle house, which, by the by, is its natural home, for from the French it is that we have caught this Terpsichorean infection. Much of the extraordinary sensation which the dance has produced we think may be attributed tothe fine state of vagueness in which it at present exists, for of the entire cargo of dancing-masters who immediately rushed to the Tower-stairs, on the first wafting of the name to British ears, not one but has returned sole possessor of the real Polka, and denouncing all athers as spurious concoctions and utterly un-Bohemian. At present our knowledge iS limited to the fact that brass heels are an indispensible inzredient, and that the steps are more or less approaches to the dancing which usually accompanies the song of " Jim Orow." The little piece in which the Polka was introduced last night at this theatre, danced by Madame Albert and a Mademoiselle Forgeot, is entitled La P2wes de la Poldk, and is as absurd in its purport as the subject deserves. It represents the court of some provincial town as occupied with the trial of an action, brought by the citizens of the said tovn against a certain instractor of the Polka, on the plea of its turning the heads of all the female inhabitants, and causing the terror of all respectable fathers of families as to the moral welfare of their charges. The cause is regularly tried before the lieiuenant-gene-al. and ileaded on the plaintiff's side by an old lawyer, whose distaste to the dance arises from his l%meness, and on the defendant's by a plump young advocate w'ho is himself under. tuition to acquire the incriminated Polka. After citing various ancient authorities in favour of dancing generaUy, he calls upon the coujt not to decide until they have themselves seen the Polka. The request is granted, and forthwith two ladies in full Polka costume, armed with brass heels, enter the court, oie of whom, to the astoiahment of the judge, he finds to be his wife. The Polka, is danced in the openi arena, and its fascination is so powerful that ere long the whole court in wig and gown are seen jigging to the measure. This, of course, decides the affair, and the curtain descends on the trinumph of the Polka over the moral prejudices of boiurgeois and p res de famile. It is needless to say that a vociferous enore was the result, and it was accomntnied by the projection of one or two bouquets. The Po 'which was danced on this occasion differs from all those we have hitherto seen but whether it be the genuine one, let M. Conlon and a jury of native Pohemians decide.

BOYAL CRORAL SOCIETY.
At last night's performance of Berlioz's Faust Sir Joseph Barnby's choir were again in splendid condition, and their singing reached a very high standard of cecellenco throughout; the dance of peasants,the burlesque " Amen " for male voices,the choral accompaniments to Faust's dream, and other sections were sung in a manner which left little to be desired. The orchestral numbers were less completely satisfactory, though the usual encores were claimed for the Hangarian march and the dance of sylphs. The latter was taken at an unusually rapid pace, and at the close of the fne Easter hymn the flute passages were very roughly played. The defect was atoned for by the remarkably good performance of the same instramEnts in the dance of will-o'-the-visps, the best played of the orchestral movements.
Originally intended for a mezzo-soprano, the part of Margaret is not one of those which best suit Miss Anna Williams; the powers of this distinguished artist are to a great extent wasted on music which requires nothing more than tenderness and simplicity of expression, and which lies outside the best part of her voice. She was suffering from hoarseness and an apology was circulated in the hall on this account; nevertheless, she sang the ballad of the King of Thule with great taste and' artistic feeling, and displayed much dramatic power in the trio. Mr. Iver Ll'Kay sang extremely well in the whole sce;ne of the trio, but for the rest he failed to impazt much effect to the title part ; Mr. Henschel sang the music of Mephistopheles with his usual dramatic power and humour, making the most of the " flea " song and of the mocking serenade, the latter of which had to be repeated.

In August, that month of depression in matters theatrical, it is not surprising to see such houses as still find themselves in the happy position of being able to keep open their doors making efforts to add to the attractiveness of their entertainments. Thanks to that clever and amusing jumble of song annt dance called Atorocco Bound, the Shaftesbury Theatre is one of the lucky ones, and no better fillip to arouse the interest of its patrons could have been provided than the new dance introduced last night by Miss Letty Lind, entitled " The Surprise Dance." It is stated to be an imitation uf the serpentine dance which has recently acquired so much popularity, with novel ideas and fancies of Miss Lied's own. The result does credit to her in every way, and the reception it met wi'th proves that this dance will do much to draw the public to the theatre even in this dull season. The play itself has been brought well up to date. Tho topical songs deal in bumorous fashion w-ith the recent development of superabundant energy in tho I-ouse of Commons, and Mr. J. L. Shine's song descriptive of Irelandi under Home Rule was loudly encored, as was also his duet with Mr. Danby giving imitations of music-hall singers. Mr. George Grossmith, jUn., in the small part allotted to him, makes a decided hit. Considering the amount of vitality there is about it, tbere can be but little doubt that .torocco Bouad will continue to hold the favour of the public for some time to come.

CLASSICAL DANCES AT THEDORS
The latest exponent of what goes by the name of “ classical dancing " is Frau Gertrud von Leth, who gave a very artistic little entertainment on Thursday in the somewhat incongruous surroundings of the Dote Galleries. It was left for her to dance a whole sonata, and in choosing Beethoven’s op. 28 for illustration she was quite wise, for the scherzo apd funeral march almost of themselves suggest the art of gesture, and the variations of the first movement allow of sufficient variety of movement. The danger might have stopped from some design of Canova or Flax man, so much of the classicism of the 18th ceptury ;s suggested ip hor girlish figure and her facial type. Willa she employs very much the game kinds of gesture and steps as those of Miss Maud Allan, with the unchanging smilo of Miss Isadora Duncap,sho has some of the forme" artist’s wonderful power of translating the phrases of the music ipto steps of her donee so literally that in some of Chopin’s studies she seemed to be dancing the right notes while the pianist was certainly playing she wrong. Her sense pf rhythm is very highly developed. Her costumes are in excellent taste, though there is, of course, not very much of them; and in some of the waltzes of Brahms, op. 39, she manipulated a scarf with remarkable skill. Eight boys from the London College for Choristers sang between the dances, but did not add much to the attraction of the entertainment. If Frau von Leth ia to have a success in London, sho must secure the services of a moro competent pianii t than the lady who essayed the task with very moderate success.

PALACE THEATRE.
' ,
At her 18th.special-matinee, given yesterday, Miss Maud Allan interpreted for the first time four movements of Tchaikovslcy’a " Casse-Noisette ” suits—tho reed-pipe danco, the Arabian dance, tho danco of the sugar-plum fairy, and tho Valse des Fleurs. They were all good opportunities for her beautiful, artless art. Fundamentally there is something childish and untutored about Mid? Allan’s performances which seems to guarantee their spontaneity. The music speaks through a new and lovely instrument; there appear to be no rules, no science to come between the music and its expression in movement and gesture. And though we may feel sometimes that tho music does not always affect ns in precisely tbs way it affects Miss Allan (there is a passage, for instance, in Chopin’s funeral march, another of yesterday’s dances, which inspires us with totally different feelings from those expressed), it is clear that she is extraordinarily sensitive to tho music, besides inevitably graceful and beautiful in translating her emotions into movement. About the " Casse-Noisctto ” suite opinions and feelings could hardly differ. Tho only possible criticism would be that the similarity of the sugar-plum fairy to the Mendelssohn " Spring Song ” might argue a poverty of invention; but that would hardly be fair, for invention is not in the case. Tho movements of the sugar-plum fairy are a little those of the maiden in the spring meadenya, but sho is not the same person; just as the Arabian dance introduced some of tbo Salome movements, while the two were widely different. Perhaps Miss Allan was at her best in the Valse des Fleurs. The music of it seemed to intoxicate
a delightful performance, full of fun and fantasy, and of tho grace and beauty which this dancer see ins realty unable to avoid. Miss Margaret Cooper’s songs are a most important and popular feature of these special m atinees, and the bioscope comes at the end.

Dancing took place m the large drawing room on the first floor, the fireplaces and window recesses being filled with pink and white hydrangeas, while in the retiring rooms masses of rambler roses were arranged with much artistic effect. The balcony was covered in with pink and white bunting, and made a cool resting place between the dances. Supper was served downstairs in the dining room and also in the small garden, which was' covered in and transformed into a bower of crimson and- pink rambler roses, while numerous electric lamps, half hidden in masses of pink and white flowers, were suspended from the roof. About 300 guests took part: in the dancing, which was kept up until an early hour.

Salzburg's First-Rate
Idomeneo
FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT I
SALZBURG. AUG. 21
There was a time, not so long ago, when Idomeneo was scarcely known even to Mozart lovers; the performance on Saturday at Salzburg showed most graphically what a popular opera it has become. For after the premiere itself (Figaro) and Karajan's Trovatore this splendid production of Mozart's first great opera was on all counts-socially and musically-one of the highlights of the present festival.
The lion's share of this success must go to the brilliant youdg conductor Peter Maag, who is certainly one of the finest Mozart interpreters of our xeneration. The Vienna Philharmonic played with fire and enthusiasm, but also with the greatest delicacy. One of the most delightful effects was that of Mr. Maag's harpsichord playing: he not only played the secco recitatives with real imagination but during the accompanied recitatives he artfully played the harpsichord with his right (or left) hand, which in soft passages added a most intriguing sound-musically very effective and historically correct-to the soft sheen *-f the Vienna Philharmonic strings.
The production (Paul Hager) and the sets (Stefan Hlawa) were very close to those of the recent revival at the Maggio Musicale, where Mr. Maag also conducted and Mr. Hlawa was responsible for the visual element; but the Salzburg production was in overy way superior to that of Florence. Waldemar Kmentt as Idomeneo sang better than we have beard him for several years; his voice 'bas taiken on a darker colour, but it still rings over the orchestra with youth;ful vigour. Elisabeth GrUmmner as Electra brought the house down with her C minor aria, the climax of which includes two cruelly difficult runs to top C; and Pilar Lorengar as Ilia displayed a warm, sympathetic voice and a fine sense of phrasing. Against these three principals, Mr. Ernst HaRfinger. as Idamantes, was perhaps not the best choice vocally, thouth he sang with great cultiv ation, especially in the piano passages, It is a pity that Signor Renato Capecohi's talents were not put to better use, here in Salzburg: for Arbaces is reallly a very minor part.
ADMIRABLE CHORUS WORK A special word of praise should go to the Vienna State Opera Chorus, which sang with admirable precision throughout. Most of the ballets (wvhich made the production last year so long) have been cut out of this year's Idomeneo; and no one missed them.
In view of this really first-rate performance, it was a pity that Salzburg continued to use the version prepared by Herr Bernhard Paumgartner. The layman, unfamiliar with this wonderful score, can hardly imagine the cruel cuts. the senseless additions (bars repeated to enable the chorus to get on or off stage in time), the unmusical graftings in the recitatives and, above all, the changes in sequence in Act 111, with which this Paumgartner version is burdened. By destroying Mozart's beautiful sequence of keys in Act III, Herr Paumgartner was forced to compose whole sections, lifting pieces out of Electra's recnative before her great aria and giving them to Idomeneo; and instead of the powerful chorus, " 0 voto tremendo ". with its sinister muted trumpets and timpani, leading. bv way of a thrilling crescendo, to the famous " pizzicato " chorus, the latter was placed before " 0 voto " and the whole dramatic sequence ruined
It seems really beyond belief that anyone would wan.t to improve on Mozart's sense of timing, his innate dramatic flair. No doubt the fact that Herr Paumgartner is also president of the Salzburg Festival was a prime motive in using his version of Idomeneo; but, whatever the reason, we surely have every right to expect unadulterated Mozart in the Salzburg Festival, and it is high time that someone prepared a version of this great opera that corresponds, in its essen-tials, to the score Mozart wrote.
Another high-point of the present festival turned out to be the suest appearance of the ballot from the Theatre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels. Using the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Pierre Boulez, the famous company gave us brinliant performances of Stravinsky's Les Noces and Le Sacre du Printemps; the choreography of Le Sacre was quite a shock to the Salzburg audience, whose knowledge of Freud is perhaps not that of their Gallic counterparts. But having swallowed the often drastically realistic actions on the stage, they v-gorously applauded at the end. Ballet in Austria has, for the past 100 years, been something of a step-child; and we have not seen-even in the Vienna State Opera-anything like the precision and beauty of the Brussels group.
MUCH-LOVED INSTITUTION
Mozart's Cos) was the subject of a recent article in these columns; and 100 years ago no one could have predicted that this miraculous but then misunderstood score would one day be the opera of the Salzburg Festival. For, even m-lore than Figaro, Coei seems to our generation to sum up all that is the essence of the Mozartian spirit. The rightly famous Salzburg production (Schwarzkopf, Ludwig, Hermann Prey as Guglielmo, Waldemar Kmentt as Ferrando, Graziella Sciutti as Despine, and Carl DMnch as Don Alfonso), conducted by Karl Bohrm with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, and produced by Gunther Rennert, has become a much-loved institution.
If one might prefer a more elegant Don Alfonso-Franco Calabrese was, for* some reason, not a success when he took over the part some years ago here-and if this year's production sometimes verged on the mannered, nevertheless it is hard to imagine a more perfect female cast than Schwarzkopf, Ludwig, and Sciutti. It will interest many readers that E.M.I. is preparing a new stereophonic recording of this opera in London this autumn, with Mesdatnes Schwarzkopf and Ludwig, and to be conducted by Karl Bohm with the Philharinonia Orchestra. There is, happily, no doubt that Mozart's Cosi has become not only an artistic but also a commercial sueces&.

| Rodney Miines's opera choice: War and Peace |
Coliseum, London WC2, Oct 27 & Nov 1; in repertory until Nov 28 (020-7632 8300) PROKOFIEV'S OPERATIC version of Tolstoy 's novel is one of the greatest
challenges that any opera company can face: it is four hours long, there are 13 separate scenes and more than 100 named roles from the lead characters to
assorted partisans harrying Napoleon (above) and his army during the retreat from Moscow. Prokofiev was himself harried by the Soviet thought-police as he struggled through endless revisions to make his work conform to the tenets of socialist realism and the demands for Stalin - wors hip . He died on the same day as Stalin in 1953 without seeing his masterpiece staged. Given the circumstances, it is amazing that the opera should be as coherent as it is, but the glorious runes and orchestration, sumptuously romantic and bitingly astringent by turns , carry it through . ENO has a strong cast for Tim Albery 's new production: Simon Keenlyside as Prince Andrei, Willard White as Kutuzov (the Stalin role), Sandra Zeltzer as Natasha, John Daszak as Pierre, John Graham-Hall and Susan Parry as the Kuragins, and Peter Sidhom as Napoleon. The designs are by Hildegard Bechtler and Ana Jebens, and Paul Daniel conducts.

FROM OUR MUSIC CRMC
LEWES, JuN 13
Gluck's Alceste is never likely to become a stock opera and perhaps not even to attain the currency of the same composer's Orpheus. All the more important therefore that an organization
like Glyndebourne should undertake to ! mount it. I
Everyone knows of its historical importance, and the famous preface has fittingly been printed in the programme book this year. But an opera cannot keep itself alive on history alone: it must have sufficient musico-dramatic vitality in itself. All Gluck's reformed operas, from Orpheus to /phigenia, however much of the old opera seria still clinfs to them, have this viability. If last year s production of Alceste demonstrated so much, this year's revival in a much more vivid performance amply confirms it.
The strength of this performance is the consistent style in which Greek classicism is seen through the eyes of French classical drama. Sir Hugh Casson's monumental sets, containing the tremendous archaic statue of Apollo, are similarly not a copy but a view of antiquity. Professor Ebert has provided exactly the right amount of movement, notably for the chorus, to ensure that Gluck's break with eighteenth-century convention, boldly declared by the choral invocation of the opemng, carries its intended dramatic force, and everywhere the light and shade of the action is faithfully depicted on the stage.
Miss Laszlo's interpretation of Alceste has acquired both depth and strength since last year, and it was not merely " Divinites du Styx " but each of her big arias that bore the opera along. Her voice may not possess great variety of colour but it has a purity of line that is invaluable to Gluck and to the classical style. Mr. Richard Lewis, with sufficient heroic ring in his tone, sang with greater freedom and conviction. Apollo, whether as priest or deus ex machina, was sung by Mr. Raimundo Torres, who has a weighty voice for the dual role: he seemed dramatically uncomfortable as the priest, external to the part so to speak, but as the god conveyed authority. Mr. Thomas Hemsley treated the equivocal character of Hercule with the right touch, and the Evandre of Mr. Dermot Troy, like the other smal parts, was admirably done.
The opera was sung in French and in the French version. The French language is difficult for an international cast, but if distinctive French sonorities were generally absent it can at any rate be said that Gluck's music was originally written to an Italian text and only adapted to French in 1776. Mr. Vittorio Gui's hand on the music was suavis in modo but fortis in re. Hence the style of the result.
