A satisfying treat of plain and simple storytelling
Theatre Sam Marlowe The Gruffalo Duchess Theatre • •••#.
Seven years after first being performed at Chester Gateway Theatre, Tall Stories' gently appealing adaptation of the bestselling children's book is still going strong. So much so, in fact,
that this festive West End run has been extended, giving more audiences aged 3-plus and their parents the opportunity to chime in with the rhyming refrains that are so familiar from the story by Julia Donaldson. Here, too, are all the characters who inhabit the brightly coloured woodland world of Axel Scheffler's illustrations, economically yet vividly brought to life, in Olivia
Alice Parsloe, as Mouse, meets the Gruffalo, played by Mark Peachey Jacobs's production, by a bubbly cast of three. The Gruffalo is, as its legions of young fans know, a hungry mouse's tale of adventure. Nose aquiver, the diminutive rodent sets off into the forest to search for hazlenuts to nibble — but predators lurk among the trees, eager to make a meal of this tasty mousey morsel. So Mouse resourcefully concocts an imaginary friend — a fearsome, toothy, warty creature called a Gruffalo — to scare away slavering foes. What is our tiny hero to do,
though, when it turns out that the imaginary monster is very real indeed? It's a tight squeak, but Mouse's ingenuity saves the day. Isla Shaw's set and costumes are simple and earth-toned, and James Whiteside floods the scenes with the golden-green light of a storybook pastoral morning. There's a score of jolly songs, and the trio of actors animate Donaldson and Scheffler's cartoonish creations with verve. Alice Parsloe's Mouse has a childlike innocence and enthusiasm; and Mark Peachey is both a nimble narrator and a dopey, gallumphing Gruffalo. Best of all, though, is Tom Warwick, a scene-stealer as a flat-capped, ska-singing, diamond-geezer Fox, an upper-crust flying-ace Owl and a hip-swivelling, maraca-shaking Snake. Between them they develop a warm rapport with their entranced spectators — and they even slip in a few sly jokes for the grown-ups. ""Three years at drama school for this!"" Warwick remarks in an aside as his moustachioed Snake lambadas into view. There are no gimmicks, no flashy props or elaborate stage business —just sweet, simple storytelling and a satisfying, seasonally snow-sprinkled happy ending. Forget all that fancy gift-wrapping, for young children this unpretentious little West End show might just make the perfect holiday treat.

Meeting Neil Gaiman on the eve of the publication of The Graveyard Book, his latest, Amanda Craig finds that his wild imagination knows no boundaries — from films, to books, to theatre, and more
UNTIL LAST YEAR, Neil Gaiman may have been the most famous writer you've never heard of, but with the filming of Stardust and Beowulf, and the dramatisation of The Wolves in the Walls by the National Theatre of Scotland, all that has changed. The equivalent to a rock god ever since his cult Sandman books were published 20 years ago, Gaiman is now one of the biggest things to hit child-
ren's publishing since J. K. Rowling — also, as it happens, published by Bloomsbury. I'm in Covent Garden to interview him about The Graveyard Book, an interlinked collection of tales about Nobody, a baby boy who escapes from the serial killer who murders his entire family, and is brought up in a graveyard by ghosts, vampires and werewolves. Like his bestselling child-
ren's novel Coraline (also being filmed for release next year), it takes you into some scary places but, as he points out, what adults read as the most uncomfortable thing they can imagine, children take as a huge and thrilling adventure. ""Adults know I can take them by the hand into a dark place and run away, whereas children trust me, and I want to repay that trust,"" he says.

Not for nothing is one of his best fantasies, Anansi Boys, about a young man who discovers that he's the son of the African god of mischief; one of the joys of reading Gaiman is how he subverts our expectations of magic, horror, fantasy and the mundane. An immensely likeable man with messy dark hair and, at 48, an endearing love of leather jackets, he was born near Portsmouth in Hampshire, the son of the last independent vitamin manufacturer in Britain. A geeky child who embarrassed his younger sister by always having his nose in a book, he went straight into writing after school. For two years he lived in Edgware and ""did the starving writer thing, producing a bunch of short stories and a children's novel that everyone rejected before I realised that I hadn't written enough, lived enough"". He then had a wonderful three years in the early 1980s, working as a freelance journalist for publications such as Time Out, ""living off chicken wings at film screenings"", and interviewing everybody he wanted to meet, including Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett (both of whom later collaborated with him on books.) But in his mid-twenties his love of comics became too powerful to resist. Graphic novels are now pretty mainstream and respectable — when I tell Gaiman that my teenage daughter wants to become a graphic novelist he exclaims at once, ""Good — then she'll become very rich!""
However, it was unexplored territory to all but adolescent males when he began the Sandman series; he still gets the owners of shops such as Forbidden Planet saying: ""I got to thank you, man, for bringing women into my stores."" Part of the attraction was that ""unlike the novel where you'd be on the same shelf as Apuleius and Austen, comics have been around for only 100 years and there are all these cool places nobody has taken it as an art form. It's harder than writing film scripts — it's like writing, directing and editing a film."" Now published as ten books, Sandman's market still keeps growing, and 20 years on, what seemed like the most disposable medium has become enshrined in leather bindings and a huge international fan base. Almost all Gaiman's books are, in a way, about someone trying desperately to fit into a dull, safe place and finding himself, like the shop-boy in Stardust, happy only in a crazy, dangerous one. His oeuvre spans the ""extreme sex and weirdness"" of American Gods (about a former convict travelling across the"" US with a former god) to the primal fear of the picture-book The Wolves in the Walls. He loathes the concept of the crossover book, but his richly imaginative, dark fantasies have the classic element of appealing to the adult in children and the child in adults. It is no coincidence that two of the classic children's authors he most admires are Rudyard Kipling and P. L. Travers,

the author of Mary Poppins, both of whom had a profound influence on The Graveyard Book. Gaiman had the idea for it 20 years ago, when newly married and living in a tall thin house without a garden. He'd take his toddler son across the road to ride his tricycle in the local graveyard, and the idea of a boy brought up by dead people was ""one of those wonderful, clear, perfect moments"". He wrote a page and a half before realising that he needed to learn his craft if he wasn't to waste it; grappling with it every five years until finally realising in 2002 that he ""wasn't going to get any better"". Though inspired by the atmosphere of an English graveyard, it also fits perfectly into the Gothic, post-Poe American sensibility, and is a memorable, captivating read. Pleasingly, Gaiman himself now lives in ""a huge, Addams family-style house in America, with acres of spooky woods,"" after realising in 1991 that he could buy his dream house there for the price of a one-bedroom flat in London. He moved his wife and three children to Minneapolis and has never looked back, writing the much-garlanded American Gods and becoming one of Hollywood's favourite writers. His own family, baffled by his choice of career (though always supportive) realised that he had ""finally got cool"" only after attending the premieres of Stardust and Beowulf within weeks of each other last year. The ""mad artistic one"" has, just like his heroes, come good.

A HANDBOOK ON GOOD MANNERS FOR CHILDREN De Civilitate Morum Puerilium Libellus by Erasmus trans. Eleanor Merchant WHAT DO YOU think was the world's bestselling book in the 16th century? The early Shakespeare plays, perhaps? The Bible? A royal insider's expose of the Reformation? No, it was this — a jokey, prurient little book on manners by Erasmus (1466-1536), better known as a Roman Catholic theologian and Dutch Renaissance humanist. The book, written in Latin in Freiburg in 1530, went into 130 editions over 300 years and had been translated into 22 languages within a decade of publication. You can see why it did so well. It has all the ingredients of the bestselling loo book — short, divided up into easily readable gobbets (""Silence suits a woman, and even more so a child"") and, most importantly, rude. At times, the book reads more like something out of a modern lads' mag than the words of one of the most eminent classical scholars of the
15th and 16th centuries. He is all for farting at dinner — as long as you. ""close the fert under colour of a cough"" and don't rock from buttock to buttock on your chair and reveal that you are repeatedly farting. For anyone who thinks that modern manners have gone to the dogs, this is a salutary read. Europe in the 16th century was a much dirtier and offensive place than it is today. The Spanish, Erasmus confirms, did brush their teeth with urine. Erasmus didn't do much more than wash his mouth out — ""Whitening them with fine powder is only for girls."" All this means that Erasmus's tips are pretty basic. He cautions against slovenliness at a time when young men were used to staining the hems of their shirts and tunics with urine, and plastering their chests and sleeves with crusts of phlegm. In this filthy world, real reverence was shown, not for hygiene, but for king and God, in that order. The book was written for an 11-year-old boy from the Netherlands, Henry of Burgundy, son of the Prince of Vere, and throughout Erasmus stays on the side of the blue-blooded. To get his readers to acknowledge God,

he draws on their much deeper respect for their masters: you'd be mad not to remove your cap, and bow in the presence ofthe king, wouldn't you, he says, so you should do it in church, too. For all this openness about bodily functions, though, Erasmus comes across as a bit of a snob and a killjoy. At the dinner table, he says, you mustn't gossip, talk about what you've been up to, criticise anybody else or reveal secrets. You should genuflect at the name of Jesus or the Virgin Mother, and willingly give up your seat
to someone of higher rank. And, should your bread fall on the floor, you must kiss it, in honour of the days when men treated bread with great respect. So, a night round at Erasmus's doesn't sound like much fun. But it's all very gripping to read about; partly because standards have changed so much — thank God, it's no longer outrageously rude to hold a book or a hat under your arm as it then was. A lot of etiquette has stayed the same, too — you shouldn't lick your plate (""something
cats do""), he says, although I've always thought it one of the best bits of a meal. His generalisations about manners also ring true today: ignore other people's faults but avoid falling short yourself, and always listen to your neighbour at meals.

It begins with the funeral of the malevolent ""Pappy"" McAllan, a character who would be at home in one of William Faulkner's more grisly tales. The circumstances that led up to Pappy's death are then related by several different voices — including those of his two sons, Henry and Jamie, and Henry's wife, Laura. It is Laura with whom the reader initially sympathises most, seeing the harsh landscape with its endless flat fields and utilitarian farm dwellings from her disillusioned perspective. The attraction this bored and neglected wife feels for her brother-in-law, Jamie, whose rejection of the crudely racist tenets of his upbringing sets him apart from most of the other characters, is subtly conveyed — as is Laura's growing friendship with Florence Jackson, whose husband, Hap, is a tenant farmer on the McAllan's land. When Florence's eldest son, Ronsel, returns from the war, having served in one of the army's few black battalions, it destabilises an already fragile situation, setting in motion a chain of events that can end only in disaster.

Women, one turns to Brooks' latest work with high expectations. For here are many of the elements that made the earlier book — as well as the author's bestselling debut, Year of Wonders — so readable: lovingly described set-piece scenes; a literary framework; a sympathetic narrator. This is Hanna Heath, a young Australian book restorer given the job of stabilising a fragile sacred text. Rescued from the ruins of Sarajevo after the civil war of 1996, this 15th-century Jewish prayer book — the Haggadah — is illustrated with exquisite miniatures that hold the key to the identity of their creator. Before we can get to that, there are other layers of history to be uncovered. Thus, a scrap of butterfly's wing trapped in the binding of the Haggadah unlocks a tale of partisan resistance against the Nazis; a wine stain leads to 17th-century Venice; a cat's whisker to medieval Spain and so on. While all this is enjoyable enough, it does have a somewhat laboured feel, even where the present-day love story, between Heath and Ozren, the Bosnian academic who found the manuscript, is concerned. Given the preachy tendencies evident in Brooks' previous fiction, the sentimental pieties of this work do not surprise and do nothing to dispel the overall dullness of People of the Book.

Before we can get to that, there are other layers of history to be uncovered. Thus, a scrap of the wing trapped in the binding of the Haggadah unlocks a tale of partisan resistance against the Nazis a wine stain leads to 17th- century Venice a cats whisker to medieval Spain and so on. While all this is enjoyable enough, it does have a somewhat wrong feel, even where the present- day love story, between Heath and Ozren, the Bosnian academic who found the manuscript, is concerned. Given the preachy tendencies evident in Brooks previous fiction, the sentimental job of this work do not surprise and do nothing to dispel the overall dullness of People of the Book. by Geraldine Brooks HarperPerennial, 7. 99 m 7. 59 free pp After the success of March, which won the 2006 Pulitzer prize for its account of the American Civil War as seen through the eyes of the eponymous character from Louisa May Alcotts Little"

Ystsutaka Tsutsmi
Here, a motley collection of adulterous ""salarymen"", yakuza gangsters, bestselling novelists, kabuki actors and chat show hosts are congregated to undergo penance for the crimes they have committed in their lifetimes. As with the characters in Flann O'Brien's The Third Policeman, they have to relive these catastrophic events many times. For Izumi, a businessman, it is the moment when he finds his wife Sachiko in bed with his colleague, Takeshi, that he must repeatedly confront. For Yuzo, a teenage thug, it is the moment of his murder he must undergo time and again. Gangsters eternally torture their victims; actors eternally suffer terrible stage fright; planes are hijacked again and again; people endlessly die in car crashes. In this cycle of eternal recurrence, the dead are virtually indistinguishable from the living and, indeed, are fully aware of being dead. Their cartoon-like indestructibility makes it hard to sympathise with Tsutsui's characters — but one's sympathy, in any case, is not required. (The slapstick humour adds to the sense of dislocation, as does the constant shifting between past and present. The result certainly gives an impression of what Hell might be like — if only through the mixture of unease, revulsion and boredom that it creates in the reader.

As Springwatch returns to BBC Two on Monday, Derwent May grabs his butterfly net and deerstalker to go in search of the finest new nature books
M WATSON/ARDEA; DAVID TIPLING/PHOTOLIBRARY * Nature in all its glory, clockwise from far left: amatungula and morning glory; flamingos in flight; robins enjoy a good reputation in print Below: a Great Crested Grebe
IF KATE HUMBLE is once again trying to curb Bill Oddie's bubbling erotic imagination, it must be spring — or at any rate it must be Springwatch on BBC Two. Either way, it is a timely moment to see what new nature books are in the shops. Starting at the garden door, Dominic Couzens has written a sequel to his RSPB book Secret Lives of Garden Birds, this one called Secret Lives of Garden Wildlife (Helm, £14.99/offer £13.49). So this time we do not get birds from the RSPB, but plenty of entertaining tales of other creatures — male spiders strumming tunes on female spiders' webs, foxes going crazy over shoes left in the garden, and hedgehogs regularly tossing a coat of spittle over their spines with their tongue, for a reason no zoologist has ever been able to explain. David Lack, the great ornithologist who was the first expert on robin behaviour, also compiled a little literary anthology called Robin Redbreast. His son, Andrew Lack, has expanded this into a longer book with a shorter title, Redbreast (SMH, £19.95/no discount), and has found some wonderful robins, mainly in poetry. They are mostly seen as good birds. There are several accounts of them covering the babes in the wood with leaves — one with good colour sense using strawberry leaves. Other robins comfort prisoners — or unhappy monks — at their cell windows. Ted Hughes gives his robin a ""flaming shirt"". Emily Bronte puts her finger on a paradox of the robin's song when she calls it ""wildly tender"" (just like her novel?), while Edward
Thomas brings out another paradox when he writes of the robin's ""sad songs of autumn mirth"". A new identification book to birds, by Marc Duquet, is called Birds By Colour (Helm, £12.99/£11.69). Wild flower guides are often arranged by colour, so why not birds? This one sets about the task imaginatively, with categories such as ""Birds with a black throat"" and ""Birds with a black cheek"". The only problem is that one cannot hold birds in the hand like flowers, so one may not even notice these features. Also, birds can look very different colours in different lights. Black crows can even look white when sunlight bounces off them. Nevertheless a good try, with good pictures. Where do all the flowers in our gardens come from? An excellent new book, Flower Hunters by Mary and John Gribbin (Oxford, £16.99/£15.29), tells the story of 11 botanists who travelled far in search of new flowers and trees. Joseph Banks went with Captain Cook on his first voyage round the world, and Botany Bay was named by Cook in honour of all the plants that Banks found there, including mimosas, acacias and eucalyptus. Banks also discovered jasmines and gardenias in Tahiti. Others include Joseph Hooker, who found rhododendrons and

magnolias in the Himalayas, and David Douglas, who after nightmarish adventures in the North American snow sent back the first seeds of the Douglas fir to Europe. The Gribbins also include the great Swede, Linnaeus, who as a boy was already making lists of his toys. He travelled for new plants only as far as Lapland, but his mind travelled around the whole plant creation, setting up a classification that endures to this day. He also made a flower clock, with the opening and closing of the different flowers telling the time — and this book tells us how to do it.

This is the Mascarene Islands, which consist of Mauritius, Reunion and Rodrigues. It is where, at the end of the 16th century, Europeans found the dodo, that strange, flightless bird, and where before the end of the 17th century it was extinct. Probably the main culprits were the pigs, introduced by the Dutch, that ate its eggs. But many other creatures have vanished from the islands since then, including the giant tortoises that the settlers ate, and this scholarly book gives a full, devastating account of them. There are delightful paintings by Julian Hume of other extinct birds — such as the raven parrot, Commerson's lizard-owl and the pigeon hollandais. This book also gives a moving and instructive account of what is being done to save the wildlife still found on the islands.

ON FEBRUARY 17,1952, Ian Fleming sat down at his desk at Goldeneye, his house in Jamaica, and gazed out at the unbroken Caribbean Sea. He was a 43-year-old journalist, and he was trying hard to take his mind off his imminent wedding. Putting a fresh sheet of paper in the battered Royal portable in front of him, using six fingers he typed out a sentence. He crossed it out and tried again. Discarding that too, he finally came up with ""The scent and smoke and sweat of a casino are nauseating at three in the morning"". Suddenly he was off, writing in a fast, uninhibited manner and by lunch he had already typed 2,000 words. These were pulled straight from his memory and imagination,
he had no notes, no plan of where he was going. Fleming claimed he had even found the name of his hero by chance: A Field Guide to the Birds of the West Indies, by a certain James Bond, was sitting on his bookshelf. Every morning for a month he stuck to this iron regime, until he hammered out the final bitter sentence: ""The bitch is dead now."" Casino Royale, his first novel, was finished, and the phenomenon of James Bond was born. For the next dozen years Fleming would repeat the pattern of writing a new Bond novel between January and March at Goldeneye, to be published in the spring of the following year. What he had begun
""chiefly for pleasure, and then money"", quickly developed into a long-running saga, in which each book picked up where the last one left off, and Fleming occasionally felt obliged to tie up some of the loose ends of the previous adventure (particularly what happens to the girls) before sending Bond off on his next assignment. ""Everything I write has a precedent in truth,"" Fleming once said, and this is true not only of his fantastic plots and locations but also of his alter ego, 007.

Natural World BBC Two, 8pm
In the autumn of 1893, during the twilight years of the Wild West, a hunter and amateur naturalist called Ernest Thompson Seton rode into New Mexico to wipe out wolves, which he regarded as cattle killers. His mission turned into a battle of wits between himself and one particular wolf called Lobo, who outwitted him at every turn. But it became much more than a battle between hunter and hunted. Seton underwent a conversion; he later wrote a bestselling book about his encounter with Lobo, which changed the attitude of the American public towards the natural world, kickstarted the conservation movement and inspired the ten-year-old David Attenborough. It is a wonderful story.

But it is the girls who provide all the entertainment Their team leader announces, without the slightest hint of irony, that she has been ""hugely successful in a tough sales background"".

But if you've had the jabs and you're not bothered that this new eight-part series follows an entirely random itinerary, there are plenty of wonders to behold. In the opening programme,
he helps to build an igloo (""an ancient, elemental and beautiful structure"") in Greenland; he sees the 70m-high statue of the Buddha of Le Shan (""Golly! He's absolutely enormous!""); he relishes the 13th-century Sun Temple at Konarak on the east coast of India, decorated with erotic statues ""feasting on the divine nectar"", and he admires the gaunt and terrifying cathedral-fortress of Albi in France. But to enjoy the series, you have to be able to cope with Dan.

In the opening room, he helps to build an igloo an ancient, elemental and beautiful structure in Greenland he sees the 70m- high statue of the Buddha of Le Shan Golly! Hes absolutely enormous! he relishes the 13th- century Sun Temple at Konarak on the east coast of India, decorated with erotic statues feasting on the divine nectar, and he admires the gaunt and terrifying cathedral- fortress of Albi of Albi in France. But to enjoy the series, you have to be able to cope with Dan. Dexter ITVl, 10. 35pm It cant be healthy enough with a psychotic serial killer, any more than it is healthy to cherish nuggets of wisdom from a series that delights in being fundamentally ghoulish. But then this little corner of The Times has never exactly been a bastion of mental health. At the beginning of the episode, Dexter says Life is so fleeting, so fragile. Every breath has the potential to be our last. And by the end, he has seen another truth. I know now that my days are numbered, he says, so I had better make the most of them. So whether you get lessons in mindfulness from Buddhist teaching or primetime ITV, occasionally very occasionally they can amount to the same thing."

lain Banks returns with his family saga The Steep Approach to Garbadale, next week's specially priced novel
THE BOOK In 1992 lain Banks wrote what some consider to be the ultimate modern family saga, The Crow Road, later adapted into a successful four-part television series. But here, in his 12th ""mainstream"" novel (he also writes sci-fi under the name lain M. Banks), he returns to the fertile ground of familial drama and intrigue.
The Steep Approach to Garbadale centres around the Wopuld family, creators of the bestselling boardgame Empire! — which has since gone through several incarnations since the 19th century, including the apologetic Commonwealth after the Second World War and the disastrous Seventies spin-off Karma! Alban is the black sheep of the family, but
he is brought back into the fold for a momentous meeting at the Wopulds' Highlands castle, Garbadale House. Will they sell out to the smooth-talking American Spraint Corp, or keep Empire! in the clan? Alban and his cousin Fielding are trying to persuade their relatives not to sell, but the waters are muddied by mixed motives and unsettling discoveries, and Alban can't push on until he has shaken off his childhood obsession with cousin Sophie, or found out the truth about his mother's suicide. With an attractively sharp-tongued protagonist and a corkscrew plot, Steep Approach finds Banks in his element.

William Blake is brought to life in next week's specially priced novel, Burning Bright by Tracy Chevalier
THE BOOK In her bestselling historical novel The Girl With the Pearl Earring, Chevalier painted a vivid picture of 17th-century Holland and its inhabitants (specifically the artist Vermeer and his servant Griet) - now she has given the same meticulous treatment to 18th-century London, and another celebrated artist - the
visionary poet, engraver and printer William Blake. The novel focuses on the troubled Kellaway family, who, still mourning their dead son Tommy, move from rural Dorset to a cramped and clamorous city caught up in two revolutions — industrial and French. In Lambeth the youngest Kellaway boy, Jem, strikes up a friendship with streetwise Maggie. They soon
t
discover that they have a most unusual neighbour — a man who recites Paradise Lost naked in the garden and talks to the ghost of his dead brother. The lives of the children and the poet become entwined and gradually they learn from each other: as Jem and Maggie mature, Blake composes the second half of what was to become his most famous work, Songs of Innocence and Experience. The children talk of Heaven and Hell, and Jem wonders ""Can't there be something that's more a bit of both?"" ""That's the world, Jem,"" Maggie replies. It's a world that Burning Bright illuminates with clarity and beauty.

Noughts & Crosses Civic Hall, Stratford-upon-Avon • **##
SAM MARLOWE Here's some stirring theatre to counter the fake snow and sugar of Christmas — or Crossmas, as the festival is renamed in this play's dystopia. In her bestselling book for young people, the author Malorie Blackman creates a society divided in two: the privileged Crosses, and the underclass, the noughts (not dignfied by a capital). Crosses despise and fear ""the blankers""; noughts hate and envy ""the daggers"". The Crosses are black; the noughts are white. Can a childhood friendship between a Cross girl and a nought boy survive as they grow up among so much pain and anger? Blackman's book is double-edged,
both cutting and crude. Her conceit impels the reader to reimagine social history, and her story, a brutal, pacy reworking of Romeo and Juliet, is gripping. Yet her prose style is self-conscious and cluttered with cliche. That shortcoming is apparent in the dialogue of Dominic Cooke's stage adaptation, and the play's climactic scenes feel rushed. But Cooke's production is fluid and vigorous. The burgeoning illicit love affair between high-ranking politician's daughter Sephy (short for Persephone) and frustrated, ambitious Callum is the lens that brings into focus inequalities that recall apartheid South Africa, pre-civil-rights America, the Troubles in Northern Ireland, even today's multicultural Britain. The attempt by a handful of nought children to attend Sephy's school results in a riot; Sephy is beaten up by fellow female Cross pupils when

she sits at the noughts' table in the canteen; Callum's brother and father become radicalised and join a terrorist movement. Division becomes internalised in the individual, with Callum experiencing self-disgust and Sephy shamed by Cross bigotry and by her own unconscious absorption of racist language.
Kandis Cook's sparse design of wheeled furniture and Liz Ranken's movement, by turns staccato and slow-motion, enhance the sense of a society without firm foundations and in peril of toppling into violence. The acting is sometimes overearnest, but Richard Madden and Ony Uhiara as Callum and Sephy make you invest in their
doomed passion, while Michelle Butterly and Phil McKee impress as Callum's helpless and beleaguered parents.

THE STUFF OF THOUGHT Language as a Window Into Human Nature by Steven Pinker IN THE PIVOTAL chapter of this complex but often revelatory book about the links between language and human nature, Steven Pinker quotes from Madame Bovary, in which Flaubert wrote that ""language is a cracked kettle on which we beat out tunes for bears to dance to, while all the time we long to move the stars to pity"". Not only is this a beautiful metaphor on the limits of language, but it highlights a central theme of Pinker's work. Amazing though language is in its complexity and subtlety, it is a construct ofthe human mind, making it a subjective and incomplete device for describing the world. It can, however, provide incredible insight into how the mind works, who we are and how our intelligence has developed over millions of years, which is exactly what Pinker lucidly argues here. Pinker is well known as a bestselling science writer, and has big ambitions for this book. The Stuff of Thought is intended as the third part of not one, but two trilogies. In tackling the interface between how we speak and who we are, he hopes that this book will
conclude both his previous work on the theories of language (T7ie Language Instinct and Words and Rules) and on human nature (How the Mind Works and The Blank Slate). It's a big ask, but Pinker pulls it off with aplomb. This is, essentially, a book of two halves. In the opening chapters, Pinker outlines his theories of ""conceptual semantics"" — the collection of concepts held in our mind and the way that they are combined in thoughts. How thoughts are expressed through language, he argues, is entirely dependent on how we experience the world, and how human beings have evolved. Dealing rather technically with concepts of space, time, causality and sub'So often, we don't mean what we say at all' stance, he meticulously picks apart rival theories, putting forward a complex but coherent argument of his own. This might be heavy going for those of a non-scientific or non-linguistic bent, but Pinker tries to keep things fairly light, peppering his prose with examples and quirks, paradoxes and counter-intuitive examples. So, in between referencing everyone from Shakespeare to Monty Python, we find out whether George Bush really did lie about his reasons for invading Iraq, why we say ""underwater"" when we mean ""in water"", and whether the ter-
rorist attack on the World Trade Centre constitutes one or two ""events"" (if you think that's trivial or ""mere semantics"", think again — $3.5 billion (£1.75 billion) was at stake in an insurance lawsuit). But halfway through, when the author tackles metaphor, things really take off. The Flaubert quote"" is a fine example, but that's not what primarily concerns Pinker. Instead he deals with ""conceptual metaphors"" which are all-pervasive in language and so embedded in everything we say that we don't even notice them. Think how many phrases refer to love as a journey — ""we're at a crossroads"", ""our marriage is on the rocks"", ""it's been a long, bumpy road"". This applies across the board, from concepts of political allegiance being compared to physical bonds, to intellectual argument being compared to an act of war. Through this process, Pinker argues, a multitude of abstract concepts are expressed through more concrete experiences. He proves it by pulling apart a section ofthe US Declaration of Independence. This ability to frame complex ideas in simpler terms has been crucial in the evolution of human intelligence, yet it leads to inevitable conflict. If everything we say or think depends on how we frame it metaphorically in our minds and language, then ""ending a pregnancy"" and ""killing an unborn child"" are both valid ways to refer to abortion. But this innate human ability to use metaphor in such a creative way also enabled us to develop scientific theories, legal struc-

tures and political systems. After this profound passage, Pinker lightens things up a little. The subsequent chapters deal with the nature and process of naming things, the concept of obscenity and swearing. There is much fun to be had among all this. If someone has been impersonating Paul McCartney for the past 40 years, what do we really mean when we invoke the name ""Paul McCartney""? Why are there gaps in our lexicon, such as no single term for grown-up children, or a collective term for one's nieces and nephews? Why did ""internet"" stick as a word, when ""infobahn"" didn't? Similarly, the discourse on the reasons for swearing and the rather odd idea of taboo subjects and words makes highly entertaining reading. While not strictly central to Pinker's overarching themes, the examination of the unique linguistic
oddity that is ""fuck you"" is funny and thought-provoking. Finally, as Pinker rounds off this perceptive, amusing and intelligent book, he examines how so much of what we say is nothing like what we mean. From sarcasm to diplomacy, sexual advances to bribes, politeness to insults, it is revealed that our language — even when used obliquely — can provide deep insights into the human condition.

THE BRITISH BOOK AWARDS Channel 4, 8pm
On the shortlist for the Book of the Year are two very different titles: Peter Kay's The Sound of Laughter (which went on to become the bestselling autobiography in the UK) and Professor Richard Dawkins's anti-religious polemic The God Delusion. The judges will be praying for divine guidance. There is an unusual entrant in this year's best biography category, with the memoirs of a labrador puppy competing with those of an ubiquitous chef. Ricky Gervais has been nominated for the children's book award with Flanimals of the Deep, while William Boyd and Griff Rhys Jones are on the shortlist for the lucrative Richard & Judy's Best Read of the Year award. All in all, a great night for dogs, comedians and book-lovers.

GORDON BROWN MEETS THE TEN-YEAR-OLDS/ THE TEN DEMANDMENTS/ I BLAME THE SPICE GIRLS! Five, 7.30pm/8pm/9pm
p/p/p Five's tenth anniversary celebrations continue with more programmes involving the number ten. (One of those

The evening gets off to a promising start, with Gordon Brown being cross-examined by a group of ten-year-olds in a show hosted by Kirsty Young. It's hard to imagine all that Presbyterian gravitas trying to be cuddly, but presumably that's the idea. This is followed by a programme in which ten-year-old Abby (below left) lays down the law, introducing rules (or ""demandments"") by which her family has to abide. Finally, in / Blame the Spice Girls!, two teams of comedians show their knowledge of ""amazing moments"" from ten years of Five. It's a short programme.

Conn and Hal Iggulden
PUBLISHED IN JUNE (a week before Father's Day — providing a hint as to its real readership), The Dangerous Book for Boys is the publishing sensation of the year. It leapt into the Amazon top ten, generating enough column inches to take you to the Moon and back (possibly — my maths is a bit rusty). It has hardly been out ofthe bestsellers chart since. If you've been stuck down a mineshaft all year, you might need me to tell you that The Dangerous Book for Boys is an old-fashioned compendium of proper skills (tying a bowline knot), hardy activities (building a tree house), useful knowledge (Latin phrases ""every boy should know"") and classic tales of derring-do (the Battle of Trafalgar), lovingly compiled by the brothers Iggulden. Its success was a case of a great idea and even better timing. Children's movements seem subject to increasing surveillance (and intervention) from the risk-assessment mavens. Last year the Lord Chancellor lamented the fact that a ""culture of fear of being sued"" was ""stopping good activities"". This year a feature about ""cotton-wool kids"" in The Times quoted a sociologist's observations that in 1971 almost every 11-year-old child was allowed to walk to school alone; now the figure is 55 per cent and falling, even though there are no more child murders than in the 1970s — and far fewer traffic accidents. The Iggulden brothers' beautifully produced red-andgold hardback looks back further than the 1970s to the age of The Boy's Own Paper and Baden-Powell. The tone is set by the opening quotation, solid advice from Sir Frederick Treves, written in 1903: ""Trust... to hard work, perseverance, and determination... Don't swagger... Be honest.
Be loyal. Be kind... Keep clean, body and mind."" The essential message applies as much to office-bound adults as to pre-teen Xbox-addicts: whatever you do, don't spend your life in front of a screen. As explained in the section ""Advice about girls"", if nothing else, the opposite sex will be put off: ""Play sport of some kind. It doesn't matter what it is, as long as it replaces the corpse-like pallor of the computer programmer with a ruddy glow."" This is not an advocation of brawn over brains,

Suite Frangaise Irene NeillirOVSky (translated by Sandra Smith)
RARE FOR A BOOK that tells an extraordinary story to have an extraordinary story behind it, but that is the case with Irene Nemirovsky's Suite Frangaise. This work — in a lucid, elegant translation by Sandra Smith — would, for its literary quality alone, be a highlight of any year; the story of its discovery makes it more remarkable still. Contained by the covers of Suite Frangaise sre two novels of a projected five, a chronicle of lives in Occupied France. Nemirovksy, born in Russia in 1903, fled in 1918 and settled in France. In 1926 she married Michel Epstein, a Russian emigre, and although both were Jewish they were, in 1939, baptised in the Catholic Church. By that time Nemirovksy was a bestselling novelist. Neither that nor her conversion, however, could save her from what was to come. In 1942 the Nazis informed the Vichy Government that France's Jews were to be sent ""to the East"". By that time the family — the couple and their two daughters, Denise and Elisabeth — had left Paris for the village of Issy-L'Eveque in Burgundy, and Nemirovksy had
begun work on Suite Frangaise. ""All the time we were in that village, I just remember mother writing, writing, writing,"" Denise said decades later. She was writing, she knew, against time: she was arrested in July and died a month later, in Auschwitz; Michel was also deported and died that year. Their daughters escaped — told by the gendarme who arrested their father to flee. Denise took a small suitcase (pictured) that contained the leather binder holding Suite Frangaise, but did not look at it, or begin to transcribe her mother's minuscule writing until nearly 30 years later. More years would pass before she decided that publication was not a betrayal of her mother. It was published in France by Editions Denoel; in The Times, Carmen Callil noted that its founder was the most enthusiastic of French publisher collaborators. The book was hailed as a masterpiece: one ""ripped from oblivion"", Le Monde said. Callil —the author of a biography of Louis Darquier, commissioner for Jewish affairs in the Vichy regime — praised the prose, ""lucid, bright, like one ofthe lit-
tie brown birds she so often describes. She misses nothing, not a blossom, a hen nor a bumblebee. Such acute insight means that her characters are full of life and diversity, as are the animals she so tellingly describes... Nemirovksy's embodiment of the people of France, suffering 'as birds must feel when hawks circle above them'. No other work of fiction as forcefully conveys the fate of France under the Nazis."" The danger is that such history might put some readers off Suite Frangaise. Yet, while it is in no way light reading, it moves swiftly and is tender and — perhaps surprisingly — funny. It is too easy to look at photographs of refugees and see them simply as a mass of unimaginable humanity; Nemirovksy brings her characters — the self-important writer, the humble bank clerk, the worn-down but proud wife — to vivid individual life. Masterpiece is a word overused; and often wrongly. For a living writer it could be seen as marking an end. Here, it is all too appropriate: we will hear no more from Irene Nemirovksy, but Suite Frangaise ensures that her name will endure. Her body died in a concentration camp; her soul and mind survive.

THE FORESHADOWING by Marcus Sedgwick Orion, £5.99 El £5.69 (free p&p) Sasha Fox, a young woman growing up in England in 1917, is already haunted by her ability to see death before it happens. Her life takes a drastic turnwhen she is forced to foresee the death of someone she loves, and, as her brothers are swallowed into the current wartime effort in France, tragedy ensues. In an act of desperation, she too ventures to the front line. Throughout her journey, she pretends to be a nurse, faces the devastation of war and befriends the mysterious Hoodoo Jack. Amongst all the chaos she never forgets her vocation, dodging death and suspicion as she goes. This book will keep you hooked on every page, and concludes with a heart-stopping twist. You can't help but admire Sasha, as she attempts the unthinkable, in her own war against fate and destiny. EXCHANGE by Paul Magrs Simon & Schuster, £9.99 m £9.49 (free p&p) Simon is 16 years old. After the death of his mother and father, he ends up miles away, living with his grandparents. Tormented by local yobs and by the constant memories of all he has lost, he longs for escape. Seemingly out of nowhere appears the ""Great Big Book Exchange"", along with Kelly and Terrance, who begin to play large roles in both his and his grandmother's lives. Over time, the book exchange becomes more than just a shop, offering an opportunity for Simon to escape from his current life and for his grandmother to return to her past ■This story reminds you why people love to read books, as well as why people long to write them. It gives us the comfort that no matter how things change, there will always be something to link the generations.
THEO TEMPLE 14
HENRY TUMOUR by Anthony McGowan Doubleday, £10.99 m £9.99 (free p&p) Definitely the funniest, most obscenely wise book I have read in a long time. Henry Tumour, Anthony McGowan's second novel for teenagers, is written from the point of view of Hector Brunty, a teenager who likes maths (?), whose mum is an ageing hippy and whose brain has been invaded by a chatty alter-ego called Henry T. Everything seems to be against Hector — even the comfort of his own thoughts have been taken over. However, this little clump of brain cells seems to be able to help him out. Soon, Henry T. is giving Hector tips on fashion and snogging tactics; Hector seems to have risen to the schoolbreak elite (if only for a short while). But how far will Henry T. go and how far will Hector let him before they both go under the knife? BEAST by Ally Kennen Marion Lloyd Books, £6.99 m £6.64 (free p&p) This book reminds me of possible sequel to that famous book (and film) Kes. The plot is full of twists and turns. Stephen, who is 17 years old, and coming to the end of his time in care, tries to get rid of the ""beast"" he keeps in a cage at a nearby reservoir. The creature's needs take control of Stephen's life as he struggles to find hunks of meat to feed its ferocious appetite. Kennen has captured magnificently the love-hate relationship that exists between Stephen and the beast. Stephen has a bleak background and appears to have few prospects yet, by the end of the book, he becomes more of a hero — freeing himself and taking back control. If you like cheeky, realistic stories about people who aren't all that law-abiding, then this book is for you.
s> & **• ISABELLE ELLIS COCKROFT 15
A SWIFT PURE CRY by Siobhan Dowd David Pickling Books, £12.99 m £11.69 (free p&p) Since the death of Shell's mam, her father has lost touch with reality, leaving 15-yearold Shell to bring up her two younger siblings. Shell's parents were religious but, after the death of her mam, Shell lost her faith. When a new priest, Father Rose, comes to the small Irish town of Coolbar something extraordinary shifts in Shell's world and her mam's spirit seems to return to Earth. Then tragedy shakes Shell's life and she is swept up in^to the heart of a scandal that reverberates across the country. It takes all her courage just to carry on. This story is told with perfectly chosen phrases and words for every moment, lifting the story off the page and fashioning the fresh vivid imagery from which this heartwrenching story is woven.
RHONA CLARK 15
ANGEL BLOOD by John Singleton Puffin, £9.99 El £9.49 (free p&p) This is the story of four children — X-Ray, Cough Cough, Lights Out and Chicken Wings — and their life in the ""Bin"", a place for special children. It is written from the X- Ray's point of view, and chronicles how their life in the Bin deteriorates after the dastardly Dr Dearly and his team of unfriendly staff take over. An unexpected twist is added with the introduction of Nail, a hard man with his own story to tell, and his girlfriend, Natalie. Eventually, they escape with the help of Nail and Natalie. But after spending all their lives in the secure, sterile Bin will they be able to survive on the outside? This is an innovative, bittersweet book which not only tells the story of four children's struggle to reach the outside world but also of how the outside world views them.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0503488003/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=51effc93,"Books Discover this years best books for teenagers The Booktrust Teenage Prize rewards the best in teen fiction.

If you like cheeky, realistic stories about people who are all that law- abiding, then this book is for you. s ISABELLE ELLIS COCKROFT 15 A SWIFT PURE CRY by Siobhan Dowd David Pickling Books, 12. 99 m 11. 69 free pp Since the death of Shells mam, her father has lost touch with reality, leaving 15- year Shell to bring up her two younger siblings. Shells parents were religious but, after the death of her mam, Shell lost her faith. When a new priest, Father Rose, comes to the small Irish town of Coolbar something extraordinary shifts in Shells world and her mams spirit seems to return to Earth. Then tragedy shakes Shells life and she is swept up into the heart of a scandal that reverberates across the country. It takes all her courage just to carry on. This story is told with perfectly chosen phrases and words for every moment, lifting the story off the page and fashioning the fresh vivid imagery from which this the story is woven. RHONA CLARK 15 ANGEL BLOOD by John Singleton Puffin, 9. 99 El 9. 49 free pp This is the story of four children X- Ray, Cough Cough, Lights Out and Chicken Wings and their life in the Bin, a place for special children. It is written from the X- Rays point of view, and chronicles how their life in the Bin deteriorates after the dastardly Dr Dearly and his team of unfriendly staff take over. An unexpected twist is added with the introduction of Nail, a hard man with his own story to tell, and his girlfriend, Natalie. Eventually, they escape with the help of Nail and Natalie. But after spending all their lives in the secure, sterile Bin will they be able to survive on the outside? This is an innovative, bittersweet book which not only tells the story of four the struggle to reach the outside world but also of how the outside world views them."

WHAT DO ADOLF HITLER, MARY Whitehouse, Jimmy Greaves and Dick Emery have in common? Probably quite a lot if you do enough research, but the immediate answer is that all of them coexist quite happily up on my bookshelves. Moreover, they share a heritage particularly common on my bookshelves, which is that I have no memory of how they got there. Ooh You Were Awful ...But I Like You — the life story of Dick Emery as told to his — count 'em — sixth wife, Fay Hillier — has a reduced sticker from a shop called The Works on it (£15.99 down to £10, then to a further £4.99) and I do have a very vague memory of once being in The Works looking at remaindered books; but actually taking this one to the till, getting the fiver out of my wallet, and rushing home to read Fay's superbly detailed biog of the great man (if a little cursory, perhaps, on the subject of Dick's other five wives) — that's gone. Similarly, I noticed Jimmy Greaves's The Heart of The Game sitting by itself — as if picked out in a Waterstone's recommendation — on my shelves last week, but — perhaps like Jimmy in his drinking days — have no memory of how exactly it ended up there. The Mary Whitehouse book is a tome entitled Whatever Happened to Sex? I'd assumed it was a cri de coeur about the author's personal life, the answer to which, I have to say, is provided by the photo of Mary on the back — but it is, in fact, a learned argument against the permissive society, which, judging from the state of the cover, I rushed out and bought immediately on its publication in 1977, presumably in between buying a new protractor and Never Mind the Bollocks. But I have no memory of doing so. Hitler is a slightly different kettle offish, as I do remember buying most of my Nazi/ Holocaust books, some of which I've had for a while, others that came during the writing of my last novel, set during the war — but what I don't remember is the moment at which these went beyond the standard legal requirement for a North London Jew and became a full-on Hitler/Holocaust library section. Surely there was a moment when I thought: ""Hold on... is this becoming a bit creepy? Am I going to be contacted any minute by Stormfront's book club?"" But clearly not. It's one of the functions, I think, of being a bit bookish. The fact is, I buy a lot of books, on impulse, I get sent a lot of books, and I hardly ever throw out books — taking the Nazi

AS MY COLLEAGUE NEXT DOOR points out, summer vacation, as I used to call it, is nearly over. What that calls to mind for me is not only the books that I might read in the autumn, as Jeanette suggests, but the lists we used to have to keep in the holidays ofthe books we'd read when we weren't at school. If memory serves, our teachers handed out a list, and you were supposed to choose at least a few from there, then you were on your own. I don't do that any more, but perhaps I'll start again. I have been inspired by a book that just landed on my desk: The Reader, it's called, and underneath that it says: ""Ali Smith"". It doesn't say ""by"", because it isn't; it is, rather, ""the first in a series of anthologies of favourite writing chosen by writers"". And it is a real treat.

It opens with Jack Burns, aged 4, travelling with his mother Alice, a tattoo artist, in search of his philandering father, William, who has abandoned them both. The best thing about this part of the novel — which moves from Edinburgh, where Jack is conceived, through various European cities, to the red-light district in Amsterdam — is its description of the tattooist's art. Irving is nothing if not thorough, at his research. Jack's schooldays at a Toronto girls' school where he is the only boy are described in similar detail, as is his deflowering by an older woman. Later he becomes a cross-dressing actor, then a Hollywood film-star. He meets more thrillingly assertive women. His mother gets cancer and dies. Finally he tracks down his father. All these developments are given exactly the same weight, and are depicted in exactly the same dull prose.

His gradual realisation that abandoning the family for his young mistress may have triggered Abbie's extremism is powerfully conveyed. With novels of this type, written with Hollywood adaptation in mind, there is always a danger that sentimentality will prevail. Unfortunately that is the case with the ending here, in which the warring parents are reconciled, surviving family members affirm their love for each other and the horrors of what went before are swept under the carpet.

WHITE HEAT A History of Britain in the Swinging Sixties by Dominic Sandbrook SEVENTIES The Sights, Sounds and Ideas of a Brilliant Decade by Howard Sounes SELF-CONFIDENT revisionism and an eagerness to challenge conventional wisdom usually make for lively history. These two highly readable books prove the point. In his compelling narrative of Britain during the 1960s, Dominic Sandbrook demolishes the myth that traditional society was swept aside by a flower power, free love and student unrest. In reality, he argues, most of the country remained deeply conservative throughout the decade with the supposed social revolution taking place largely in the lifestyles of an affluent, selfregarding metropolitan elite. The imagery of the Beatles and mini-skirts, of Concorde and LSD, now part of our national folk memory, is actually only a small part of a much more complex, often depressing, story. A more daring, if narrower thesis is pursued by Howard Sounes, whose remarkably catholic output includes biographies of Bob Dylan and the serial killers Fred and Rosemary West. Although the 1970s now tend to be regarded as a cultural wasteland, dominated by kitsch pop music, vulgar entertainment and disastrous fashions, Sounes claims that it was actually an age of astonishing creativity, especially in cinema. According to Sounes, many of the films, buildings, books and paintings produced then have stood the test the test of time far better than the art works of less despised eras. For too long, he says, the brilliance of the 1970s has been ignored, since these years tend ""to be dismissed a silly, jokey interlude between the Beatles and the 1980s"". Because of the strength of its historical research and its placing of culture in a wider historical context, Dominic Sandbrook's case is made more effectively. Sounes is excellent on many icons of the Seventies, such as the movies of Woody Allen or the music of Lou Reed, but refuses to engage in
K SS a ;, w.
anything but the most superficial discussion of the important political developments that shaped this turbulent decade. Harold Wilson is mentioned just twice, Jim Callaghan once and Ted Heath not at all, yet movements such as punk rock or the comedy of Monty Python owed much to a sense of anger or absurdity at the remorseless decline of Britain under this trio. In contrast to the limited, sometimes idiosyncratic, range of Sounes's book, Sandbrook's could hardly be more impressive in its scope. He writes with authority and an eye for telling detail on every subject he covers, be it the musical influences on Paul McCartney or the tactical

approach of the World Cupwinning manager Alf Ramsey, the crisis over the devaluation of the pound or the start of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Although the awesome depth of his knowledge is obvious, he is never ponderous. Every chapter is enlivened by humour — in describing the establishment of pirate radio stations in the North Sea, he says that the ""the disc jockeys themselves cultivated a youthful, cheeky classless style that was only occasionally interrupted by bouts of seasickness"". He is particularly funny on the ridiculous earnestness of avant-garde theatre, recounting an incident in 1964 when a group of actors were carrying out an experimental play at a small theatre in London, involving bottom-baring, wet
fish, polythene bags and the flogging of a policeman. Suddenly the theatre's caretaker burst on to the stage to complain that one of the actors had left the tap running in the dressing room. The pretentious audience took this to be part of the show. ""I think you're the best thing in the entire evening, a most interesting performance,"" one said to the caretaker afterwards. Despite his subtitle, Sandbrook's central theme is that Britain did not really swing at all in the 1960s. Contrary to the myths about sexual freedom and progressive youth, Sandbrook points out that in 1968 two thirds of women were still virgins on their wedding night, Engelbert Humperdinck was more popular than the Beatles, and opinion polls showed that young people held even more reactionary attitudes towards hanging and immigration than their elders. Far from being filled with optimism, for most people the Sixties was a time of economic stagnation, as the Wilson Government limped from one crisis to another. The stench of failure hung over most government initiatives. Attempts to reform trade unions, establish state control of economic planning, maintain the value of sterling or bring democracy to Rhodesia all ended in humiliation. Wilson himself is the supreme symbol of this failure. The dynamic, popular figure of 1964 had been reduced by 1969 to a paranoid, exhausted wreck, loathed by the public and colleagues alike for his duplicity and self-delusion. It is impossible not to be struck by the parallels between Wilson and Tony Blair, another youthful, electionwinning Labour leader who came into power on a programme of modernisation but
achieved little beyond building a reputation for slipperiness, cronyism, gimmickry and empty rhetoric. In supporting his belief that the Seventies were uniquely rich, Sounes has assembled some fascinating material, much from his own original research. He opens with a description of a critical scene from the quintessentiaJ'y 1970s film, Five Easy Pieces. Directed by Bob Rafelson and starring Jack Nicholson, it heralded a quirky, naturalistic style that moved away from the slick Hollywood productions of the past. With some justification, Sounes argues that a host of groundbreaking films such as Nashville, American Graffiti, Annie Hall and A Clockwork Orange left a lasting imprint on our collective consciousness.

These two highly readable books prove the point. In his compelling narrative of Britain during the 1960s, Dominic Sandbrook demolishes the myth that traditional society was swept aside by a flower power, free love and student unrest. In reality, he argues, most of the country remained deeply conservative throughout the decade with the supposed social revolution taking place largely in the lifestyles of an affluent, the metropolitan elite. The imagery of the Beatles and mini- skirts, of Concorde and LSD, now part of our national folk memory, is actually only a small part of a much more complex, often depressing, story. A more daring, if narrower thesis is pursued by Howard Sounes, whose remarkably catholic output includes biographies of Bob Dylan and the serial killers Fred and Rosemary West. Although the 1970s now tend to be regarded as a cultural wasteland, dominated by kitsch pop music, vulgar entertainment and disastrous fashions, Sounes claims that it was actually an age of astonishing creativity, especially in cinema. According to Sounes, many of the films, buildings, books and paintings produced then have stood the test the test of time far better than the art works of less despised eras. For too long, he says, the brilliance of the 1970s has been ignored, since these years tend to be dismissed a silly, jokey interlude between the Beatles and the 1980s. Because of the strength of its historical research and its placing of culture in a wider historical context, Dominic Sandbrooks case is made more effectively. Sounes is excellent on many icons of the Seventies, such as the movies of Woody Allen or the music of Lou Reed, but refuses to engage in K SS a , w. anything but the most superficial discussion of the important political developments that shaped this turbulent decade. Harold Wilson is mentioned just twice, Jim Callaghan once and Ted Heath not at all, yet movements such as punk rock or the comedy of Monty Python owed much to a sense of anger or absurdity at the remorseless decline of Britain under this trio. In contrast to the limited, sometimes idiosyncratic, range of Souness book, Sandbrooks could hardly be more impressive in its scope. He writes with authority and an eye for telling detail on every subject he covers, be it the musical influences on Paul McCartney or the tactical TTwo thirds of brides in 1968 were still virgins1 approach of the World Cupwinning manager Alf Ramsey, the crisis over the devaluation of the pound or the start of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Although the awesome depth of his knowledge is obvious, he is never ponderous. Every chapter is enlivened by sometimes in describing the establishment of pirate radio stations in the North Sea, he says that the the disc jockeys themselves cultivated a youthful, cheeky classless style that was only occasionally interrupted by bouts of seasickness. He is particularly funny on the ridiculous earnestness of the- world theatre, recounting an incident incident in 1964 when a group of actors were carrying out an experimental play at a small theatre in London, involving bottom- baring, wet fish, polythene bags and the flogging of a policeman. Suddenly the theatres caretaker burst on to the stage to complain that one of the actors had left the tap running in the dressing room. The pretentious audience took this to be part of the show. I think that the best thing in the entire evening, a most interesting performance, one said to the caretaker afterwards. Despite his subtitle, Sandbrooks central theme is that Britain did not really swing at all in the 1960s. Contrary to the myths about sexual freedom and progressive youth, Sandbrook points out that in 1968 two thirds of women were still virgins on their wedding night, Engelbert Humperdinck was more popular than the Beatles, and opinion polls showed that young people held even more reactionary attitudes towards hanging and immigration than their elders. Far from being filled with optimism, for most people the Sixties was a time of economic stagnation, as the Wilson Government limped from one crisis to another. The stench of failure hung over most government initiatives. Attempts to reform trade unions, establish state control of economic planning, maintain the value of sterling or bring democracy to Rhodesia all ended in humiliation. Wilson himself is the supreme symbol of this failure. The dynamic, popular figure of 1964 had been reduced by 1969 to a paranoid, exhausted wreck, loathed by the public and colleagues alike for his duplicity and self- delusion. It is impossible not to be struck by the parallels between Wilson and Tony Blair, another youthful, the Labour leader who came into power on a ase of democracy but achieved little beyond building a reputation for slipperiness, cronyism, gimmickry and empty rhetoric. In supporting his belief that the Seventies were uniquely rich, Sounes has assembled some fascinating material, much from his own original research. He opens with a description of a critical scene from the quintessentiaJy 1970s film, Five Easy Pieces. Directed by Bob Rafelson and starring Jack Nicholson, it heralded a quirky, naturalistic style that moved away from the slick Hollywood productions of the past. With some justification, Sounes argues that a host of groundbreaking films such as Nashville, American Graffiti, Annie Hall and A Clockwork Orange left a lasting imprint on our collective consciousness. Souness other choices of cultural highlights are quixotic, including the Pompidou Centre in Paris, designed by Richard Rogers, the writings of Hunter S. Thompson and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and the paintings of David Hockney. Sounes is full of arresting insights, such as the fact that three of the bestselling novels of the era, Frederick Forsyths The Day of the Jackal, Peter Benchleys Jaws and Mario Puzos The Godfather, were produced by authors in near penury.

"Wagner, Erica",Richard & Judy & Amanda,The Times,2006-Jun-17,"London, England","Richard & Judy & Amanda
Her nod can turn an unknown into a millionaire. But how do you get on to Amanda Ross's shortlist? Erica Wagner meets the woman who turned books into a TV phenomenon
WALK INTO THE SUNNY, Kennington office of the woman who's been called the most powerful person in British publishing, and of course the first thing you do is look at the bookshelves. They are crowded, though also decorated with mugs, treasures and family photographs that give the room a homely feel. I tilt my head to read the names: Carl Hiassen, Salley Vickers, Francis King (Francis King!)... But Amanda Ross, the joint managing director of Cactus TV and the woman who brought the Richard & Judy Book Qub into existence, is almost dismissive of the ""most powerful"" tag that has been attached to her. ""I really, really don't — and I don't pretend that I know what definitely will make a bestseller. That's not how I choose the books. My criteria, honestly, is: is this book going to entertain and engage people enough to generate 12 to 15 minutes of gripping television? The bottom line is: what's the sofa chat?"" Ross's influence is undeniable. The Richard & Judy Book Club has been going for three years on Channel 4; three years in which the ten books chosen to be discussed over ten weeks have gained increases in sales that most authors only dream of. Next week the club's Summer Reads — six more titles, revealed exclusively below — will get a huge boost when viewers pack them for the beach along with the factor 15. A heavy book buyer, Ross points out, buys about 12 books a year. But a
Richard & Judy viewer might buy 16 books ... no wonder the sales figures look as they do. I like Amanda Ross, her enthusiasm, her energy; there isn't a jaded bone in her body. I've read that she talks about books only in sales terms, rather than discussing ""literary merit""; that her views of the importance of story are simplistic. Wrong. This is a woman who loves books, who clearly wants as many people as possible to share the enjoyment. She is an evangelist with the passion of the convert. ""Books have always been a kind of exotic thing for me because I grew up in a house without any books. My family is very working-class, so we had some kind of children's encyclopaedia, a medical dictionary, and that was about it. My mum joined a book club for me and I used to get things like Black Beauty, Heidi, which I used to devour completely. ""But books weren't part of my family culture at all. At university — I was the first person in my family to go to university — I remember doing Knots, by R. D. Laing, and being completely gobsmacked that several people's parents had it at home. So I was very jealous of these people, and it's always been my ambition to have my own library, and to have my own house absolutely full of books. I don't throw books away, I can't; to me they are special, lovely things."" All this sounds breezy, a bit too easy, I think: what's the sofa chat? But isn't that the question that ap-

TSof a chat? It applies to any reader, to any book*
plies to any reader, any book? Every reader wants to engage with books; that means thinking about them, talking about them. ""What's the sofa chat?"" is as good a way as any as expressing this. She refers, more than once, to a book having ""good takeaway""; nothing to do with KFC, but whether the reader will get something lasting from the book; Nicole Krauss's The History of Love, I'd say, has stellar takeaway; so does Julian Barnes's Arthur & George. Both were Richard & Judy choices this year. Ross read drama at Birmingham; Cactus TV was set up in 1994 with her husband, Simon Ross (brother of
Jonathan). The company signed Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan in 2001 and today the show averages 2.2 million viewers. The Richard & Judy Book Club — which she conceived and insisted upon as a part of the show — runs for ten weeks, culminating in the British Book Awards, which is broadcast on Channel 4. Why just ten weeks? ""The danger in telly is that if something is successful people repeat it endlessly; but you can't do a book club all year round. You can't buy a book a week, year round."" In the first year the club's choice of Star of the Sea, by Joseph O'Connor (who until then had been graced with plenty of critical praise but no significant sales), caught everyone's attention. The week before its appearance on Richard & Judy the book sold four and a half thousand copies; sales jumped by eight thousand copies the week it was featured, and rose steadily. This year sales of Kate Mosse's
<NEWPAGE>
Labyrinth have overshadowed everything else on the list. Mosse has nothing but praise for Ross, and as a founder of the Orange Prize and presenter of Readers and Writers Roadshow, on BBC Four, as well as being the author of novels and nonfiction books, she knows what she's talking about. ""Amanda is such a high-powered executive, but she's also excellent at knowing what it feels like to be an author. I got a handwritten, detailed letter from her about Labyrinth, and a beautiful timepiece — it was such a lovely gesture."" Ross makes sure that when the author's section is filmed for the show — Mosse's, for instance, on location in Carcassone — the whole crew, everyone, reads the book first. ""The reason she has succeeded in making books work on television is that she is a passionate reader who cares about books and authors,"" Mosse says. Ross has the final say on all the book club choices, although a team of
four looks at them. By the time they get down to the last ten, it's all a question of balance. (And notjust of tone; you can't ask people to read too many fat books, she says — the list always goes ""thick thin, thick thin"".) She reveals that this year Jonathan Safran Foer's Extremely Loud and Incredibly Qose made it to the last 20; he's married to Nicole Krauss, and there was some discussion of what would happen if a husband and wife appeared on the show. In the event, though, Foer didn't make it. Julian Barnes's Man Booker shortlisted Arthur & George wasn't submitted by the publisher; Ross called it in because she'd heard how great it was. (It's reassuring to learn that publishing's miraculous elixir, word-ofmouth, can play a part in her choices.) ""Critics who don't watch the show have preconceptions about what the author's attitude is going to be,"" she says. ""I read some rubbishy stuff that people said when I chose Julian Barnes — they thought that he wouldn't like to be in the book club. But he loved it! Pat Kavanagh — his wife, who also happens to be his agent — said that for the first time he hadn't found it too painful to see himself on TV. But we do check, when books are suggested, that publishers don't submit anyone who isn't going to be committed to the whole process: they have to come to the Book Awards. Either you buy into it, or you don't."" I consider what I believe a TV executive like Ross truly understands: she understands what millions of people will like, and she knows how to present it. Why shouldn't that work with books? Why shouldn't she ask for the cover of Cecilia Ahern's novel, P.S., I Love You, to be changed from pink to blue so that Richard — and millions of male viewers — wouldn't feel uncomfortable holding it on telly or reading it on the train? She had what she describes as a ""difference of opinion"" over the cover of Richard Benson's book, TTie Farm; the paperback cover, which showed the author in an agricultural setting (sheep included) would be less appealing to urban viewers/readers than the hardback cover — a lovely illustration — had been. She lost that argument, having been told that the paperback cover was the author's choice; she subsequently found it wasn't. ""I honestly don't want to do anything that upsets the authors; they should choose the cover, they wrote the book. I only ever comment on a cover when I feel that it is doing the book a disservice, is not making it universally appealing. My job is to make things visually appealing, so if publishers don't want to listen to me on that, well..."" In a sense, of course, the Richard
& Judy Book Qub owes some of its success to Oprah Winfrey, whose book club set the trend. But the format is completely different; Oprah invites the author on to the show, so there's hardly a possibility of critical debate. ""I think the best idea we had was to keep the author out of the mix,"" Ross says. ""The author starts the piece off with a film telling the story of the book, and that lets the viewer in, too. So even if people aren't going to read the book, they can still feel involved. ""We also don't invite 'experts' to discuss the books; we get accessible celebrities. So it's not intimidating, though we do choose a celebrity who will have some relevance to the book — Bettany Hughes [the author and presenter of Helen of Troy] on Labyrinth, for instance — and usually the other guest is someone whose opinion would matter to you."" Are there any downsides to what she's created — which includes, of course, not just the book club but an initiative launched with Pan Macmillan, How To Get Published; there were 49,000 entries when that began and the winning title, 77ie Olive Readers, by Christine Aziz, has since sold 10,647 copies. Rachel Zadok's novel, Gem Squash Tokoloshe, a runner-up for the prize, was shortlisted for the Whitbread First Novel Award in 2005. Since then Macmillan has published a further six books by previously unknown authors. Certainly there's a sense of responsibility; she's beeh told, for instance, that the club has created eight author-millionaires. ""We're able to make people a lot of money out of this, and we aren't able to make any money out of it ourselves. So partly when I choose someone's book I want them to be a nice person! I know it probably sounds pathetic, but it might transform their life. Everybody sells more books than they would normally, so you'd want them to be nice people."" Nice people, I think, just like Amanda Ross. Talking to her is inspiring, a reminder that people — viewers of Richard & Judy, let's say — are as easily put into ""genres"" as books, and none of that's very useful. I get good takeaway from Ross, and feel enlivened by her warmth and vigour; I lose all awareness of her ""power"". But before I go, just as we're discussing the summer reads, I ask her if she's read any Meg Wolitzer; I so loved The Wife and The Position, and I think she would too. She's never heard of Wolitzer, and writes her name down. Then, just for a moment, I think: golly. What have I done?

Ray Greenland, has remade his life, after ten years in institutions for a crime that he committed at the age of 12. Now a marine pilot in the Thames estuary, he is another person entirely from the one who was capable of the senseless cruelty for which he was incarcerated. He has become, in fact, a good man: devoted to his wife, Lily — who knows nothing of his history — and gentle to a fault with his lively children, Flora and Eliot. Then, through a series of apparently unconnected events, Ray's past rises up to confront' him, in the shape of his half-sister, Celestine, whom he has not seen for many years. Suddenly, his life is revealed as the flimsy construct it is. But worse is the realisation that he may not have purged himself of the destructive impulses that once catastrophically overwhelmed him. As dark and gripping as anything the author has written, Ten Seconds from the Sun is a thoughtful contribution to the debate about the effectiveness or otherwise of rehabilitation for those convicted of violent crimes. It is also memorable for the robust realism of its depiction of family life — in this instance, that of the large South London clan that Ray has married into — and for the sharp lyricism of its Thames-side settings.
TEN SECONDS FROM THE SUN by Russell Celyn Jones Abacus, £7.99 B £7.59 (free p&p) Celyn Jones's psychological drama awakens echoes, as it is meant to, of certain notorious murder cases in which the perpetrators were children. His narrator,
m
Muo, revisiting his native country after ten years' exile in France. His purpose is to help his former sweetheart, the poetically named ""Volcano of the Old Moon"", who has been jailed for subversion. To free her, Muo must track down a virgin as a bribe for the terrifying judge who has sentenced Muo's beloved and many others to life imprisonment or death. Thus begins a quest that takes Sijie's unlikely hero across China, encountering a range of eccentric types on way. These include the authoritarian ""Mrs Thatcher"", overseer of an agency for domestic servants, the beguiling ""Little Road"", and a woman nicknamed ""The Embalmer"", who works in a morgue. Setting up as an interpreter of dreams, Muo is privy to their innermost secrets but comes no nearer to his goal — virgins being in short supply. Engaging as its central character is, this is not a book for the squeamish: the humour verges on the grotesque, and there is an undercurrent of darkness beneath the slapstick. Muo's Candide-like innocence does not blind him to the horrors of his country's past, and there are some sharp reminders of it throughout the story. But offsetting these grim moments are images of a gentler kind that conjure the teeming richness of Chinese life, past and present.
MR MUO'S TRAVELLING COUCH by Dai Sijie translated by Ina Rilke Vintage, £7.99 E3 £7.59 (free p&p) Following the bestselling Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress, Sijie's latest is a picaresque satire about a Chinese psychoanalyst, Mr

meets to exchange views and advice. One is a journalist, Caroline, aka ""Part-time Mum"", whose marriage is falling apart under the stress of coping with three children in various stages of independence, as well as confronting the knowledge of her husband's infidelity. The website provides sympathetic listeners, including ""Mimi"", who in real life is a hunky single father, Mark, left in charge of two bolshy preteens by his corporate trader wife. No prizes for guessing that the relationship between the ""virtual"" soul-mates soon becomes a physical ' one. Other narrative complications arise in the stories of Susan, who is bringing up a severely disabled daughter, and of Lisa, who works at Susan's local day-care centre, and longs for a baby of her own. The ingenuity with which these strands are woven together is one of the enjoyable things about the novel; another is the warmth that the author displays towards her characters. Despite its jokey title and boy-meets-girl plot, Mums@Home is not afraid to tackle more serious issues. The discrepancy between the rosy view of motherhood offered by advertising and the unglamorous reality is one; another is *. the strain that having children can place upon marriage. Full of gentle humour and insight, this is a book for anyone with a family.

He has become, in fact, a good man devoted to his wife, Lily who knows nothing of his history and gentle to a fault with his lively children, Flora and Eliot. Then, through a series of apparently unconnected events, Rays past rises up to confront him, in the shape of his half- sister, Celestine, whom he has not seen for many years. Suddenly, his life is revealed as the flimsy construct it is. But worse is the know that he may not have purged himself of the destructive impulses that once catastrophically overwhelmed him. As dark and gripping as anything the author has written, Ten Seconds from the Sun is a thoughtful contribution to the debate about the effectiveness or otherwise of rehabilitation for those convicted of violent crimes. It is also memorable for the robust realism of its depiction of family life in this instance, that of the large South London clan that Ray has married into and for the sharp lyricism of its Thames- side settings. TEN SECONDS FROM THE SUN by Russell Celyn Jones Abacus, 7. 99 B 7. 59 free Russell Celyn Joness psychological drama awakens echoes, as it is meant to, of certain notorious murder cases in which the perpetrators were children. His narrator, m Muo, revisiting his native country after ten years exile in France. His purpose is to help his former sweetheart, the poetically named Volcano of the Old Moon, who has been jailed for subversion. To free her, Muo must track down a virgin as a bribe for the terrifying judge who has sentenced Muos beloved and many others to life imprisonment or death. Thus begins a quest that takes Sijies unlikely hero across China, encountering a range of eccentric types on way. These include the authoritarian Mrs Thatcher, overseer of an agency for domestic servants, the beguiling Little Road, and a woman nicknamed The Embalmer, who works in a morgue. Setting up as an interpreter of dreams, Muo is privy to their innermost secrets but comes no nearer to his goal virgins being in short supply. Engaging as its central character is, this is not a book for the squeamish the be verges on the grotesque, and there is an undercurrent of darkness beneath the slapstick. Muos Candide- like innocence does not blind him to the horrors of his the past, and there are some sharp reminders of it throughout the story. But offsetting these grim moments are images of a gentler kind that conjure the teeming richness of Chinese life, past and present. MR MUOS TRAVELLING COUCH by Dai Sijie translated by Ina Rilke Vintage, 7. 99 E3 7. 59 free pp Following the bestselling Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress, Sijies latest is a picaresque satire about a Chinese psychoanalyst, Mr MUMSQ HOME to no toi ttdJk to tts- vape ll to full ing- m ai- te e, ama- me e, meets to exchange views and advice. One is a journalist, Caroline, aka Part- time Mum, whose marriage is falling apart under the stress of coping with three children in various stages of independence, as well as confronting the knowledge of her husbands infidelity. The website provides sympathetic listeners, including Mimi, who in real life is a hunky single father, Mark, left in charge of two bolshy preteens by his corporate trader wife. No prizes for guessing that the relationship between the virtual soul- mates soon becomes a physical one. Other narrative complications arise in the stories of Susan, who is bringing up a severely disabled daughter, and of Lisa, who works at Susans local day- care er, and longs for a baby of her own. The ingenuity with which these strands are woven together is one of the enjoyable things about the novel another is the warmth that the author displays towards her characters. Despite its jokey title and boy- meets- girl plot, MumsHome is not afraid to tackle more serious issues. The discrepancy between discrepancy between the rosy view of motherhood offered by advertising and the unglamorous reality is one another is. the strain that having children can place upon marriage.

For more than 20 years, lan Beck's illustrations of an idyllic nursery world shaped our children's imaginations. Now he has found his voice, Amanda Craig says
T'S AN ODD THING, MEETING omeone whose books have saturated your children's infancy. All the way to leafy Twickenham to meet an Beck, I keep seeing the London uburbs as if they were drawn by his graceful, quirky pen. The blossoming cherry trees, the bridge over the Thames, the Georgian elegance of Richmond could all have come straight out ofhis classic book of nursery rhymes, Lavender's Blue. For more than 20 years Beck has been as much a part of the earliest memories of modern children as Kate Greenaway and Arthur Rackham were for grandparents and great-grandparents, with books such as Five Little Ducklings, Peter and the Wolf and The Nutcracker keeping traditional songs, games and stories alive. You can have too much tradition, however, and now, at the age of 58, Beck has produced his first children's novel, The Secret History of Tom Trueheart, Boy Adventurer. It's the story of a 12-year-old boy who lives with his mother and six brave, bold and beefy brothers, all of whom are called Jack. Unlike the Jacks, Tom isn't brave, but when they disappear on quests in the Land of Stories and get their advenures sabotaged, it's up to young Tom o follow their footsteps and restore he proper endings to Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Rapunzel and so on. Postmodernism for kids has been a hit
ever since the Ahlbergs' picture book, Each Peach Pear Plum, but recently the Shrek films have made new fairytales hot stuff: not surprisingly, the Jim Henson Company is interested in the film rights. Long ago, Beck was a successful commercial illustrator, who most famously did the cover for Elton John's Good-bye Yellow Brick Road. He did magazine advertisements, record covers and even worked in the toy department of Harrods until the birth of his first child Ed, now 25, encouraged him to go into children's books. ""I thought, this is the nicest fun I've had for ages, and never went back."" His first picture book, Round and Round the Garden, was published by the children's editor David Fickling in 1982. Through Fickling, he also started a long and fruitful association with Philip Pullman, then as humble an author as Beck was an illustrator. Two more children and 63 picture books later, Beck has sold more than a million copies worldwide, with his version of traditional nursery rhymes, Lavender's Blue, being the most successful children's book published by Oxford University Press. He did not think of writing a novel of his own, however, until he shared a taxi two years ago with a fellow-illustrator, Sally Gardner. Each encouraged the other to try to write a full-length novel, and where Gardner produced the bestselling I
Coriander last year, Beck came up with an extended version of a story he originally began on the menu for a printers' club dinner. ""I liked the name, Tom Trueheart; it was a good, sturdy fairytale name and I wanted to find out what happened to him,"" he says. ""I've done a lot of traditional fairytales for other authors, and once you get inside them you think, 'Wouldn't it be interesting if.. ?'. It grew like a little seed."" What makes Beck's work so fascinating is that, like Maurice Sendak, he understands that a picture book is not just about illustrating the words. In Five Little Ducks, for instance, the pictures accompanying the familiar song tell a story about how the fifth duckling silently tries to warn his siblings and mother about a fox: like Tom Trueheart, he eventually rescues them all and reunites the family. This form of double narrative, far from confusing two-year-olds, is so stimulating that you can see why he was Philip Pullman's perfect partner for books such as Puss In Boots. ""I save up the bits I want to draw
fTom Trueheart: a good, sturdy fairytale sort of name1
in a story like a treat,"" he says. ""I somehow know what each scene should look like."" Edward Ardizzone, his hero, said that illustrations should be drawn from memory, and distilled into an essence; it is this surreal purity of vision that makes Beck's pictures so pleasing, and so archetypal. Every hill is round as a dumpling; the Moon always has a face or a cow jumping over it; the children are equally at ease riding an enormous sheep or quietly reading in a tiny walled garden. It is an idyllic nursery world whose shadows, thorns and clouds are purely decorative, and whose nostalgia never curdles into sentimentality. Yet he is also capable of much darker, more sophisticated drawing, as his work with Pullman shows. A new version of His Dark Materials has just been published by Scholastic with additional endpapers by Beck. ""It's delightful to be associated with anything like that,"" he says. ""Philip is an artist himself and takes a keen interest in how the speech bubbles and pictures work around the words. We both like variations on a known theme. Stories go so deep, they are so well-known that they seem as if they're set like cement, but
as soon as you twist them round, they become playful."" Children's books are a lifelong passion for him — he collected those illustrated by Dulac and Rackham as a student at Brighton College of Art, where he shared a flat with Pullman's other illustrator, Peter Benson, and was taught by Raymond Briggs. Part of a generation of exceptional British illustrators, he is an immensely likeable man, who is as happy to talk of the Shinto philosophy behind the anime films of Studio Ghibli as his own work. Even as we discuss our mutual admiration for the Japanese director Miyazaki, a lovely new picture book, Winston the Book Wolf, arrives from Bloomsbury. Also, he has just finished a special exhibition of his work in the psychiatric ward of the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. His sudden burst of productivity is caused by the recent death of two close friends. ""It took me a long time — 20 years of learning in public — to work out what I was best at doing and I'd always written things in a frustrated kind of way; but after my friends died suddenly I realised I'd better get a move on."" Tom Trueheart, which looks likely to become one of the hits of 2006, now has a sequel, In the Land of Dark Stories, which promises to be even more exciting because the rescued princesses can stop being passive and join Tom in the battle against the evil Ormerod and his sidekick Rumplestiltskin. It is all rollocking, rumbustious stuff, with plenty of jokes and a lot of input from Beck's grown-up children. Ed, a film-maker, has directed a trailer for the website (www.tomtrueheart.com), largely shot in the garden of his old friend Nicola Bayley, where Beck's 15-year-old daughter Lily is spotted as a princess. There's no doubt our hero, a nice young lad with a toy wooden sword, will graduate to the big, beefy type (Beck's other son, Lawrence) shown holding a real metal broadsword and preparing to tackle something nasty in the dark woods. It is just right for children of 6-10, but at the same time you can't help hoping that the earlier, innocent world of wooden swords won't fade away completely. www. tomtrueheart. com",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0502832443/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=8b43320c,"Mr a d iver et re For more than 20 years, The Becks illustrations of an idyllic nursery world shaped our children imaginations.

BROKEN VERSES by Kamila Shamsie Bloomsbury, £7.99 E £6.39 (free p&p) When Aasmaani Inqalab, a researcher for a Karachi television station, learns that the veteran actress Shehnaz Saeed will be joining the cast of the station's long-running soap opera, she is apprehensive. For Shehnaz was a close friend of Aasmaani's mother, Samina — a political activist who disappeared 14 years before, after the murder of her lover, Nazim Hikmet, a poet critical of Pakistan's military regime. Aasmaani, who adored them both, has never got over her feelings of betrayal at her mother's desertion of her for Nazim - ""the Poet"", as he is referred to. Then she starts receiving letters written in a code used by Nazim to correspond with her mother, and the possibility that the Poet may still be alive arises. As she grapples with the mystery, Aasmaani confronts the demons not only of her own past but of her country's recent history. In this she is assisted by Ed Khan, Shehnaz's son. Ed is handsome, witty and clever — an ideal match for the wisecracking Aasmaani. But he too has issues in his past to be resolved. Shamsie deals with the changing role of women in the Muslim world with a lightness of touch that never detracts from the seriousness of her message. Broken Verses is not without its flaws — its central character has her irritating moments, and the conversations between her and the flirtatious Ed read like bad Richard Curtis — but overall this is a good-hearted work, with some sharp things to say about female oppression.
l«L STWES STORIES WE COULD TELL by Tony Parsons HarperCollins, £6.99 E £6.64 (free p&p) Since the publication of the bestselling Man and Boy, Parsons has established himself as a hipper version of Nick Hornby — focusing on relationships and the trials of fatherhood. But he began his career as a music journalist on NME, chronicling the emerging punk rock phenomenon. It is to this era that Stories We Could Tell returns, following its hero, Terry, and two of his fellow scribes on the cult music magazine The Paper through one turbulent summer's night in 1977. Terry, newly returned from covering a Berlin concert by the legendary ""Godfather of Punk"", Dag Wood, is excited at the thought of introducing the latter to Misty, his photographer girlfriend, when all three attend a gig at a cutting-edge club, The Western World. Also at the club are gentle, hippyish Ray, who has been told his days at The Paper are numbered if he fails to come up with an interview with John Lennon. Then there is Leon, a political activist who believes that music can change the world. His world is changed that night — by love. Shocks and reversals are in store for all the characters. Against a backdrop of National Front riots and dole queues the author conveys a pitch-perfect account of what being young in the late 1970s was all about. His depiction of his characters is sharply precise — as is his recollection of the era's music. The result is as funny and touching as anything he has written.
THE GIRL FROM THE CHARTREUSE by Pierre Peju translated by Ina Rilke Vintage, £7.99 H £7.59 (free p&p) Three damaged lives intersect in a dream-like fable that considers the relationship between life and books. Etienne Vollard, a bookseller, has spent his life immersed in other's versions of reality: as a passionate bibliophile, he has committed thousands of stories to memory. He prefers words to people — until the day a child runs out in front of his van and is nearly killed. Eva, the ""petite Chartreuse"", exists only as a silent presence. Comatose for much of the novel, she draws together Etienne and Therese, her wayward mother. Therese's neglect of her daughter is the indirect cause of the accident. Unable to face the consequences of this, she surrenders responsibility for Eva's rehabilitation to Etienne. When he visits the little girl in hospital, Etienne offers the only solace he knows — which is derived from books. In scenes reminiscent of Almodovar's Talk to Her he attempts to get through to the unconscious Eva by telling her stories. But in the end, even fiction fails him. Admirers of Paul Auster's elliptical tales will recognise elements of his method — derived from the 1960s nouveau roman. There is the same postmodern intertextuality; the same philosophical tendency; the same fondness for cryptic sentences. If the result verges on the pretentious, that is no more than might be expected from a professor of philosophy with a taste — to judge from the numerous quotations — for literature at its most abstruse.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0503462263/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=d6cce2de,"Fiction Christina Koning GI To buy books at discounted prices, call 0870 1608080 or visit shop. co. uk booksfirst BROKEN VERSES by Kamila Shamsie Bloomsbury, 7. 99 E 6. 39 free pp When Aasmaani Inqalab, a researcher for a Karachi television station, learns that the veteran actress Shehnaz Saeed will be joining the cast of the stations long- running soap opera, she is apprehensive.

Memoirs are made of this
Lost sisters, damaged fathers, mad husbands - everybody with a family has a tale to tell. But Bel Mooney wonders if their stories are really fact or fiction
THE TITLE OF MARY LOUDON'S last book offers insight into the complexity of memoir. Secrets and Lives was an oral history of the people of Wantage in the Studs Terkel tradition. Yet the fact that the brain automatically supplies ""lies"" instead of ""lives"" is a reminder of the central problem of life-writing. As the most ordinary lives contain secrets, truth is always a relative stranger — belonging to no one yet claimed by the imagination, with its whisper of ""what if? Six volumes of memoir sit on my desk, of which two are outstanding, and all compulsively readable. Some sort of family dysfunction is the sine qua non for each. Loudon's own Relative Stranger sets out to give ""a life after death"" to her older, schizophrenic sister who took on a male identity; John Burnside's A Lie About My Father evokes ""the dark, bruised presence"" of the damaged father who damaged his son. Mother Country by Jeremy Harding is the poignantly understated tale of two mothers, natural and adoptive — ""real and imagined""; while Horatio Clare writes the biography of a divorce in pellucid prose. Keeping Mum (Brian Thompson) and A Secret Madness (Elaine Bass ) dissect two bizarre marriages in the sepia hues of 1940s and 1950s austerity. Such summings-up are inevitably simplistic; each memoir is a complex universe in itself, and all employ some ofthe narrative methods ofthe novel. Ten years ago, such life stories would probably have been seen through the prism of fiction: the personal universalised by art — even at the level of the roman a clef. Today ""real"" life is easier to market: memoir is the form for our time. Mary Loudon's opening sentence launches briskly into shock: ""On the 27th January 2001, while I was skiing fast down a mountain in France, my sister Catherine was dying slowly in England; in a hospital I didn't know she had been admitted to, from a cancer I didn't know she had, under an identity I had no idea existed."" Her quest was to find answers: ""I could not let her go without an effort. I did not want to claim her, only to
locate her... I wanted to find... the family member we had lost and preserve some of her essence for good."" This she achieves triumphantly with a novelist's eye for detail — even nudging the heartbreaking chaos of her sister's terrible flat towards the transforming beauty of still life. Catherine Loudon lived her final years as a man, and Mary's efforts to understand why leads her into encounters with some extraordinary characters, among them Mr Carpenter, the mortuary technician who displays respect and grace; Karen the Care Worker who tells how ""Stevie"" played the piano; George from the corner shop whose care in the simple ways of sandwiches and tobacco prompts an epiphany about human kindness worthy ofthe author of Middlemarch: ""In every village, every town, every city and every country there are people like George doing kind, decent, selfless things simply because to do those things is right."" Vivid, true and moving. This is memoir as painstaking investigation: Loudon's conversations are recorded, and she does not speculate, but alternates her quest with telling anecdote and (most sad) the 1973 diary of their father, who travelled fruitlessly to India to bring his mentally ill daughter home. Gradually, as Cathy's character is rounded out and her damaged life given dignity and meaning, Loudon is changed too, as if the journey towards her lost sister adds new dimensions of complexity and humility to her own life. Behind this is another voice — that of the cool writer for whom everything is grist and method is all: ""Objectifying an experience is part of the distillation necessary to turn it into something readable..."" Sentences themselves impose order: the act of writing is as healing as the quest itself. The poet and novelist John Burnside quotes a line from Marguerite Duras which translates as: ""It is the unknown you carry within — to write, it's that or nothing."" He takes the idea of memoir as self-discovery a stage further than

Loudon, not flinching from his own drug abuse, psychosis and estrangement from the bullying, inadequate father who ruined his ufe—and arguably created the writer. Burnside lays down a challenge in the Lie of his title and his first statement: ""This book is best treated as a work of fiction."" He consciously conjures up stories (""I can imagine him so easily in the telling. .."") about the father who lied so much about his own background that Burnside did not know until after his death that he had been left on a doorstep in West Fife. This account of a failed father-son relationship is written with extraordinary beauty and insight, repeatedly opening Chinese boxes of meaning: ""A photograph, a family story, the recollections of some old-timer at a wedding or funeral, are works of art, not facts"", and ""However hard you try to avoid it, fatherhood is... something that is not only told to, but told by, others."" His sophisticated sensibility occasionally sounds a false note, as when Father takes them to a cut-price warehouse for bargains. ""When... we picked out what we wanted, I was struck by the sadness of our possessions... worthless, ill-made objects..."" The child clutching the cheap tennis racket is only 10, so
when Burnside recalls being ""sad and ashamed"" this is surely ""all after the fact, all construction"". He knows that the distinction between transformation and invention is fine, so after describing the solitary life of the father he did not see, he hauls us back to reality: ""I'm sure my father felt these things—but these are my words, and this is the real lie about my father. I cannot talk about him without talking about myself, just as I can never look at myself in the mirror without seeing his face."" His is a profound meditation on the life of the spirit, and all the shadows we carry in our hearts. Life-writing is a yardstick by which you can measure your own story, offering insight and consolation in equal measure. When James Frey's bestselling memoir, A Million Little Pieces, was revealed to be largely fiction, it sparked this riposte from his publisher, Nan Talese. ""Memoir is personal recollection. It is not absolute fact. It's how one remembers what happened."" But what if it happened before you were born? Horatio Clare tackles this head-on in his account of his parents' doomed 1960s dream of family life on a bleak Welsh hill farm. He has reconstructed from his parents' stories and diaries ""and supplied the rest from my imagina-
tion"". Why? ""I needed to try to see the world as it was then, through the eyes of a young couple who tried to make it turn for them. I hoped, by telling the story, to understand it better."" Loudon and Burnside are breathing life into the dead but Clare's subjects are living, and he is aware ofthe pitfalls: ""I fear in its intrusion and exposure this book may distress its subjects, the people I love most."" The requirement that memoir must read like fiction can lead to absurdity. Clare apparently recalls verbatim an exchange with his father when he was 6, and Elaine Bass tells the bleak story of her postwar marriage to a man with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder in reams of direct speech, that are in the end exasperating and make the suspension of disbelief impossible. The press release says that this ""reads like a novel"", and I found myself wishing that Mrs Bass, who is 84, had done a Mary Wesley and told her story as fiction, instead of allowing it to fall between two stools. But had she done so she would have been lucky to find a publisher. Similarly Brian Thompson's wonderful wartime childhood is apparently told with the help of Mary Loudon's taperecorder, the conversations between the 9-year-old and his dysfunctional Yank-loving mum as vivid as screenplay. The line between fact and fiction is thoroughly blurred. As Jeremy Harding says, ""wild conjecture is always ready to fill the gaps"". Does it matter? We live in a culture where phrases such as ""virtual reality"" and ""creative nonfiction"" have meaning, and where the television schedules are dominated by flyon-the-wall and confessional. Dave Peltzer has perfected the genre of memoir as self-harm, and for every Angela's Ashes there is a refutation by an aggrieved sibling. The internet is awash with bloggers' lives and recently Blake Morrison (master ofthe ""intrusive"" memoir) said on Radio 4 that more lives of ordinary people should be recorded. With luck one or two will contain literary gems like this from Harding: ""There was a trace of dusk about the early afternoon on Ladbroke Grove. As the cloud let up, a brief burst of sunlight raked a No 52 bus. The inside of the lower deck glowed like a church, as though each passenger had lit a spill and held it up at the window.""

SEVEN FOR A SECRET (5+) by Laurence Anholt and Jim Coplestone GRANDPARENTS ARE among my most assiduous and responsive correspondents, so I'm always looking out for good books featuring this special relationship between old and young.

Laurence Anholt's Seven Secret, Ruby, aged 6, has what her grandfather looks like. She begins a correspondence with her ""grampa"" one night when it's noisy in the city, and she can't sleep. He lives in the countryside, *jf. with only a dog and the magpies outside for company, and longs for his son, Ruby's father, to come to s live with him. He tells Ruby the old rhyme about magpies — ""One for sorrow, two for joy..."" As their tender, innocent letters cross, a relationship develops. Each tells the other a secret. Ruby's is that her mother is going to have another baby. Grampa's is that he has ""been hiding shiny things for a long time, just like the magpies"". He makes a magpie necklace for his granddaughter, and the birds come to symbolise the freedom that Ruby's family yearns for. Anholt's bestselling Chimp and Zee books, and his dramatisations of the lives of Picasso, Degas and Monet, were outstanding in showing a child'seye view of family life and art, but this has a new depth. Ruby's parents are about to be evicted because they can't pay the rent. Grampa's illness becomes acute, and Ruby knows when he dies because she is visited by a single magpie — one for sorrow. The two

of magpies look on is deeply affecting, as the next page shows Ruby's family welcoming the baby under the rising sun. This is a book about bereavement as well as a fairytale with a happy ending. It is striking how often loss and mourning are best tackled in picture books rather than novels — Harry Horse's classic, The Last Polar Bears, also features an intrepid grandfather, journeying to the North Pole, sending back letters to his grandchild in an extended metaphor for death.

When grandparents play an important part in of lives, their loss is especially hard the precious hours that they spend with their descendants cant be celebrated enough.

THE BOOKS THAT WE BORROW SAY more about our literary tastes than the books that we own. If your bookshelves are anything like mine, they contain several hundred acres of the printed word that will never be read, at least not by me. There are Christmas gifts that we never wanted but cannot throw away, books we feel that we ought to read but cannot face and the obligatory copy of Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time, that will never be opened because life is several aeons too short. But library books are different. People borrow the library books that they actually want, and then actually read them. Unlike the bestseller lists, they are not an index of fashion, of reviews and book clubs, or of the effects of marketing and advertising. Library books are the works of literature that we want to read but not necessarily to own and keep. The Public Lending Rights figures for the most-borrowed books, published this week, offer a strange and revealing snapshot of modern Britain. To judge from the statistics, our love affair with romantic fiction has ended; instead, we have taken up with television chefs, crochet-hooks, French people and cricketers. For 17 years Dame Catherine Cookson, queen of the pot-boiler romance, has reigned
* m
supreme in Britain's public libraries. In 1994, she occupied numbers one to nine in the top ten most borrowed books list, with Barbara Taylor Bradford sneaking into the No 10 spot. Today, Dame Catherine does not figure in the top ten. For the third year running, the most borrowed writer in Britain is the children's author Jacqueline Wilson. J. K. Rowling, by comparison, limps in at No 74. Of the 20 most-borrowed children's titles, 16 are by the staggeringly prolific Ms Wilson. Casting an eye down the most-borrowed titles list, it becomes clear that there is a special category of book that people like to borrow in huge numbers, but do not wish to possess, just in case the neighbours come round. Trinny and Susannah, Kim and Aggie, Paul McKenna and Gillian McKeith all do well in this category. To borrow and read these books is one thing, but to have them in your bookshelves practically screams: I am a badly-dressed, unhygienic, slightly bonkers person worried about my bodily functions. The evergreen Official Theory Test for Car Drivers by the Driving Standards Agency comes in at No 19, one below Dave Pelzer's The Lost Boy. This seems only right, since both are written in the same style: repetitive, glutinous and heart-wrenchingly sad. Cookery provides another window of revelation. In the country as a whole, we prefer Jamie Oliver's recipes, but this disguises wide regional culinary-literary variations. Londoners are gorging on Nigella Lawson, but the Welsh prefer Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. Welsh library habits deserve a study of their own. In dogs, for example, the Welsh look far afield, displaying a particular preference for Yorkshire terriers, despite the national affinity for labradors. Welsh travel reading, however, seems less adventurous. While other parts of the country read about France and Spain, and Londoners dream of Scotland, the favourite Welsh travel book is The Rough Guide to Wales. Books about moving abroad are being borrowed in record numbers, but luckily we don't all want to go to the same place. The occupants of the Orkney Islands read about moving to Tuscany; in Devon they imagine buying somewhere in France; in Northumberland they think about heading for the Australian
Outback. Most library users imagine moving to somewhere warmer, drier and more interesting, but not in Fife, where they still dream of relocating to Canada. Mind you, each region has foibles. By far the most popular pet books nationwide are about tortoises; except in Scotland where, apparently, people much prefer to read about snakes. As for hobbies, while Londoners love to crochet, in the North of England borrowers can't get enough of ""Tea Bag Folded Greetings Cards"", a pastime I have never even heard of before. The library lists also offer a rough guide to national hypochondria. Overall, the most-borrowed health book is Defying Age: How to Think, Act and Stay Young. It may come as no surprise to discover that the most popular medical book in the libraries of Northern Ireland is Stress and Nervous Disorders; in Wales readers mug up on The Vitamins and Minerals Handbook, while Scottish readers like to relax with a well-thumbed library copy of How to Lower High Blood Pressure, preferably while smoking a fag and eating a deep-fried Mars bar. The top film, television and music biography last year was Being Jordan by Katie Price, whereas the top historical biography was Claire Tomalin's superb Samuel Pepys: The Unequalled Self. This may be a profoundly depressing statement about the contrast between great lives of the past and great lives ofthe present; on the other hand, I have a suspicion that Pepys and Jordan would have got on rather well. What we read also reflects what, and how, we like to kill. Our own Jane Shilling's The Fox in the Cupboard is the most popular British book in the hunting, shooting and fishing category, but in Scotland they prefer The Pigeon Shooter by John Batley, and in Wales David Brian Plummer's Ferrets. When the aliens finally land in Britain, they will no doubt head to the local library to mug up on exactly what sort of planet they have come to. There the real Britain will be revealed: a nation of age-defying, fox-hunting, tea-bag card-making, food-loving crochet fanatics most of whom, frankly, would rather be in Tuscany; or, if Welsh, in Wales. www.plr.uk.com",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0502963908/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=012d9c15,"By Ben Macintyre TWe are a nation of age- defying, tea- bag- card- making crochet fans THE BOOKS THAT WE BORROW SAY more about our literary tastes than the books that we own.

bears a striking resemblance to Sleepless in Seattle, a similarity reinforced by a tendency towards sentimentality. Having said this, it is enjoyable reading, with some strongly realised characters. The best of these is the curmudgeonly Leo Gursky, a retired locksmith in his eighties, who lives in a run-down apartment in New York. Leo, we learn, escaped from Poland after the German invasion in 1939, arriving in America in search of his former sweetheart, who had been pregnant with his child — only to find she had married someone else. Years later, Leo learns of the death of the son that he never knew, who has grown up to be a famous writer. Also in search of love — albeit vicariously — is the 14-year-old Alma Singer, whose widowed mother Charlotte is translating an obscure Chilean novel, The History of Love, at the request of Jacob Marcus, a man she has never met. Deciding that he will be an appropriate suitor for her mother, Alma doctors Charlotte's side of the correspondence to make it seem as if she wants to pursue a relationship. The outcome is not at all what Alma expects, but it does unlock the mystery of the authorship of the eponymous novel, leaving the reader with a satisfying sense of loose ends having been tied up and justice having been done. .......

Presiding over the establishment is the hard-faced Mama-san, mother of Mary's yakuza gangster boyfriend, Yuji, who works for the local crime boss. Other memorable characters include Watanabe, in reality the kitchen-boy at the Sayonara but in his fantasies a superhero with the power to save the world — and in particular the beautiful Mary —from disaster. Persuaded by his overbearing boss to visit the bar is the shy and lonely Mr Sato, whose late wife is still very much present in his life. The stories are interwoven with considerable ingenuity. Each of the three main voices — Mary's, Watanabe's, Mr Sato's — is entirely distinctive,and each conveys details that the others overlook. On it own, this tale of misfits trapped in a nightclub limbo would be enjoyable enough, but Barker has given it the pace and excitement of a thriller — or of the manga comics to which Watanabe is addicted. Funny, crisply written and engaging, Sayonora Bar offers sharp insights into some of the less palatable realities of life in 21st century Japan.

The narrator is John Milk, an undergraduate when we first meet him, and later one of Kinsey's ""inner circle"" of researchers, whose interviews on sexual preferences with Americans from all walks of life were the foundation of Kinsey's theories. ""Prok"", as he is known to intimates, was a charismatic figure, whose influence over those closest to him was, by this account at least, unhealthily intense. Thus Milk, is sexually initiated both by Prok and his wife, the no less rapacious ""Mac""; later, they give their blessing to Milk's marriage to Iris, another student, on the assumption that the newlyweds will continue to participate in Prok's research. This means that Milk will continue to have sexual relations with others — including Prok — a situation that Iris finds increasingly hard to accept. As the marriage founders, Milk must choose between his mentor and his wife. Hilarious and disturbing by turns, The Inner Circle charts the tensions that arise when conventional notions of love and marriage are overturned and when private affairs becomes material for public consumption. Kinsey emerges as more monster than liberator, but the importance of his contribution to redefining the way that we think about sex is never seriously in question.

Jarhead is the nickname adopted by the US Marines to describe the haircuts that make their heads look like empty pots of jam. It's also the title of Anthony Swofford's bestselling book about his tour of duty in the 1991 Gulf War. Swofford and his platoon are dispatched to Saudi Arabia to protect American interests and ""kick some Iraqi ass"". They spend five months going stir-crazy in the desert. They butt heads, drill until they drop, and fail to shoot a single bullet in anger. When the war eventually kicks off, it is won by the Air Force in a matter of days. The only person Swoff comes close to killing is himself. Sam Mendes turns this epic waste of time into the most beautiful and pointless war movie ever made. If that's his deliberate intention, he succeeds with rare style. Jarhead is littered with haunting images: the elegant corpse of a toasted refugee; a highway crammed with blasted scrap; flaming wells that turn day into night; and showers of black rain. These are visions worthy of Dante's Inferno. The art is stunning, yet the film has the topical firepower of a potato gun. It's not entirely Mendes's
Sr
fault. The current crisis in Iraq makes the first Gulf War seem shockingly dated. But the motives are spookily familiar. The faulty politics hog entire pages of Swofford's original memoir. They are puny gripes in Mendes's film. It's almost as if the British director has had his wings clipped by nervous Hollywood executives. He fails to grab the book by the horns. He skates around the oily issues, and he fudges the irony of trailer-trash soldiers who sacrifice their lives defending the fortunes of total strangers. What's left of Jarhead is the simple agonising hell ofbeing a 19-year-old soldier who has the stuffing knocked out of him by professional bastards. Jake Gyllenhaal is terrific as the jaundiced Swoff, who looks back on his career in the Marines with nostalgia, wonder and bitterness. If you thought he looked butch with his shirt off in Brokeback Mountain brace yourself for a beefy surprise. ""Welcome to the Suck,"" sneers Peter Sarsgaard when Swoff is tied to his bunk ready for branding with a red-hot coat hanger. Swoff and his crew are brutalised and brainwashed. They smell like skunks, and masturbate ad nauseam. When they
are excited they beat their chests and bellow like oversexed apes. The homoerotic sadism is filmed in stifling close-up. Roger Deakins's camerawork is as tight and intimate as the cast. A thumping soundtrack of rap and T-Rex adds a comic beat to the sensory bombardment. The film takes off when they land in the Gulf. Waiting week after week for the order

to advance shreds the nerves. It's a harrowing portrait of highly trained killers halfcrazed by uncertainty, sand and lies. Mendes captures the cock-eyed absurdity of these caged animals. But it's hardly fresh turf. One itches for the bigger picture and sharper teeth. Mendes is in need of both if he hopes to land a significant and serious blow. The themes of Neil Jordan's latest melodrama bear close
(to the point of Groundhog Day) similarity to his 1992 hit The Crying Game. In Breakfast on Pluto the pain of the Irish Troubles is once more allegorically aligned to the strife of a transvestite star. Cillian Murphy is the one-note wonder in this picaresque tale of a boy in search of a happy family. He looks convincingly feminine in drag, but there is little snap, crackle, or pop about the quest to find his natural mother — a Mitzi Gaynor lookalike who abandons him at birth on Father Liam Neeson's parish steps before disappearing to London. Kitten (as Murphy playfully styles himself) is the Quentin Crisp of a small border town in Ireland. He drifts from a bleak childhood in the 1960s to the seedy side of London in the 1970s without a single serious thought in his dreamy head. The irony is that he is forever falling into the wrong hands at the wrong time, be it IRA killers or the Metropolitan Police. The endless chapter headings - ""1. In Which I Am Abandoned"" — pave the way. Like Crisp, Kitten is a life-long martyr to sexual identity and innocence, and he's forever being beaten up for both. The pain is dressed in ill-fitting

comedy. Murphy wears it a shade too lightly for us to truly care. His episodic scrapes generate plenty of action but precious little logic. Things happen to Kitten in much the same way as bikes crash into lampposts. He is adopted by a gay glam rock star. He is ensconced in a caravan with a stash of IRA weapons. He slips almost seamlessly into prostitution in London, and is improbably salvaged by a kindly magician (Stephen Rea). Kitten is forever reli.ant on the kindness of strangers. ""Get a job here. It's safe, and it's legal,"" says a policeman, dropping him outside a West End peep show. This shortly after the same concerned bobby has beaten him unconscious for being a suspected bomber. Rob Marshall's adaptation of Arthur Golden's novel, Memoirs of a Geisha, is a sentimental Japanese fairytale about a little girl who grows up to become a legendary geisha. She is Sold into slavery by her struggling parents, and blossoms into Sayuri (Zhang Ziyi). The price of her virginity breaks all pre-Second World War records, but she holds a candle for the elegant chairman of an electricity company (Ken Watanabe),
who once bought her an ice-cream. It's undiluted slush that makes a preposterous virtue of mangled English accents, industrial sacks of pancake make-up, and any wild twist of fate you care to mention. Sayuri's in-house rival is Gong Li, a Cruella De Vil vamp with a satisfyingly vicious habit of inflicting maximum pain for no apparent reason at all. The arrival of the war scatters the cast around Japan for several reels while we wipe our teary cheeks. The years roll by. The geishas gather again, looking spookily untouched by age and wisdom, and waste no time trying to plant daggers in each other's backs. Some venerable traditions never change. Cry Wolf is a teen scream movie by Jeff Wadlow with a worryingly low 12A certificate. A group of oak-thick high-school students decide to spend Hallowe'en faying to murder each other after a game of truth or dare. They are inspired by a serial killer called the Wolf, a regulation campus psycho who floats unnoticed around the school wearing a khaki jacket, an orange ski mask, and a 24in serrated elephant knife. All the usual nonsense applies.

g parenthood offered in her first novel, The Clematis Tree, seems, if anything, to have worsened in her latest book. The topic here is the plight of single fathers — although the author also goes into the iniquitous behaviour of single mothers at some length. Representing the former is Jason Kirk, a teacher in a failing secondary school. Returning home after a hard day instructing his charges in the rudiments of English history, Jason finds that his wife, Kat, has left him, taking their two children with her. The reason that she gives for taking such a step is that her marriage is no longer what it was. Despite Jason's attempts to persuade her to change her mind, she remains adamant that she prefers life without him. To make matters worse — and matters always are made worse in Widdecombe's novels — Kat does her utmost to prevent Jason from seeing his children, to whom he is devoted. She also brings him close to financial ruin, by taking their case to the Child Support Agency. If the writing were more subtle and the characters more than mouthpieces for the author's opinions, the political message might be more effective. But as it stands, it is hard to sympathise with the predicament either of the longsuffering Jason, on of his inexplicably heartless spouse.

She is, by her own admission, driven — so afraid of missing a vital call that even when she is enjoying a ""destressing"" massage her mobile phone is switched on. This high-pressure existence comes to an abrupt end when Samantha finds herself out of a job, having brought about an important client's bankruptcy through a careless mistake. Unable to face the consequences, she flees to the countryside and a job as housekeeper to the nouveau riche Trish and Eddie. Since her culinary skills extend only to making toast, and she has no idea how to switch on a washing-machine, this new career seems doomed. But the intervention of the handsome gardener, Nathaniel, saves the day and Samantha becomes a convert to the joys of domesticity. Then — by one of those plot twists that the author manages so well — she is faced with a choice between her old world and her new.

The setting is Hastings, whose mixture of out-of-season seediness and charm is sharply captured as a backdrop to their contrasting fortunes. Some of the best comic moments come when the two entirely incompatible families collide — as in a cringe-making dinner party scene that ends with more than just abuse being hurled. The party at which the girls engage in their first timid sexual encounters is horribly funny. Offsetting the laughs are darker episodes, describing Rachel's decline into depression and drug-taking, after a love affair that goes wrong. But despite forays into a harsher realism, the overall mood is lighthearted. Fans of the author's confrontational style as a comedian will not be surprised that she uses the same tactics in her writing. There are lots of off-colour jokes, references to bodily functions and swearing but the effect is good-humoured. There is affection in Brand's portrayal of her characters, whose amorous adventures seem destined to end, not in heartbreak but happiness. Underneath the four-letter words and sexual .fumbling, a romantic tale of true love winning over adversity is struggling to emerge.

The new way forward is back
Palm Pilot Man claimed that the electronic world would kill off books. Not so, Philip Oltermann says. It has simply made us more aware of their beauty
Big is beautiful: TheAtlas Maior of mm
A FEW DAYS AFTER THE London Review Bookshop opened in Bloomsbury two-and-a-half years ago, a salesperson manoeuvred past the lavish display of new hardbacks, stepped up to the counter ofthe manager, Andrew Stilwell, and placed a smooth metal object in front of him. This, he said proudly, was the future of books. Others in the queue held their breath. A Palm Pilot. Thank you, but no it wasn't, Stilwell said. They sold Gameboys down the road. The Palm Pilot Men talk with much confidence about publishing these days. The era of the printed page, they claim, is ending. The future is digital, paperless and Bluetooth-compatible. Bill Gates insists that Microsoft's portable Tablet PC — launched in 2002 — could render traditional publishing obsolete in four to five years. But take any of the apostles of the e-book to a bookshop this Christmas and they might lose some of their swagger. They may pick up the new McSweeney's Quarterly, for example. The American author Dave Eggers's playful, experimental journal for fiction, now on its sixteenth issue, has perfected the old-fashioned, dusty tome look: these are books that look like books. The latest is a cheeky foldout number, complete with a pack of playing cards and comb. They may also chance upon
Taschen's table-sized Atlas Maior of 1665, a reprint of Joan Blaeu's baroque masterpiece of mapmaking. The original's 596 maps came in 11 volumes, and kept Blaeu's copperplate presses busy for 1,600 days. Perhaps it is just coincidence that Taschen decided to republish it in the year that Google launched its virtual globe project, Google Earth. At £100 a copy, it doesn't come cheap, but then the price has symbolic value: quality doesn't sell for £99.99. The result of an even more painstaking labour of love is Audrey Niffenegger's The Three Incestuous Sisters. Her bestselling novel The Time Traveler's Wife took five years to travel from the conception of its title to the bookshelves in Sainsbury's — no time at all, compared with her visual tale of jealous siblings, ghostly ancestors and flying babies. Using aquatint, she spent 14 years making ten copies. Before Cape decided to publish a cheaper mass market version, they sold for around £1,000 each. Collector's edition chic is also in vogue: Zadie Smith's On Beauty, for example, comes complete with beautifully patterned endpapers — a design quirk that one used to find almost exclusively in special editions. Even the booklets in Penguin's ""Great Ideas"" series, with their proud typography and ornamental frames, look like the sort of thing that one would pick
up at a fine press fair not a book chain. Waterstone's picked up on the success of internet book auction sites earlier this year and started commissioning special editions from publishers. Commercially successful new titles — from Kazuo Ishiguro to Lauren Bacall — now come with a slightly more expensive collectable twin. Far from pushing traditional bookmaking to the edge, internet publishing seems to have breathed new life into it and reminded it of its strengths. Any of the above titles could make your iBook melt with envy, so self-assured are they in their celebration of the nostalgic, emotive qualities ofthe book as a material object. Simon Prosser, the Penguin editor who decided to publish McSweeney's in Britain, says: ""You can pick them up, put them down, take them to bed, admire the way they've been conserved within their covers, show them off to your friends or smell the distinctive scent of print on paper. Books are sometimes more than the words they contain."" Niffenegger, who has a professorship at the Columbia College Chicago Centre for Book and Paper Arts, agrees that the electronic book is still a long, while away. ""The internet hasn't yet adapted to the human body,"" she says. ""The book is different: even its different parts are named after parts of the human body. You
have the head and the foot of the book, the spine, and the size is adapted to the size of your hands."" This hands-on approach to bookmaking would have struck a chord with William Morris, the late-nineteenth century socialist, textile designer and patron saint of the good page. After the Industrial Revolution, Morris was much concerned with cleaning up British book design; a ""sordid, aimless, ugly confusion"" not a far cry from what reigns on the web today. Is there a return to the spirit of the Arts and Crafts movement? Real typesetters say no: ""What we are dealing with is a return to the oldfashioned style of bookmaking, but not a return to the original principles,"" according to Michael Mitchell, director of Libanus Press and the author of Book Typography: A Designer's Manual. No big publishing house in Britain still prints and typesets its own books, he points out, and with cheap printers available all over the world, the distance between the editorial boardroom and the inkies' workshop is ever increasing. Claire M. Bolton, of Alembic Press in Abingdon, chuckles: ""I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of editors don't even know what a typeface looks like."" But for the big publishers, ""fine"" printing can make commercial sense if executed strategically. The production costs of a reprint are well below that of
the original art book, so experiments such as the Niffenegger book are unlikely to send Cape's sales teams into a panic. The Three Incestuous Sisters h&' boosted her respectability. Profit margins on Waterstone's limited editions are healthy too: with print runs of 1,000, they are ""limited"" only in the faintest sense — rare enough to justify a price rise but available in every branch. Even the lavish Atlas Maior is less of a risk than it seems — Taschen saves money by selling one multilingual edition in different countries. At the London Review Bookshop, Stilwell decided to do things the oldfashioned way when he started publishing a series of special editions this year. He purchased the pages of Julian Barnes's Arthur & George frorn^) Random House and had 125 copies cloth-bound at £50, and 25 with a leather cover at £125. The venture was a success, and the books sold out in ten days. Then the standard hardback edition arrived, they too were clothbound with an old-world engraving. Random House had pastiched the look of a special edition and was selling it for no more than £17.99. ""We wanted to court the bookshop browser, not just the Amazon surfer,"" according to the publisher's sales manager, Tom Drake-Lee. Perhaps the future of books is if£ the past —just try to explain that to Palm Pilot Man.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0502956954/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=c10d79b0,"T? ndpapers The new way forward is back Palm Pilot Man claimed that the electronic world would kill off books. Not so, Philip Oltermann says. It has simply made us more aware of their beauty Big is beautiful TheAtlas Maior of books A FEW DAYS AFTER THE London Review Bookshop opened in Bloomsbury two- and- a- half years ago, a salesperson ed past the lavish display of new hardbacks, stepped up to the counter shop manager, Andrew Stilwell, and placed a smooth metal object in front of him. This, he said proudly, was the future of books. Others in the queue held their breath. A Palm Pilot. Thank you, but no it ful, Stilwell said. They sold Gameboys down the road. The Palm Pilot Men talk with much confidence about publishing these days. The era of the printed page, they claim, is ending. The future is digital, paperless and Bluetooth- compatible. Bill Gates insists that Microsofts portable Tablet PC launched in 2002 could render traditional publishing obsolete in four to five years. But take any of the apostles of the e- book to a bookshop this Christmas and they might lose some of their swagger. They may pick up the new McSweeneys Quarterly, for example. example. The American author Dave Eggerss playful, experimental journal for fiction, now on its sixteenth issue, has perfected the old- fashioned, dusty tome look these are books that look like books. The latest is a cheeky foldout number, complete with a pack of playing cards and comb. They may also chance upon Taschens table- sized Atlas Maior of 1665, a reprint of Joan Blaeus baroque masterpiece of it. The originals 596 maps came in 11 volumes, and kept Blaeus copperplate presses busy for 1, 600 days. Perhaps it is just coincidence that Taschen decided to republish it in the year that Google launched its virtual globe project, Google Earth. At 100 a copy, it may come cheap, but then the price has symbolic value quality out sell for 99. 99. The result of an even more painstaking piece of love is Audrey Niffeneggers The Three Incestuous Sisters. Her bestselling novel The Time Travelers Wife took five years to travel from the conception of its title to the bookshelves in Sainsburys no time at all, compared with her visual tale of jealous siblings, ghostly ancestors and flying babies. Using aquatint, she spent 14 years making ten copies. Before Cape decided to publish a cheaper mass market version, they sold for around 1,000 each. Collectors edition chic is also in vogue Zadie Smiths On Beauty, for example, comes complete with beautifully patterned endpapers a design quirk that one used to find almost exclusively in special editions. Even the booklets in Penguins Great Ideas series, with their proud typography and ornamental frames, look like the sort of thing that one would pick up at a fine press fair not a book chain. Waterstones picked up on the success of internet book auction sites earlier this year and started commissioning special editions from publishers. Commercially successful new titles from Kazuo Ishiguro to Lauren Bacall now come with a slightly more expensive collectable twin. Far from pushing traditional bookmaking to the edge, internet publishing seems to have breathed new life into it and reminded it of its strengths. Any of the above titles could make your iBook melt with envy, so self- assured are they in their celebration of the nostalgic, emotive qualities the book as a material object. Simon Prosser, the Penguin editor who decided to publish McSweeneys in Britain, says You can pick them up, put them down, take them to bed, admire the way has been conserved within their covers, show them off to your friends or smell the distinctive scent of print on paper. Books are sometimes more than the words they contain. Niffenegger, who has a professorship at the Columbia College Chicago Centre for Book and Paper Arts, agrees that the electronic book is still a long, while away. The internet is yet adapted to the human body, she says. The book is different even its different parts are named after parts of the human body. You have the head and the foot of the book, the spine, and the size is adapted to the size of your hands. This hands- on approach to bookmaking would have have struck a chord with William Morris, the late- nineteenth century socialist, textile designer and patron saint of the good page.

ENGLISH ASSASSIN
deaths than the last act of Hamlet. The more sympathetic of the killers is Gabriel Allon — who, as readers of earlier novels in the series will know, combines duties as an agent for the Israeli secret service with a no less demanding job as an art restorer. Summoned to clean a Raphael at the home of a wealthy Zurich banker, he finds himself framed for his murder. Released from custody after his handlers intervene, he decides to track down the real assassin with the assistance of his murdered patron's beautiful daughter, Anna, who happens to be a world-famous violinist. Meanwhile, Killer No 2 — referred to only as ""The Englishman"" - is relaxing after a hard day slitting the throats of Eta agents. Sooner or later, the two are going to cross swords, especially after Gabriel witnesses — and is nearly a victim of - an assassination set up by the Englishman. The money is always on Gabriel to win - if only because his presence will doubtless be required in more books; but it's touch-and-go for a few hundred pages. Further complicating the story is a dark family secret concerning stolen art treasures looted by the Nazis during the Second World War, and hidden in a Swiss bank vault; and there are some glamorous settings - Corsica, Portugal, Paris - to offset the gorier moments.

Yann Martel introduces an unique competition to find an illustrator for a new edition of his bestselling modern classic
The man, the book: Yann Mattel with his Booker Prize-winning classic
BEN GURR vvinnenof THE Mari'BOOKERlllflKiii & I m
THE WRITING AND TELLING OF stories is an inherently social act. You don't whisper a story to a glass of water, you whisper it, eventually, into someone's ear. Stories should be shared. When Life of Pi, my story of a 16-year-old boy named Pi stranded at sea with a Bengal tiger, won the 2002 Man Booker Prize, I was stunned. Now that The Times and my publishers, Canongate, are launching a competition to illustrate a new edition of Life of Pi, I'm excited: it's another way of sharing the story. In the three years I have spent travelling around the world talking about my book, readers' reactions have never failed to surprise me. After a reading in Berne, Switzerland, a woman raised her hand and asked me if this odyssey of a boy and a tiger in a lifeboat crossing the Pacific wasn't a metaphor on marriage. She explained that when you marry a man you have to feed him, clean up after him, train him, and then he leaves you without saying goodbye. She wasn't joking. And who am I to say she is wrong? There have been even stranger ones. A man once shoved a US stamp-collecting magazine at me in which he had written an article on Pi's relationship with the tiger, named Richard Parker, as the relationship of a stamp collector with his favourite stamp. The conclusion? You should always keep your favourite stamp, your star stamp. Once you put the story out there, it's up to the reader what happens next. How it is interpreted is no longer your affair — that's the other half of the deal. I loved the cover picture designed by Andy Bridge for the Canongate edition as soon as I saw it, and I told all my foreign publishers that they should take a look at it. Illustrations can only enhance the reader's experience. There is a wonderful tradition of complementing literature with dramatic images
— I remember reading illustrated versions of Jules Vern as a child — and believe that images will complement the imagination of the reader who reads Life of Pi. They will give the book an added quality, so that there is not only the aesthetic of the story but also something visual. For people reading the future edition there will not only be a platform of words for their imagination to jump from, but illustrations too. The only negative side, I suppose, is that pictures can limit readers, just as once a book is turned into a movie, people tend to visualise it in terms of the movie, rather than in the free flow of their own imagination. But I think that, like words, pictures are only the beginning: once readers see them, they will add details or disagree with certain details and it is this, the meeting between reader and book, that makes a book come to life. In this same sense, whoever wins this competition will meet my book and react with it. Whatever illustrations they come up with don't have to reflect how I see the book; it's all about how they see it. It is for this reason that I am very open-minded about the illustrations: whether they are lifelike or highly stylised; whether they are lush with colours or quite austere. That's precisely what is so exciting about the competition, to see what the people who enter will bring to it and how they will see the book. Not only in terms of the details — do they see the lifeboat the way I conceived it and the way I tried to convey it in words? — but beyond that. Beyond the anatomical correctness, the question is just how will they see it: what colours; what perspectives; what emotional tone? Will the tiger be menacing; will the ocean be threatening; will the island be something out of Frankenstein or will it be an Eden?

o CQ [—I
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, WHEN MY bookshelves are bursting and the piles next to them have reached skyscraper proportions, I embark on a cull. Five years ago I was in such a brutal frame of mind that I ended up giving 200 books to my local library (the librarian was a picture of diplomacy as she thanked me for my bizarre collection). But even then, when I am agonising over which of my many Pride and Prejudices should go (can you have too many?), certain volumes survive, despite the fact that I have never read them. Most of the time, I admit that I haven't read them only during these rather intense
I
book cull weekends. Otherwise, I convince myself that I have read them at some point but, for inexplicable reasons, cannot remember anything about them. Hemingway is on that list (I am really, really sure that I have read all ofhim). There are also lots of biographies (several involving Churchill) and quite a few novels by Thomas Hardy (surely I must have read all of Hardy at some point). I take these books on holiday year after year (some are so well travelled they deserve their own Air Miles accounts). The only one that I have ever read was Uncle Tom's Cabin and I felt so smug about it that it was like a drug. d
This year, however, I did not holiday as normal. My aversion to airports has become so acute that I decided to holiday at home, by which I mean Cornwall (with my name, it must have been home once upon a time). The only thing between me and St Just was a seven-hour drive that traditionally includes at least one nightmare tailback. I re ally did not think that my exhausted
Buddy Holly tape could be expected to do duty for the entire trip and so, almost by accident, I found myself browsing through the books on tape section of Waterstone's. What a revelation! There, before me, were all those books that I haven't read but think that I have. Plus there were even some, such as Ulysses, that even I know that I haven't read. I staggered out of the store, 30 POUNDS poorer, which seemed a bit extravagant given that I wasn't sure that it would be possible to concentrate on the stories and also devote sufficient mental energy to the art of spotting speed cameras on the A303. I am sure you will agree that, if push came to shove, I would have to abandon literature for speed camera duty. Happily, however, these tasks must use different bits ofthe brain, for I found it quite easy to do both. Within minutes, I had fallen in love with my new discovery. My first book was Far from the Madding Crowd, read by Julie Christie. Can there be any better way to travel through the West Country? I hardly even noticed the one-hour jam at Bodmin. I couldn't help but see, though, that the couple behind me looked to be on the brink of divorce. I felt like shouting: ""Don't try and talk to each other! Listen to Julie Christie and all will be fine!"" The book was almost over when I reached
g n es htd end e by t
St Just and so I sat in my car upon arrival and listened to the very end. The smug factor was very high. For now I had really read the book. What a relief! My next book, for the return journey, was Claire Tomalin's Samuel Pepys: The Unequalled Self. I never even bothered to buy the actual book for the simple reason that I knew that it was destined to live on the unread volume shelf. But the book is wonderful and I found myself the proud possessor of all kinds of information about Pepys and his extraordinary life and times. It was eight sides long and I never wanted it to
end. I had expected it to last me through my trip to Blackpool. By a cruel twist of fate, both the Liberal Democrats and the Tories are having their party conferences there this year and, as the Times sketchwriter, there was no escape. But how to get there? My last experience with trying to travel train on that line on a Sunday was so bad that it would require a pro¬
q fessional exorcist to rid me of the horror. There is always the plane, but there was my previously mentioned airport hatred. And driving is always a lottery, and can take 5 hours or 25 hours. But now I had Pepys to speed me on my way! Then, the day before I left, I realised that he had started to die. I was sad for him, obviously, but sadder for myself. For now I was committed to driving to Blackpool and I had no Pepys. It was too late to get to the shop and so I did something that I haven't done since 1998:1 went to the library and there, spread out before me, were even more tapes of books that I thought I had read but haven't. I listened to William Pitt the Younger, written and read by William Hague, on the way up. It was so entrancing that I missed the M6 turning. There were some rather good sketchwriters in the 1700s, it seems. But I had to ration the Pitt, as it has to last all the way back. To fill the time, I listened to Great Speeches in History. There was Socrates, Cicero, Martin Luther, et al. I'm not sure this was such a good idea for, in Blackpool, the oratory was not so soaring. My favourite may be the man who began his speech with the immortal words: ""Conference, I am a chartered accountant!""

Mary Lovell on a great book left in the shadows
Staying at a friend's house recentiy, I poked around in the landing bookshelf for bedtime reading. I settled on A Town Uke Alice, a novel based on real life, written by that supreme storyteller, Nevil Shute. I read it many years ago, but i had forgotten Shute's magic. He moves the reader from a dusty office in postwar London, which houses the solicitor who unfolds the story, to the foetid heat, horrors and tribulations of the Malayan jungle, where a group of European women and children, prisoners of the Japanese after the fall of Singapore, are forcibly marched hundreds of miles across the peninsula. Tropical disease, insect bites and malnutrition take their toil and the feisty young heroine Jean Paget takes over as leader of the diminishing group. At one point they meet several Australian PoWs on the road. Jean strikes up a friendship with one, Joe Harman, and tells him how she survives the heat by recalling sessions at the ice rink in Southampton. He tells her about his life on an Australian cattle station, but when a few days later he steals some chickens from the Japanese commander to feed Jean's group, he is caught and crucified. The women are made to watch before being driven off down the jungle tracks. Eventually, their guard dies and they are taken in by villagers who allow them to work in the paddy fields for their food until the Japanese surrender. After the war Jean inherits some money and returns to Malaya to build a well for the villagers who saved their lives. Then she decides to go on to Australia, where she finds that Joe did not die in the crucifixion, but is very much alive. In fact, he has sailed off to Southampton to find her.

THE SECRET UFE OF ARTHUR RANSOME BBC Two, 9.10pm Griff Rhys Jones (above) travels to Russia to tell the astonishing story of Arthur Ransome, the author whose novels — Swallows and Amazons, Coot Club and We Didn't Want to Go to Sea — have captivated thousands of middle-class ten-year-olds. Ransome, it transpires, was no Boy Scot In tweeds. He went to Russia for the first time in 1913 to get away from his wife, and ended up with a ringside seat at the Russian Revolution. He was recruited by British Intelligence, but fell in love with Trotsky's secretary. Although he was a man of exceptional courage and resourcefulness, It was never entirely clear which team he was supporting. Rhys Jones is an enthusiastic storyteller, and he tells a sensational story of intrigue and passion.
ASHES FEVER Channel 4, 4.10pm Highlights from this most gripping of Test series — from the nerve-shredding finishes at Edgbaston and Trent Bridge to the climax at the Oval - are given extra impact by the insights of those involved at first hand. How, for example, did England regroup after the humiliation at Lord's? How, in fact, did a series of cricket matches come to define the spirit of the summer of 2005? James Jackson m/50: ANT & DEC'S GAMESHOW MARATHON ITVl, 6.10pm Continuing ITV's season of self-congratulation, Ant and Dec celebrate some of the
channel's most popular game shows. The first on their list is The Price is Right, which will be played in front of a celebrity audience. Six audience members will be asked to join in, and the winners each week will go through to the next game.
These will include Bullseye, Play Your Cards Right, The Sale of the Century and Family Fortunes. But don't let me put you off. JUUAN FELLOWES INVESTIGATES A MOST MYSTERIOUS MURDER BBC One, 9.10pm As actors recreate the events surrounding a series of unsolved murders, the bestselling writer Julian Fellowes shimmers in and out of the action commenting on the events as they unfold. In 1902, a pregnant servant girl called Rose Harsent was stabbed to death in the middle of the night during a summer storm in a small Suffolk village. Her lover - a married man and a leading light in the Methodist chapel - was twice tried for her murder, but the jury was unable to reach a verdict. Fellowes offers his own theory about who was responsible, but there is still plenty of reasonable doubt. 02ZY OSBOURNE: IN MY UFE ITVL 10.10pm From abattoir worker in Birmingham to rock lunatic to eccentric national treasure, Ozzy Osbourne (below left) is perhaps most remarkable for his longevity. In this latest bout of indulgence (in a film named after his favourite Beatles song) he talks openly about such topics as his former alcoholism and drug addiction, his time in jail for the attempted murder of his wife Sharon, and how he lost his best friend and guitarist in a freak plane crash (the band's tour-bus driver was flying the plane at the time).

SAHIB: The British Soldier in India 1750-1914 by Richard Holmes CHILDREN OF THE RAJ by Vyvyen Brendon THE RAJ IS CLEARLY ALL the rage. Already this year we've had books on Thugs, curry and General Dyer, the perpetrator of the Amritsar massacre. And now two studies on the Indian experiences of two very different groups of Britons: soldiers and children. Richard Holmes's Sahib is very much a follow-up to his recent bestselling books on the British soldier in the preCrimean and First World War eras. He is canny enough to realise that colonial history is a minefield of national sensibilities and so chooses not to enter the lively debate about the ""rights or wrongs"" of the Indian Empire. Instead his book illuminates the ""central paradox"" of the Raj: how a relatively small number of soldiers gained and held most of the subcontinent for almost 200 years. It also explains why they went there, how they lived and how they died. As with previous studies, Holmes uses a thematic approach to contrast the different eras. The journey to India, for instance, shortens from a six-month voyage in a sailing vessel round the Cape of Good
Hope in the mid-18th century to just a matter of weeks in a steamer, via the Suez Canal, at the end of the 19th. The downside of this approach is that it sacrifices chronological order and narrative flow. Holmes partly gets round that by including, at the outset, a brisk overview of the many wars fought by the British in India before 1914. But in devoting so little space to such a huge period he is forced to rely on generalisation and, occasionally, misrepresentation. General Elphinstone is again fingered, unfairly in my opinion, as the villain ofthe disastrous retreat from Kabul in 1842; and the cartridges that sparked the mutiny at Meerut in 1857 are described as the ""new"" greased version when in fact they were the same ungreased bullets that the sepoys had been using for years. Yet so jaunty is Holmes's tone, so insightful his comments and so colourful, relevant and pithy his quotes that all is quickly forgiven. One of

Their superiors fared little better: between 1760 and 1834 only a tenth of officers reached retirement age. Nor were British children always safe. Ofthe several million who went out to India during British rule — so many, Vyvyen Brendon tells us in Children of the Raj, that ""almost every family in the country has some Indian connection"" — tens of thousands did not come back. The biggest killer, as always, was disease, but hazards included floods, earthquakes, snakes and war. The most brutal conflict was the Indian Mutiny of 1857 when, Brendon explains, the rebels targeted their rulers' offspring. She does not say as
much, but the reason for this policy of extermination was that it tarred all members of a mutinous regiment with the same brush and gave them nothing to lose by rebelling. Famously many British children were saved by loyal servants and the debt was repaid, at least in part, in 1947 when Britons hid retainers during the communal bloodshed between Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs. Most child casualties were infants: partly because they were weaker, and partly because most children over the age of 7 were educated in Britain. This could mean being separated from their parents for many years, and one of Brendon's chief preoccupations is to assess the psychological impact of such abandonment. She cites an academic study which concludes that many children of the Raj developed ""a detached character as a defence against the fear of rejection"", making it harder for
ing relationships. While her own interviewees do not conform to such a ""bleak picture"", a minority agree that their insecure childhoods have led to later ""trouble with relationships"". The flip side, says Brendon, is that the long British tradition of sending children away from their parents has helped to form the type of self-reliant, gritty national character that proved so useful in both world wars.

Margaret Reynolds examines the choices of a poll to find 'future classics'
WHAT MAKES A ""CLASSIC""? For me, it's a book that transcends its own time and context to speak to the anxieties of a different time and context. From next week I'll be writing about a different ""classic"" every week and I'll be asking that question: why should we still read this? What is it about One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest or The Divine Comedy that keeps them on our bookshelves, in our classrooms, open in our hands? The publishing imprint Vintage has been asking the same question — or a very similar one. To celebrate its fifteenth birthday next month Vintage has asked 500 readers from 48 reading groups across the country to nominate 15 of their titles as ""future classics"". Not their favourite book, not their marking-an-epoch-in-mylifetime book, not the book they most wish they had read if they were the person they wanted to be. Instead, readers were asked to think about what makes a classic, and to predict which titles will become classics. To start everyone off, Vintage sent the reading groups a longlist of 100 titles from its present catalogue. All the names are here, from Kingsley Amis to Toni Morrison. Some of the older books on the list are, arguably, already considered classics — To Kill a Mockingbird, for instance — but others, like Captain Corelli's Mandolin, are in the ""future"" category of books that are too young to have classic status, but might conceivably still be read and studied a hundred years from now. As Vintage acknowledges, and as I will show in my column, a book doesn't have to be huge and ancient to be a classic. The shortlist of 15, announced today, is telling. It is a very intellectual list — don't look for any light summer reads here unless you are prepared to take your dictionary and your brain to the beach. Which is not to say that these books are not enjoyable. There's plenty to laugh at even in the dystopian Brave New World. There's plenty to weep over in All Quiet on the Western Front and Birdsong. It's also a wideranging list, with books in translation and books set in Europe, America and the Far East. A clear set of themes comes out of the list. There are a number of books about war (Captain Corelli, Catch-22) — partly because we are all still coming to terms with the events of the past century. There are books that

deal with memory and its inconvenient slipperiness (The Time Traveler's Wife, Memoirs ofa Geisha). There are books about justice and injustice (To Kill a Mockingbird), about political exploitation (One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich), about change and loss (The Star of the Sea) and about hidden histories (The Name of the Rose). Over and again the question of point of view and testimony appears — in, for instance, Atonement or The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time or The French Lieutenant's Woman. Other key topics include: chance, mystery, time, identity, the child's-eye view, the failure — and the consolation — of love. One thing in particular stands out. All of these books are about storytelling — about how the story gets told, and by whom. In the early 21st century instant communication, rolling news, soap opera, propaganda and political spin have made us sophisticated readers of both truth and fiction. Sophisticated and wary. We have long been threatened with the demise of the book. But, as this list shows — just now, with so many interests competing to tell us their story their way — we need books about storytelling to help us learn how to read between the lines to get at the truth. Any book that can offer us a glimpse of that truth — across the boundaries of time and place — can justly be called a classic.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0502919496/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=01f1b0e6,"Up front Books you still read them tomorrow?

THE POSITION by Meg Wolitzer THE POSITION IN QUESTION is called Electric Forgiveness. It is, we are assured, ""a wonderful way to achieve climax quickly and lovingly after a scene of anger or stress"". It is offered up wholeheartedly to an eager public by Paul and Roz Mellow, who find themselves, in 1975, the bestselling authors of a groundbreaking sex manual called Pleasuring: One Couple's Journey to Fulfilment. Aside from examining their most intimate encounters in this very public way — made even more public by the graphic line drawings, unmistakably of Paul and Roz themselves, that accompany the text—the Mellows are a pretty ordinary couple. They have four kids: Holly, Michael, Dashiell and Claudia. They live in a big, comfortable house just outside New York City. Then they become avatars of the sexual revolution, and, as Meg Wolitzer's hilarious, humane and wonderfully serious novel relates, everything changes. Every so often a novel comes along that Everyone decides is an Important Novel. These Important Novels are meant to tell us something about the human condition, about our times, our mores, the
culture. Certainly: for that's what all novels try to do, though in general the best ones don't set out, self-consciously, to do it. Who is Everyone? You know: the usual cabal of critics, publishers and booksellers. These books, the Important Ones, usually have two things in common. The first is that they are, almost always, by Americans. What is it about Americans and their monopoly on state of the nation/soul? Roth, Updike, Bellow, Irving, Franzen, Eugenides: those are the boys who can tell us where it's at. Over on these shores there's a kind of desperate scrabble to find a British novelist who addresses, with equal (perceived) grandeur, ""large themes"": the laurel seems to have fallen, by default, on the brow of Ian McEwan, though his recent sanctimonious books are, alas, far less worthy of his readers' attention than his earlier, edgier works. The second thing they have in common is... well, you'll note that I wrote ""those are the boys"". Important Novels? Those would be by men, then. I'm sorry. In the main I like to think I believe in the level playingfield, but sometimes I despair. I know: we've had all this with the Orange Prize — the big literary award that only girls can win. Is this fair, goes the argument. Where's the prize for men? The answer comes: men do just fine, thanks, and anyhow all prizes have to make some sort of category selection. Is there a difference between ""women"" (the Orange) and ""British and Commonwealth writers"" (Man Booker)?

Michael is a software genius whose run-in with antidepressants has left him impotent; Dashiell is gay, which is fine, but he's also — horror of horrors! — a Republican. Claudia is — well, Claudia doesn't really know, and her character is one of the novel's most endearing. The mechanism of the novel is a publisher's desire to reprint Pleasuring for its 30th anniversary; this has the effect of bringing the family together. This is and isn't a book about sex. Sex is a metaphor, a motor; it can drive us and it can cost us dear. It can be communication and silence. Wolitzer, with wit and sensitivity, reminds her readers of its price, pain, and joy. Her characters are absolutely real and true: they come right off the page and speak to us, somehow, about our own lives while remaining, always, precisely themselves. This is no small gift in a novelist. This is one of the best and most human books I've read all year. Yet I found myself thinking that because its author fits into one of the categories I mentioned above (American) but not, crucially, the other (boy), it might not get, on either side of the Atlantic, quite the notice it deserves. I'm not saying it won't be praised; but that's different from being heralded as Important. But as women have for so long, perhaps Wolitzer will remind herself that power often operates most effectively by stealth, and will trust that in the end, no one could possibly see this as a ""girl's book"".",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0502915243/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=9d7e5ab0,"Up front Books The Mighty Wolitzer Its funny, wise and full of the richness and sadness of family life.

The mechanism of the novel is a publishers desire to reprint Pleasuring for its 30th anniversary this has the effect of bringing the family together. This is and dat a book about sex. Sex is a metaphor, a motor it can drive us and it can cost us dear. It can be communication and silence. Wolitzer, with wit and sensitivity, reminds her readers of its price, pain, and joy. Her characters are absolutely real and true they come right off the page and speak to us, somehow, about our own lives while remaining, always, precisely themselves. This is no small gift in a novelist. This is one of the best and most human books Ive read all year. Yet I found myself thinking that because its author fits into one of the categories I mentioned above American but not, crucially, the other boy, it might not get, on either side of the Atlantic, quite the notice it deserves. Im not saying it wont be praised but still different from being heralded as Important. But as women have for so long, perhaps Wolitzer will remind herself that power often operates most effectively by stealth, and will trust that in the end, no one could possibly see this as a girls book."

A Russian's
Boris Akunin is a sensation. He has created a popular hero to equal Sherlock Holmes and James Bond in his bestselling whodunnits. Giles Whittell met him
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO the Ukrainian mafia, broadly defined, paid Boris Akunin an elaborate compliment. It produced a book bearing his name. He didn't write a word of it, but someone did, by all accounts extremely badly. It has sold a few thousand copies and put Akunin in illustrious company: the Kievan mqb is also doing a brisk trade in something called The Last Merovingian, ""by"" Dan (da Vinci) Brown. Akunin relates this story indulgently, as well he might. Any damage being done to his reputation by Ukrainian conmeri will be easily outweighed by the English publication of The Death of Achilles, the fourth translated Volume in a series starring a foppish but tungsten-tipped tsarist detective who has already made Akunin rich, envied, happy and free to roam the real world in as much style as he used to roam the literary one. For those who haven't heard of this prodigiously productive pioneer of period post-Soviet crime fiction, a little background: he wrote his first novel, in six weeks flat, in 1998. He has since produced ten more in one series, four in two others and three in a fourth, the latter all written on a three-month P&O cruise last year, He writes in a blur of speed: two hours a day, after which he reckons to have ten typewritten pages ready for his publisher. He then reads (strictly nonfiction), drinks with friends and plays computer games. Akunin's finest creation and the star of his first 11 titles is Erast Fandoriri — genius, gentleman, polyglot, kickboxer and all-round inordinately lucky bloke. In Russia, three Fahdorin books have been made into films so far and two of them into television series as well. Outside Russia, Fandorin is coming sooner or later to a screen near you; Paul Verhoeven, who directed the notorious Basic Instinct, has the rights. Whatever you make of his writing, Akunin (real name: Grigory Chkartashvili) is a phenomenon; the only Russian writer to reach a mass audience abroad as well as domestically since the Soviet collapse. Each of his three titles already out in English (The Winter Queen Murder on the Leviathan and Turkish Gambit) has sold more than 50,000 copies in the UK alone In Russia, meanwhile, he has shifted more than 10 million books in seven years, and his success there says much about his perspicacity but even more about his country. It was all minutely planned on a premise that the new Russia has produced a new type of Russian who craves a hew type of reading. That's the perspicacity bit. And then the premise turned out to be correct. The middle class emerging from perestroika and the Yeltsin mess had Tolstoy and Dostoevsky on the one hand and pulp fiction on the other, but nothing in between. ""In Russia nowadays the middle class is the revolutionary class,"" Akuniyi says. ""It did not exist before It's very energetic very active arid
in need of everything a class needs, like ideology, ethics, aesthetics and, well, easy reading."" He's 49, married without kids, and looks in profile like a slimline, youthful Alfred Hitchcock. He talks quietly, with the fluency and concision of someone who's had time to organise what's in his head. We meet not in Moscow, where he lives, but in London, where he has been driven nuts all morning by a demolition crew bringing down an office block next to his corporate apartmerit near St Paul's. He peers round a blind and mutters that he ""never thought British workmen could be so industrious"". Not that he has any such illusions about his fellow writers. Not any more. When he identified the gap in the Russian book market that he has since filled, it was the mid-1990s. He wasan intellectual, supplementing a laughable wage as a literary editor by translating foreign fiction into Russian at ten pages an hour. Loath to sully his own keyboard with the breathless whodunnits he had in mind, he asked his mates to give them a try. ""They were talented writers, poets, critics, and at first I simply wanted to organise them to write this sort of fiction... But these Russian writers, they are so lazy."" So he offered to construct their plots for them. Still nb takers. ""After a while I'd had enough and decided to set an example, to write
^HeVnot very sure of himself, he doesnft always win*.
just one novel in the style that I mean, and that is how the first one appeared."" Russia has plenty of crime and crime writers, but no one had come up with anything like the Holmes-Bond^Oblonsky mix that is Fandorin. Akunin thinks this is because his creation embodies so much that modern Russians aren't. He's ""understated, dignified, reserved"". He's also the straight-up action hero whom Akunin never found in his own voracious reading of the Russian classics as a boy, unable to pick the wrong pistol in a dud arid so spiffing at martial arts (picked up on a six-year attachment to the Russian Embassy in Tokyo from which he returns at the beginning of The Death of Achilles) that he can do back-flips off the ceiling and whack you in the back of the neck on his way down. Yet Fandorin is still Russian, ""He is not very sure of himself. He's reflective. He doesn't always win, and when he does, sometimes he regrets it. This is one of the features typical of the Russian intelligentsia that I find attractive."" Fandorin's fey look is that of a scion of the von Meek family that befriended Tchaikovsky and built railways for Alexander II. Akunin picked up his portrait in a Moscow flea market.
Russian, un-Russian, whatever. Fandorin caught on, riot just because of who he is but when he operated. No one has revived the tsarist twilight with quite Akunin's energy and affection, which he insists is less for the period than the novels it produced. His books are adazzle with grandeur and grotesqueries borrowed joyfully from the greats, which most of his Russian readers know almost as well as he does. This saves space, he says, not joking. ""I just have to draw a few [word] pictures"" — of a befurred aristo pulling up outside a snowbound restaurant in the manner of Prince Oblonsky, say — ""and my reader knows exactly what sort of person this is. I don't have to spend pages and pages describing his or her life story."" It also transports the reader to a unique time between absolutism and the Soviet ice age when Russia was a place of wild schemes and optimism, not just those vast impersonal forces leading to 1917. A smart move simply from the point of view of reader morale, one would have thought. But Akunin also argues that his country was wrestling then with many of the issues that confront it now. It's a serious point and he offers an example in Dostoevksy's clairvoyant passages on modern political terrorism in The Devils. Not long ago, this might have been an attempt by Akunin to suggest some important purpose behind his new life as a bestseller writer. Not now, though. He is unembarrassed and delighted by his success. And somewhat reconciled to having spent the first half of his life trapped in the Soviet Union. ""When I was young I felt very sorry for myself that I was born in this awful, boring country,"" he muses. ""Now I think of this rather as a bonus, because growing up in a country like that stimulated your brain. You had to distance yourself from what was surrounding you, and besides, when you live in a quiet country you might live to the end of your life without really understanding what sort of person you are."" Ouch? It gets worse. In the West, says the sage from the country with an average male life expectancy of 57, people live till they die of Alzheimer's at 95 ""because their heart is strong and they have watched their cholesterol all their life without life ever really testing them"". Akunin has some experience of Western gerontocracy. The three volumes he knocked off last year, comprising a mini-series he has called Tiie Genres, sparked accusations in Russian papers that he was getting ""literary slaves"" (his own phrase) to do some of his work. Not true, he says. He wrote them all in a cabin on Deck 11 of the Aurora cruise liner on a roundthe-world tour from Southampton to Southampton, ""The average age of the passengers was about 85,'? he says, ""and it was an incredibly boring experience. It was the perfect setting for tik""

Nursing him was his beloved sister, Mary — herself on the verge of the fit of insanity that was td cause her, a year or two later, to murder their mother. Among the other characters who people this vividly realised world is the antiquarian bookseller and sometime forger William Ireland. The platonic but intense romance between the latter and Mary Lamb is the focus of the story, which ends — as, indeed, does the love affair — when Ireland is unmasked as a fraud and Mary, distracted by grief, commits the terrible crime for which she remains notorious. The author's re-creation of these events is masterly. His feeling for the language of his chosen period is as sharp as one has come to expect. But it is in the realisation of the characters — poor, troubled Mary and her dipsomaniac sibling; gifted, over-reaching Ireland, and a host of others — that Ackroyd excels.

Embattled as we are by the unintelligent prescriptions of the national curriculum, we desperately need good history books. Yet while nonfiction is storming ahead with series such as Terry Deary's Horrible Histories, historical fiction has never regained the heights it achieved in the 1960s when books by Geoffrey Trease, Roger Lancelyn Green and Rosemary Sutcliffe made us all history boys and girls. One writer who is helping to fill the gap is Caroline Lawrence, whose Roman Mysteries series deserves its devoted following. The Colossus of Rhodes takes our quartet of multicultural detectives out of the city and across the sea towards Greece, into danger at the hands of a brutal slave-dealer.

Sworn into the service of handsome Robert Dudley, she is sent as a Holy Fool to spy on Princess Mary Tudor, the forgotten heir to King Edward's throne. Instead of the tyrant of popular legend, Hannah finds a woman waiting for her chance and only wanting the best for the kingdom — while her sister Elizabeth longs for her death. Caught in the enmity between the rival daughters of Henry VIII and torn between her infatuation with Dudley and duty to her family, Hannah must find a safe path through a dangerous time.

Bird with a brain
The Penguin paperback, offering high culture at low cost, is 70 this month. John Sutherland and Stephen Bayley mark a proud chapter
It is, wrote Sir Stanley Unwin, easy to become a publisher, but devilish hard to remain one. Unwin was among the minority who managed to hang on and collect their publishing knighthood. So, even more successfully, was Sir Allen Lane, the founder of the Penguin empire. Penguin (now a segment of the Longman Pearson combine) celebrates its 70th year this month. Fruit-fly stuff compared with the Methuselahs of the trade, Cambridge and Oxford university presses, with their five centuries of trading. But in its three score and ten the cheeky Penguin has achieved more for the uplift ofthe British mind than even the leviathans of Oxbridge. When he retired in 1964, E.V. Rieu (the chief editor of Penguin Classics) hailed his list — headed by his own bestselling translation of TTie Odyssey — as ""the greatest educative force of the 20th century"". It was
not hype. Penguin's achievement was the more impressive in that Lane himself was no intellectual — there are probably penguins on the ice-floes of Antarctica better read than he. One of his colleagues doubted
gd if he'd ever read a book cover to cover. But he was, as Jeremy Lewis describes in The Life and Times of Allen Lane, ""shrewd"" and, if he didn't do Homer, he could ""read the spirit ofthe age"". In 1935 Lane saw what the age needed: good books, cheap books and lots of books. After spending a weekend visiting Agatha Christie, and urged on by his wife, the young publisher launched his pioneer batch of Penguins, including one by Christie, at a tanner apiece, in the ""3d and 6d"" emporium, Woolworths.

Thereafter it was up all the way — until, that is, last year when the firm's woes made headlines in the financial pages. Suddenly, it seemed, the Penguin was an endangered species. Heads rolled, takeovers were rumoured. Clouds gathered over 80 Strand. Typically, Penguin's recent problems arise from its attempting a daring leap forward — a new, high-tech warehousing system which, as such things do, went phut. That, and the strength of sterling (in an industry which exports about 40 per cent of its products) has rather scooped the icing off the birthday cake. Penguin has always taken chances; never stood still. There were, for example, the batch publications of classic authors — ten volumes of Shaw, Wells, Lawrence, slamming into the bookshops. There were any number of spun-off imprints with quaint ornithological names,
passed. He delegated command to editors of genius. He bureaucratised publishing. It was Penguin which (ironically) pioneered modernised warehousing at Harmondsworth, west of London, in the 1950s. That vast bookbarn gave them the volume capacity to feed the ""paperback revolution"". It was Penguin that redefined ""permissibility"" by daring to publish Lady Chatterley's Lover in 1960. When the list looked stuffy in the 1970s they imported an American whiz-kid, Peter Mayer, to shake them up. They
from Puffins (Penguins for juniors), through Pelicans (Penguins for egg-heads) to Peregrines (Penguins for students). Only the tiny peewit remains un-Penguined. Lane realised that the days of the ""dynastic"" house (with its trailing ""and sons"") had
forged a trendsetting Anglo-American alliance with Viking. Think of a smart move in publishing and Penguin got there first. Above all, its product was superb. It published only the best books, new and reprint. The Penguin imprint gave you hardback quality at paperback price (the price of 20 cigarettes was Lane's rule of thumb — it still holds, almost). Staying at the top is hard. Competitors are always seeking to beat you at your own game. The reading public is fickle. Over the decades Penguin has never adulterated its product, but it has lost the supremacy it once enjoyed. Bookshops no longer have their ""Penguin section"". It used to be that Penguin meant paperback. Now itjust means one brand of paperback. To commemorate this anniversary year the firm is making a determined effort to regain its former brand supremacy. Its strategy is what it has traditionally been: carpet-bombing the market with quality books. Over recent months we have had a blockbuster batch of ten volumes by H. G. Wells, in special dump-bins, and the new Penguin Classics livery — blood red and Belgian chocolate dark. It will get a collateral boost from Spielberg's War of fhe Worlds later this year. More ambitious are two series, intended to retake the intellectual and cultural high ground that Penguin has always seen as its own. The first is the ""Great Ideas"" series, with 20 titles ranging from Seneca's On The Shortness of Life (read it, you publishers) to The Communist Manifesto, to Woolf, Freud and Orwell. The other series is 70 ""Pocket Penguins"" with a line-up that resembles the Sergeant Pepper cover. Here comes everybody, from Homer (in the cave of the Cyclops), to Kafka (at The
<NEWPAGE>
Great Wall of China), to India Knight (shopping in Selfridges) and Jamie Oliver (cooking for the weekend). The books are beautiful to look at and lovely to hold. The design of the Great Ideas titles harks back to the austerely handsome typographical jacket that Lane preferred. That ofthe Pocket Penguins has the jazziness that one associates with the most brilliant of Lane's editors, Tony Godwin. As a mark of confidence that great books speak for themselves, there is no apparatus. One thing marks these series out from the Penguin of yore. They are short on words. At 54 pages of text, the Pocket titles represent an hour's unstrenuous reading. Nor are Great Ideas, at 100 pages, greatly strenuous. In most cases, what the editors have done is fillet a sample taster. Thus Gibbon's massive The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is represented by a snippet on The Christians and the Fall of Rome. These are not books; they are booklets. But they are in keeping with ""the spirit ofthe age"" — our age. Penguin, innovative as ever, is tabloidising book publishing. Of course, people will still read big books — even The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. And they will find those big books in the Penguin catalogue. But in between the main events, the modern reader wants fast reads that stretch the mind, not fill it. What to call these latest Penguins? How about Peewits. JS versities, but I learnt more from Penguin than A COVER STORY Three shillings and sixpence. Britain's coinage went decimal only in 1971 and, for anybody at school before then, 17.5p was the price of entry into a well-designed world of modern novels, need-to-know classics, literate crime, serious history and real poetry. Three shillings and sixpence bought access to great writing and great ideas and, incidentally, a teach-yourself guide to the best in contemporary graphics as well. This was what you paid for a Penguin paperback. I went to a good school and two good unifrom any teacher or lecturer. After all, I had my own library. Appropriately, in this context, it was the Penguin edition of Sartre's Nausea that taught me what ""autodidact"" meant. Looking at a bookstore in 2005 with its ziggurats of .profligate, foil-blocked, shrink-wrapped ""product"" piled high in a polychrome clamour
of sensational claims and seductive offers, it is hard to recall what that retail landscape looked like 40 years ago. Outside London or the big university towns, bookshops were rare. You really had only W. H. Smith, in any case more interested in selling stationery and weird-smelling gardening magazines with gravure illustrations than books. It was in suburban Liverpool that I discovered Penguin when I precociously bought the new edition of Nikolaus Pevsner's Pioneers of Modern Design in the same year that I had cannily bought the last edition of The Times with classifieds on its front page. A habit was formed. I haunted Smiths, wait¬
ing for each month's batch of new Penguins, which duly arrived, high-concept capsules of style and writing, to release me from a dingy environment and arrange internal transport to Graham Greene's Cuba or Andrew Marvell's garden. Bright kids in the late Sixties also learnt from The Sunday Times Magazine (where Mark Boxer was editor) and from BBC2's Late Night Line-Up (where Joan Bakewell was the thinking man's English muffin), but they learnt most of all from Penguin Books. Allen Lane did not invent the paperback, but he did realise its potential. Paperbacks had hitherto been cheap or inferior. Lane saw them as something in their own right, a consumer product that needed to be packaged, branded, promoted and distributed as professionally as soap. Design could help. And 1935, when the first
< a, o x v- PKXi ARIEL ANDRE MAU ROIS -< X o o
Penguin appeared, was just the moment that that quintessential media professional, the graphic designer, was emerging as an autonomous, stylish creative figure from the anonymity of the print trade with its hot metal, warehouse coats, glue and cloth bindings. The first ten Penguins (Maurois's Ariel was the actual number one) were designed in-house and were distinguished enough with their tripartite grid, agreeable proportions and strong Gill Sans type (Times New Roman for body copy). But Lane was ever more ambitious. He failed to lure Oliver Simon from the Curwen Press, so travelled, instead, to Switzerland, the scriptural home of modern typography. Here he found Jan Tschichold, the son of a Leipzig signwriter. Tschichold's visit to the first Bauhaus exhibition in 1923 inspired a polemical manifesto called Elementare Typographic that same year. Three years later, Tschichold published Die neue Typographic, a persuasive, instructive and authoritative account ofthe benefits of uncluttered book design. In 1947 Tschichold joined Penguin and brought the Bauhaus to the British bookstore, transforming national taste with his strict grids, severe typography and disciplined layouts as much as Allen Lane transformed national literacy with Penguin's ever expanding, easily accessible list of established classics and imaginative commissioning. Penguin succeeded because, without being patronising or condescending, it flattered the consumer. It is one ofthe most compelling case studies in the effectiveness of design in the service of sales. Thirty years before Terence Conran's Habitat showed that British consumers would buy decent modern furniture if offered it, Allen Lane had established the principle with books. And after Tschichold's stern typography there were other influences. In 1960 a protean Italian called Germano Fagetti was appointed creative director and Penguin became a design academy. Anybody with a run of Penguins from the Sixties and Seventies has a collection of cover art that is the history of graphics in miniature. Alex Comfort's Sex in Society (1964) had a cover by Jock Kinneir, who designed Britain's motorway signs. Updike's Rabbit Run cover was illustrated by Milton Glaser, who later gave the world the famous Dylan posters and that annoying ""I Love NY"" motif with a heart icon replacing the L-word. Galbraith's American Capitalism (1970) was by Alan Fletcher, Britain's greatest graphic designer. Even more interesting was the adroit use of historical reference: the Sutton

In 1946 (when Penguin published its first classic, a new translation of The Odyssey) the V&A organised an exhibition called ""Britain Can Make It"". With Penguin, we always want to make connections. This exhibition led to the Festival of Britain five years later. But in 1951 Penguin launched its own more serious and more influential festival of national pride: in",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0503441612/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=c5296386,"review books Bird with a brain The Penguin paperback, offering high culture at low cost, is 70 this month.

One of of his colleagues doubted gd if he ever read a book cover to cover. But he was, as Jeremy Lewis describes in The Life and Times of Allen Lane, shrewd and, if he could do Homer, he could read the spirit other age. In 1935 Lane saw what the age needed good books, cheap books and lots of books. After spending a weekend visiting Agatha Christie, and urged on by his wife, the young publisher launched his pioneer batch of Penguins, including one by Christie, at a tanner apiece, in the 3d and 6d emporium, Woolworths. zzzzzzz zz, zz zz zmm reap a nm 0WEft TO COWEft IES IF UPP Thereafter it was up all the way until, that is, last year when the firms woes made headlines in the financial pages. Suddenly, it seemed, the Penguin was an endangered species. Heads rolled, takeovers were gone. Clouds gathered over 80 Strand. Typically, Penguins recent problems arise from its attempting a daring leap forward a new, high- end warehousing system which, as such things things do, went away. That, and the strength of sterling in an industry which exports about 40 per cent of its products has rather scooped the icing off the birthday cake. Penguin has always taken chances never stood still. There were, for example, the batch publications of classic authors ten volumes of Shaw, Wells, Lawrence, slamming into the bookshops. There were any number of spun- off imprints with quaint ornithological names, passed. He delegated command to editors of genius. He he publishing. It was Penguin which ironically pioneered the warehousing at Harmondsworth, west of London, in the 1950s. That vast ly gave them the volume capacity to feed the paperback revolution. It was Penguin that redefined permissibility by daring to publish Lady Chatterleys Lover in 1960. When the list looked stuffy in the 1970s they imported an American whiz- kid, Peter Mayer, to shake them up. They from Puffins Penguins for juniors, through Pelicans Penguins for egg- heads to Peregrines Penguins for students. Only the tiny peewit remains the- Penguined. Lane In that the days the days of the dynastic house with its trailing and sons had forged a trendsetting Anglo- American alliance with Viking. Think of a smart move in publishing and Penguin got there first. Above all, its product was superb. It published only the best books, new and reprint. The Penguin imprint gave you hardback quality at paperback price the price of 20 cigarettes was Lanes rule of thumb it still holds, almost. Staying at the top is hard. Competitors are always seeking to beat you at your own game. The reading public is fickle. Over the decades Penguin has never adulterated its product, but it has lost the supremacy it once enjoyed. Bookshops no longer have their Penguin section. It used to be that Penguin meant paperback. Now it means one brand of paperback. To commemorate this anniversary year the firm is making a determined effort to regain its former brand supremacy. Its strategy is what it has traditionally been carpet- bombing the market with quality books. Over recent months we have had a blockbuster blockbuster batch of ten volumes by H. G. Wells, in special dump- bins, and the new Penguin Classics livery blood red and Belgian chocolate dark. It will get a collateral boost from Spielbergs War of The Worlds later this year. More ambitious are two series, intended to retake the intellectual and cultural high ground that Penguin has always seen as its own. The first is the Great Ideas series, with 20 titles ranging from Senecas On The Shortness of Life read it, you publishers to The Communist Manifesto, to Woolf, Freud and Orwell. The other series is 70 Pocket Penguins with a line- up that resembles the Sergeant Pepper cover. Here comes everybody, from Homer in the cave of the Cyclops, to Kafka at The Great Wall of China, to India Knight shopping in Selfridges and Jamie Oliver cooking for the weekend. The books are beautiful to look at and lovely to hold. The design of the Great Ideas titles harks back to the austerely handsome typographical jacket that Lane preferred. That is Pocket Penguins has the jazziness that one associates with the most brilliant of Lanes editors, Tony Godwin. As a mark of confidence that great books speak for themselves, there is no apparatus. One thing marks these series out from the Penguin of yore. They are short on words. At 54 pages of text, the Pocket titles represent an hours of reading. Nor are Great Ideas, at 100 pages, greatly strenuous. In most cases, what the editors have done is fillet a sample taster. Thus Gibbons massive The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is represented by a snippet on The Christians and the Fall of Rome. These are not books they are booklets. But they are in keeping with the spirit iv age our age. Penguin, innovative as ever, is not book publishing. Of course, people will still read big books even The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. And they will find those big books in the Penguin catalogue. But in between the main events, the modern reader wants fast reads that stretch the mind, not fill it. What to call these latest Penguins? How about Peewits. JS all, but I learnt more from Penguin than A COVER STORY Three shillings and sixpence. Britains coinage went decimal only in 1971 and, for anybody at school before then, 17. 5p was the price of entry into a well- designed world of modern novels, need- to- know classics, literate crime, serious history and real poetry. Three shillings and sixpence bought access to great writing and great ideas and, incidentally, a teach- yourself guide to the best in contemporary graphics as well. This was what you paid for a Penguin paperback. I went to a good school and two good for any teacher or lecturer. After all, I had my own library. Appropriately, in this context, it was the Penguin edition of Sartres Nausea that taught me what autodidact meant. Looking at a bookstore in 2005 with its name of. profligate, foil- blocked, shrink- wrapped product piled high in a polychrome and of sensational claims and seductive and seductive offers, it is hard to recall what that retail landscape looked like 40 years ago. Outside London or the big university towns, bookshops were rare. You really had only W. H. Smith, in any case more interested in selling stationery and weird- smelling gardening magazines with gravure illustrations than books. It was in suburban Liverpool that I discovered Penguin when I precociously bought the new edition of Nikolaus Pevsners Pioneers of Modern Design in the same year that I had cannily bought the last edition of The Times with classifieds on its front page. A habit was formed. I haunted Smiths, wait ing for each months batch of new Penguins, which duly arrived, high- concept capsules of style and writing, to release me from a dingy environment and arrange internal transport to Graham Greenes Cuba or Andrew Marvells garden. Bright kids in the late Sixties also learnt from The Sunday Times Magazine where Mark Boxer was editor and from BBC2s Late Night Line- Up where Joan Bakewell was the thinking mans English muffin, muffin, but they learnt most of all from Penguin Books. Allen Lane did not invent the paperback, but he did not its potential. Paperbacks had hitherto been cheap or inferior. Lane saw them as something in their own right, a consumer product that needed to be packaged, branded, promoted and distributed as professionally as soap. Design could help. And 1935, when the first a, o x v- PKXi ARIEL ANDRE MAU ROIS- X o o Penguin appeared, was just the moment that that quintessential media professional, the graphic designer, was emerging as an autonomous, stylish creative figure from the anonymity of the print trade with its hot metal, warehouse coats, glue and cloth bindings. The first ten Penguins Mauroiss Ariel was the actual number one were designed in- house and were distinguished enough with their tripartite grid, agreeable proportions and strong Gill Sans type Times New Roman for body copy. But Lane was ever more ambitious. He failed to lure Oliver Simon from the Curwen Press, so travelled, instead, to Switzerland, the scriptural home of modern typography. Here he found Jan Tschichold, the son of a Leipzig Press. Tschicholds visit to the first Bauhaus exhibition in 1923 inspired a polemical manifesto called Elementare Typographic that same year. Three years later, Tschichold published Die are Typographic, a persuasive, instructive and authoritative account ing benefits of uncluttered book design. In 1947 Tschichold joined Penguin and brought the Bauhaus to the British bookstore, transforming national taste with his strict grids, severe typography and disciplined layouts as much as Allen Lane transformed national literacy with Penguins ever expanding, easily accessible list of established classics and imaginative commissioning. Penguin succeeded because, without being oppress or condescending, it flattered the consumer. It is one the most compelling case studies in the effectiveness of design in the service of sales. Thirty years before Terence Conrans Habitat showed that British consumers would buy decent modern furniture if offered it, Allen Lane had established the principle with books. And after Tschicholds stern typography there were other influences. In 1960 a protean Italian called Germano Fagetti was appointed creative director and Penguin became a design academy. Anybody with a run of Penguins from the Sixties and Seventies has a collection of cover art that is the history of graphics in miniature. Alex Comforts Sex in Society 1964 had a cover by Jock Kinneir, who designed Britains motorway signs. Updikes Rabbit Run cover was illustrated by Milton Glaser, who later gave the world the famous Dylan posters and that annoying I Love NY motif with a heart icon replacing the L- word. Galbraiths American Capitalism 1970 was by Alan Fletcher, Britains greatest graphic designer. Even more interesting was the adroit use of historical reference the Sutton the year of Skylon, the first volumes in Pevsners astonishing Buildings ofEngland appeared. The entire Penguin edifice is described in a meticulous and inspiring book. Penguin By Design A Cover Story 1935- 2005 by Phil Baines respects all the Penguin principles. Except one.

You will have read, in Tom Brown, how I was expelled from Rugby for drunkenness, which is true enough, but when Hughes alleges that this was the result of my pouring beer on top of gin-punch, he is in error. I knew better than to mix my drinks, even at 17. ""I mention this in the interests of strict truth. This story will be completely truthful; I am breaking the habit of 80 years.

How does a writer achieve cult status? By being Will Self or dreaming up Discworld? Erica Wagner seeks out the stars with exclusive appeal
ALLEN GINSBERG/CORBIS « ^
Tripping: a shirtless Neal Cassady with Timothy Leary, the LSD guru, in Ken Kesey's psychedelic bus in 1964
I called A. L. Kennedy to see how she would define the term ""cult fiction"". What made a cult author? ""Someone with a loyal, slightly flaky following,"" she offered. ""I was defined as cult when they thought that might work, because my fan base is loyal and flaky. You'd hope it meant that certain books were looked after and cherished by readers in the face of public opinion — but more and more that's happening full stop: the idea of reading non-bestselling fiction, the stuff that isn't on Richard and Judy, is becoming a kind of cult in itself."" A somewhat despairing take; but one that must be allowed given the impossibility, it seems to me, of any kind of narrow definition. The new Rough Guide to Cult Fiction is just published —we print some examples of quirky writing lives opposite — and causes a reader to ask: just what do they mean? The editors note in an introduction that Toby Litt once said that in their purest form, cult books ought to have been out of print for ten years — and that might be a good way to start. By those lights, though, this is no rough guide: Jonathan Franzen, author of the bestselling, Oprah-impressing The Corrections, a cult author? I wouldn't have thought so, but you'll find him in these pages. A. S. Byatt was as puzzled as I was when I
remarked on Franzen's inclusion. I wondered if (aside from a desire the editors might have felt to put into their book authors at least some people had heard of — though you could argue that defeats the object; OK, we could go around in these circles for ever) there might be some confusion between cool and cult. Franzen: cool, yes; cult, no. Byatt herself doesn't appear in these pages, and yet when she described the behaviour of some of her fans to me there was something cultish to it. There's a woman in California who makes ftirniture based around Possession; another in New York who makes tapestries drawing on all of Byatt's oeuvre. She didn't think that sales were necessarily anything to do with the matter: she considers one of her favourite authors, the bestselling Terry Pratchett, a cult author because readers either adore him or feel completely excluded from his work. When she travels in America and sings his praises, no one has ever heard of him. But aspiring to cult status, she thinks, can be dangerous. She is a great admirer of the novelist Tibor Fischer; but felt worried by her certainty that ""he would love to have a cult"". Will Self, at least according to the editors ofthis guide, has one: he's included. How does he feel .about that? ""I'm happy tp be
included in anything,"" he says. ""I was the boy who wasn't picked for sports at school."" According to Self, ""cult"" is a genre like any other ""a kind of sanitised avant-garde"". Inquiring after the Rough Guide's standards, Kennedy fired off a series of four names, only one of which met the RG's criteria, whatever they might be. For the record, that was James M. Cain, author of The Postman Always Rings Twice. The others were: Venedikt Yerofeev (the author of Moscow Stations); Boris Vian (""pataphysician, trumpeter, writer and bon vivant,"" it says on one website), author of I Spit on Your Graves; and Frederick Exley,- American author of A Fan's Notes_ and Pages from a Cold Island. As she noted, the advent of the internet has made seeking out ""cult authors"" much easier than it used to be. In a sense, each book that speaks strongly to an individual reader creates its own cult: there can be many subcults along the way. A simple ""I have heard of him, you haven't"" might be a good definition of cult — then nearly anyone can be let into this somehow elite and yet infinitely expandable club.

In fact, this new edition of The Bent Lens takes account of a further development: ""new queer cinema"", whose advent was noted by an ever-alert critical fraternity in 1992. The encyclopaedia's remit is broad, covering both films where sexuality is the central theme and those where it is more tangential. American Beauty is there for its male kiss — although the bits I was awake for suggested that its main argument was something else. And then there are films such as the wonderful American comedy But I'm a Cheerleader, about a holiday camp to which parents send their children for the correction of early signs of homosexuality, where gayness is the core subject of the film.
Going back in time, in movies as in other art forms, coyness, obliqueness or symbolism were unavoidable for the representation of gay themes. In the Sixties, mainstream movies were just about out of the closet, with films such as V7ct/m, The Children's Hour and The Killing of Sister George. But before that, social pressures^ when dealing with the love that dare not speak its name resulted in such bizarre artefacts of high camp as Nicholas Ray's kinky western Johnny Guitar, where Marlboro Country offers something quite different from your average swarthy, cigarette-puffing hero. The Bent Lens also tries to out certain films that I would never have suspected qf harbouring such tendencies — John Ford's The Long Voyage Home for one. A much better candidate would have been Hitchcock's Rebecca, in which Laurence Olivier is camper than a row of tents and Mrs Danvers's feelings for her late mistress are clearly not the usual ones between a housekeeper and her employer.

at the memoir it is loosely based on, Until the Final Hour by Traudl Junge. She was Adolf Hitler's secretary from November 1942 until her employer shot himself in April 1945, and was present in the bunker in Berlin when he did it. Downfall, despite being in German, will probably reach a wider public, but it is Junge's apparently artless memoir that provides the subtler and more perceptive portrait of the seductiveness of Nazism — written by someone who was herself seduced, and was racked with guilt over it right up to her death in 2002. For one thing it was written in 1947, before reactions to the Nazi experience had been channelled into their prescribed forms. In the film we see Hitler on the edge of reason, twitching, ranting, arbitrarily arresting and appointing, flailing, foundering and foaming.

My first novel, thank God, was never published. The typescript still lies at the bottom of some drawer box, its pages no doubt yellow and impregnated with dust I have not destroyed it because, even though ashamed, I am grateful to it Even the shame is a mixed feeling. I still feel slightly appalled that I could have dared to try to write a novel, having failed both my English
and history A levels at Winchester—a rare distinction which pleased neither parents nor school. Even with the advantage of hindsight, I can do no more than attribute this arbitrary decision to write to the utter ignorance and arrogance of youth. And yet if I had realised for a moment how utterly disqualified I was, life would have been sadly different. Careers can turn out to be such curious, unpredictable creatures, almost with a life of their own. As a child, I had Perthes disease, in which the hip bone goes soft. I was

DAVID ALMOND
Some folk thought I was mad when I quit my teaching job, sold my house and took up residence in a Norfolk commune. I was 30, and had published a handful of short stories in little magazines. The year that followed was idyllic. I helped to revive the commune's ancient overgrown garden, to renovate its ruined mansion. I wrote more stories. I fell in love. But as winter came, the commune started to founder on infighting and disillusionment. I left with my girlfriend and a woodturner and his gentle dog, and we rented a half-ruined Suffolk farmhouse. Months passed. The proceeds from the sale of my house declined. All of us were on the dole. We were very happy. I worked in a little timber-panelled room while hail pattered on the windows and the frosts came and went One day, almost in a dream, I wrote a story called Where Your Wings Were, which left me in tears. It grew out of the death of my sister in my childhood. It seemed so personal, so simple, so innocent. I could do nothing with it. I put it away. As the year turned, a letter arrived. It was from Peter Mortimer, the editor of the small northeastern Iron Press. He wanted to publish a collection of my stories. That evening, we cycled across the icy farm tracks to the pub in St James. We drank to literary celebrity and bestsellerdom, then we wobbled and skidded home again. Next day, I started to consider the contents of the book and didn't even think of finding a place for the story with the wings. It would take two years for the book to appear. By then, my money had gone. The book was called Sleepless Nights, it was 80 pages long, 500 copies were printed, and I was paid £50. But this little book, my first, helped to keep me calm and optimistic in the years that followed. I published more stories in more magazines. I had readers, even a handful of fans. I taught parttime. I wrote a novel, Seances, that was rejected by every UK publisher. One evening I found Where Your Wings Were in an old box file. The years had given it some distance from me. I rewrote it and sent it to Radio 4. It was broadcast The little story, left alone in the dark for so long, was proving to be some kind of seedbed. I rewrote it again, and a cluster of new, unbidden stories called Counting Stars grew out from it and from my childhood. When these were done, a new tale grew, about a boy with a poorly sister and about a creature with wings. When this book, Skellig, was published by Hodder, I was called a new writer. It was as-
MARGARET ATWOOD
The book appeared when I was 21. If it can be called appearing, that is. The location was Toronto, not at that time — to the naked eye — a hotbed of literary activity. They were still telling ""the Toronto joke"", then: first prize a week in Toronto, second prize two weeks in Toronto. If you were a young person who was serious about writing, you were expected to flee the place like a rat in the Dracula shipwreck scene, and that I duly did. But not before I had published this book. By ""published"", I mean that the book in question was sold in bookstores and reviewed in at least one periodical. It was not otherwise published. True to the Zeitgeist, I took a hand in the book-making: most young Canadian poets then

did something ofthe sort, as the few extant publishers were not clamouring for their wares. The book consisted of seven poems — short poems, luckily — for which I had won a university prize. It was printed in a cellar, on a flatbed press owned by a friend and colleague. Along with a fellow poet, I set the type. We had to do each poem separately, as there was a shortage of letter As. We ground out 300 copies of each poem, then folded the pages and stapled them together. The final edition was about 250, due to attrition. The cover was done with a lino-block: I carved the block, then set it into the flatbed. The stapled pages were glued into the cover with rubber cement — a mistake, because the glue dried out, as well as smelling odd. Then — how did I get the nerve? — I actually went around to various bookstores and got them to place the book. Bookstores were different then: small, individually owned, run by kindly gnomes with a tolerance for eccentricity. They must have thought that I was a fool or a lunatic, or — in the Toronto parlance ofthe day — ""different"", but this did not seem to bother them. As the book was small, it sold for 50 cents. I should have kept 249 of the things, as the price has now gone up considerably. The title of this tiny but peculiar effort was Double Persephone; the poems rhymed and scanned, and were about sex and death, with some rebirth tossed in: my optimism was showing early. As I recall, the word chthonic was in them, so it was pretty deep stuff. What do I think of them now? They weren't very good, but at least they were — oh, killing term — promising. I've been cheered up since by reading the juvenilia of other poets whose mature work I admire: Tennyson, for instance, has one that begins, ""Airy, fairy Lilian"". Best advice for young writers? This is a risky business. You're on a tightrope. Below is Niagara Falls. Courage. One step at a time. Don't look down. Margaret Atwood's latest novel is Oryx and Crake (Virago, £7.99; offer, £6.79)

/e books review
would you take your own books with you? We laughed, and said no. My first book was lucky to come out at all, first because it was a collection of short stories. These are doomed in the trade, as all short story writers know, because publishers are constantly telling us so. Short stories ""don't sell; readers don't buy them because readers don't like them"". Actually, readers tend to love short stories. Everywhere I go, and everywhere I read to audiences, audiences tell me they love short stories. You'd never know this from, for example, The Big Read, because if you voted for a book of short stories on this scheme your vote was automatically discounted. No small reads allowed. It's harder to find short stories in bookshops. They go almost immediately on publication straight on to the shelves, whereas novels tend to lie around on tables and in display units for months, so there's hardly any browser purchase on stories. They get less review coverage. Publishers tend to pay much less for marketing them via book reps and sellers. Publishers would soon change their tune about short stories if there was, say, a major money prize, or a short story category on the Whitbread. I sent out my first collection, Free Love and Other Stories, to several publishers in 1994 and kept getting the same kind of letter back. We like these, but they're short stories. Can you write a novel? Eventually Virago took a chance and accepted them. I was ecstatic. I went to their offices in Camden and met my future editor, Ruth Petrie. The next day I heard she'd left and the company was going bankrupt. Oh, no! Then Virago got bought by a conglomerate. My book was sure to get lost in the scrum, I thought. But doughty Lennie Goodings brought it out, a small print run in a quite unusual shape, long and thin. Lennie kindly let me have the cover I wanted, a picture of Louise Brooks from the G. W. Pabst film Diary of a Lost Girl (1929). There were a few reviews. It won a prize. Virago was pleased. They asked: next time, can you write a novel? AH Smith's latest book is The Whole Story and Other Stories (Penguin, £7.99; offer, £6.79)
sumed that it must be my first book. No one had heard ofthe little Iron Press or the little Sleepless Nights. But both books shared a starting point in a room in an ancient Suffolk farm, and both were similarly important to me, in building that unpredictable pursuit called a literary career.

My first published book was a long time coming. I wrote a novel when I was 15 or 16. It was penned longhand on stolen school jotters, and concerned a teenager who, misunderstood in his small-town home, flees to the seedy glamour of London, where he ends up jumping into the Thames and drowning. My follow-up was a themed collection — poems, short stories and a novella — on the loose subject of room/space. The novella was an updating of Lord of the Flies to a comprehensive school, where a poster of Mick Jagger was having a demonic influence on the younger kids,. So far, so bad. When I reached university, I drifted from the novel to the poem. (I say ""novel"", but doubt that these early efforts would have stretched beyond 20 or 30 typed pages.) I was 22 when I started work on a comedy set in a Highland hotel. It was called Summer Rites and featured a one-legged, schizophrenic librarian, a famous American author kidnapped by the paramilitary wing of the Scottish National Party, and a young kid with paranormal powers. I sent this off to various publishers, none of which could see the genius of the piece. It probably didn't help that, although the thing was put together on a typewriter, I had yet to learn to put a space after each punctuation mark and two after a period. (It was single-spaced to boot.) Putting Summer Rites behind me, I started work on a long short story, which eventually became the opening section of The Flood. I was 23 and doing a doctoral thesis on the novels of Muriel Spark. But really I was spending more time on my own writing. Living in Edinburgh, I peered enviously across to Glasgow, where writers such as Alasdair Gray and James Kelman were igniting Scottish fiction. No more Miss Jean Brodies. The Flood was a fairly traditional narrative, a typical Bildungsroman in that it dealt with the town of my youth, none too well disguised. When the novel was finished, I took it in person to a publisher called Polygon. At that time, Polygon had just published Kelman's first collection of short stories, and was about to publish his first novel. Moreover, it was owned by the Edinburgh University Students' Publication Board. Soon, I began hearing rumours that the book would be accepted. The letter arrived at my bedsit, announcing that Polygon would be happy to print up 200 hardbacks and 800 paperbacks. They would pay me £200.
I've never sat down and re-read any of my own books. Why would I? I still remember them pretty much off by heart. I know what happens in them. I'd want to change things. I'd just get annoyed with myself. Maybe when I'm an old old lady in my nineties, if I live that long, I'll look at them again. But I doubt it; I think there'll always be something else, new or old, I'd rather read. Gertrude Stein on her death bed lamented the shortness of life and the too-many-books of it. Why would you ever want to read your own? When the first bound copy comes through the door from the publisher, that's it — finished. I was recently on a Desert Island books panel at the Edinburgh Festival with a couple of other writers; someone in the audience asked,

■ Sunita hasn't had the best week on Coronation Street: tied up, tortured, and then set on fire by her love-rival Maya. So, a relief to know that in quieter moments the actress who portrays her, Shobna Gulati, is writing her first novel. ""I've been working on it today,"" Gulati tells me, ""and it's going well. I've written quite a lot of it already and I returned to it recently after a long break and cut lots and switched bits round."" Gulati says the story focuses on a British Asian woman and is ""quite autobiographical — it's my first novel, what do you expect?"" Her friends have been positive. ""I've shown a few people some chapters and they're desperate to know what happens next."" Just like The Street, then. ■ William Fiennes, author of the bestselling travel book The Snow Geese, will relate this week how he went through a ""life-changing experience"" while travelling in Honduras with Oxfam. While there Fiennes picked organic coffee and blackberries and helped to make soap and wine and shared dirt-floored rooms with ducks and pigs. He also went to a remote community where the kids can't go to school in the winter because they risk getting washed away by a river. In a lighter moment he danced to Ace of Base in a village hall that is HQ for a women's group. To hear more, turn up at St Cross College, St Giles, Oxford, on Wednesday at 7pm. H Lynne Truss is staying faithful to the small publisher that took on her Eats, Shoots and Leaves. She has given her new book on modern manners, out next autumn, to Profile Books again — and also to the same American publisher, Gotham. ■ Dan Brown's super-soaraway bestseller The Da Vinci Code will be filmed next year. According to Variety, Tom Hanks is on the brink of a deal to play the hero. ■ A postscript from Ian Rankin who wrote in Weekend Review a couple of weeks ago about unwelcome guests at his Edinburgh home.

A space of her own
Dava Sobel's tiny blockbuster Longitude turned history writing on its head. Now, she tells Stefanie Marsh, she is getting ready to navigate the heavens
Stars in their eyes: the Abbess (Anna Carteret) tests the device invented by the father of Sister Maria Celeste (Rebecca Hall) In Galileo's Daughter, above. Opposite: the writer Dava Sobel
Did Dava Sobel look this accomplished before hitting the big time? Even from a distance, her erect figure suggests predestined success. The high forehead, the face framed by thick short hair left not unflatteringly grey, brings to mind first Mount Rushmore, then a trio of American female high-achievers: Camille Paglia, Susan Sontag and, more incongruously, the sex therapist Dr Ruth Westheimer. Sobel will say that she finds success confusing and that she thinks of herself as ""very odd"", but nothing in her bearing suggests this. Hers is the face, I think as we shake hands, of a woman with both brains and a purpose. In the vernacular of her home town, New York, this is the face of a ball-breaker. Crunch go my knuckles. It is the sad fate of contemporary Americans, no matter how accomplished, that they should feel the need to excuse their nationality to a European. Almost the first thing that pops out of Sobel's mouth when we meet in Bath — where Peter Hall is directing the stage version of her second bestselling book-— is an apology. ""It's a terrible thing to be an .American these days."" Sobel knows all about our wrinkle-nosed ambivalence to her country, having struggled to find a publisher for her first, subsequently genre-redefining and blockbusting, little history book, Longitude. As ten editors in a row told her nine years ago, the Brits ""don't want their history told to them by a foreigner"". No such doubts bogged down the Italians a few years later when they were faced with Sobel's most recent book, about the relationship between Galileo and his daughter. How those British editors must kick themselves, considering how enthusiastically the British public gobbled up the story of John Harrison, the Yorkshire clockmaker who invented tiie first seaworthy dock and so enabled sailors to determine their longitude.
g A handful of academics continued to splutter their protest. One man, named Rex Cowan, systematically picked the book apart in The Oldie, sourly pronounting Sobel's work ""a fairytale."" Her crime was her weakness for the lflfi
colourful, sometimes unverifiable, anecdote. ""History is always a partial record even when you're living ft,"" she says. ""There's that great Italian expression: 'If it isn't true, it's still well told and worth telling.'"" Most enthusiastic among her fans, Sobel claims, are builders, attracted, presumably, by the book's obvious love ofthe well-made. Many of them, she daims without sarcasm, have dedded that she must be a man and, therefore, ""a more reliable authority"". This too she has decided to interpret as a compliment Whatever the gender of its author, Longitude has made ""a frightful amount of money"" for its author. ""Reports of my millionaire status are unfounded,"" she says, although she has never so far added up the cheques. Success has made her happier, she says, and, I could add, more confident too, judging by the dramatic evolution of her wardrobe (gone are
i feel i m mmG THE D1EAM OF 2©0 LlFiTliiiS'».2,AND imtmimmum FIGHT FOI A CAUSE
NOBBY CLARK
the buttoned-up shirt-blazer combinations of her forties). But success has also brought anxiety. Sobel's next job, as she sees it, is not so much to write another book (which she has already done — it's about the planets and will be out next year) but to answer the twin questions: ""Why did this happen to me?"" and ""To what good purpose can I put the fame that I have achieved?"" ""Longitude has been published now in perhaps 30 countries. It's still in hardcover. This never happens. I feel that I am living the dream of 200 lifetimes. I often wonder if I've been given this. I've become famous and I sometimes think that there is something I should be doing with this platform, and I should be fighting for a cause — and perhaps I will."" To understand the ambivalence about success we must first rewind to life before Longitude. Just over a decade ago Sobel was happily married with two children. Then her first husband
plants. Had he never left at all, Sobel would most likely still working as one of The New York Times's many competent sdence writers as well as churning out the odd book on back pain and arthritis. Certainly she would never have taken up dancing lessons and met the Italian tango teacher to whom she is now married. Instead, separation left her free to take up dandng, toy with becoming a telescope operator and spend several months trying to get an artide about John Harrison published Most editors rejected the story as esoteric and boring, but Harvard Magazine eventually relented, using a picture of John Harrison's elaborate prototype clocks on its cover. Were it not for that article, the keen-eyed vision of a small publishing house and that the then divorced Sobel fdt finandally able to risk $30,000 of her own money, Longitude would never have been written. One crucial person did not live to witness
dedded he wanted a divorce. His reason was straightforward enough: ""I don't want to be married any more."" Had he walked out a little earlier, Sobel would be known to a few readers as the little-known author of a guide to the medidnal properties of tropical
Sobel's success: her father, a dodor. An eccentric second-generation Russian Jew, his wilful personality and unorthodox views had much in common with Galileo's, says Sobel. And Harrison, a hard-working and self-made outsider, also shares many of his charaderistics. Sobel grew up with two ""really good, really very odd"" parents in the Bronx, where her partially deaf mother read the encydopaedia for fun and went to night school to learn to navigate the 40ft (12m) family sloop. ""I couldn't have come out of my family unscathed,"" Sobel says cheerfully. ""Yes, I would say I am an odd person."" Some say the same about her older brother, a dentist, who gave new meaning to the word ""anglophile"" when he donated two pints of blood on a trip to London because he wanted to ""contribute something to the country"". Galileo's Daughter, a biographical exploration ofthe sdentists close relationship with his eldest daughter, Suor Marie Celeste, a nun, is based on 124 letters from daughter to father. In researching it, Sobel used the Italian that she had left to rust since university. When asked what she intends to do with her talent in the future, this 56-year-old mother of two answers like the earnest teenager she might have been 40 years ago: ""I'm trying to live my life in a good way and make sure that my parents would be proud of me, even though they're gone."" Fulfilling her promise is not enough, however. Sobd has established herself as a spedalist in the unsung and the negleded, having resurreded Harrison and unearthed Galileo's daughter. Soon it will be the turn of her father, a maverick in his day for his support of abortion when it was still illegal and his passionate belief in euthanasia. ""My father had unusual opinions, and did things in his field in an unorthodox way, so he often drew critidsm. He really believed there was a time to die and that was up to the person. ""Assisted suidde for the dying is something that interests me very much. I would certainly want it for myself if I were ill, so what would be the best way for me to support a cause?"" The idea is embryonic but will take a literary form, she says — maybe a play. Sobel sees herself as an educator, a champion for curious ignoramuses keen to better tiieir knowledge. She hopes that her books have the power to make the world more comprehensible — and more meaningful. Her book on the planets will, she says, help the layman to make sense of the world and his place in it And for non-readers, there is always the Peter Hall production. Sobel has her own cameo, although she is played by an actress and referred to in the programme simply as ""tourist"". Many years ago, when Longitude first came out critics accused Sobel of being a tourist of another kind — an American sdence writer trespassing on territory reserved for British historians. It stung. But then, Sobel has withstood worse and come out vidorious — sleeker, more chic, richer, happier. And one doesn't hear much of Rex Cowan these days.

Brain fodder for gourmets
FOOD BOOKS IAN KELLY
""What, another work on cooking! For the past few years the public have been deluged with writings of this sort. I agree. But it is precisely all these works that give birth to (my) one."" Menon (chef to the courts of Louis XV and XVI) in Le Manuel des Officiers de bouche, 1759 The chef Menon, so famous they named him once, may have thought his Manuel was the last word in food writing. But in this, as in his claim that the French monarchy would be pre-eminent for as long as French cuisine, he was wrong. Poor Menon. After him, the deluge. Two centuries later, two centuries of cookbooks and food theorists, restaurant critics and now even chef-biographers — it's enough to make a bibliophile head for the kitchen. Priscilla Parkhurst Ferguson tackles the issue head on: why care about food, and why care about French food in particular? Accounting for Taste:
The Triumph of French
Cuisine (University of Chicago Press, £1750) has all its academic ingredients in place: 50 pages of appendices, notes and bibliography and a generous dousing of US universityspeak (""the aestheticization that counter the materiality and ephemerality of food""). But don't be fooled. Parkhurst Ferguson has her nose in the right place, and an infectious lust for her subject that makes this trawl through the history and cultural significance of French food — from French Revolution to Babette's Feast via Balzac's suppers and Proust's madeleines — a satisfying meal of varied courses. Accounting for Taste brims over with both anecdote and insight, not to mention cartoons and illustrations, and is particularly good both on the written formalising of French cooking at the beginning of
the 19th century and on France's export of a sort of culinary-pastoral myth of itself. Mann ist, was er ifit — we are what we eat — as the German said to the Frenchman, and French culture is perhaps best understood through the bottom of a saucepan. Ferguson's chapter on Careme, the key figure in the birth of haute cuisine and more vitally in the dawning respectability of food via literature, is finely wrought and judiciously peppered with Careme's own words. Probably it's in the nature of food writing and food writers, but her academic's desire to feed the mind is never at the expense of a humane and palpably stickyfingered love of the act of eating, and she even rounds off her thesis with a mouth watering essay on a film: Babette's Feast I've done a fair bit of thinking about French food, and eating of it too, but neither will be quite the same again: if it's all a matter of taste, I for one feel mine accounted for. Alexis Soyer, chef at the Reform Club and with the British Army in the Crimean War, does not fit comfortably into the heroic ascendancy of French cooking, but this may be why his life story, amusingly dished up over seven courses in Ruth Brandon's lush The People's Chef: Alexis Soyer,
A Life in Seven Courses
(John Wiley and Sons, £16.99; offer £13.59), makes for such an interesting read. Soyer had a social conscience, worked in England, and was Protestant, which leaves Brandon with the twin problems of explaining both his uniqueness and the French and chefly traditions he followed or traduced. She triumphs in both regards, even if TTie People's Chef reads like an unusual hybrid of cookbook and Boy's Own adventure. No criticism there: such was Soyer's life. Soyer cooked at the opulent Reform Club, published bestselling cook-
II w j±sau lutiHiuiiMiTnnmnnTmnniiniiiuniiBiMiiiHiiiiHiiuiiiiiiiii'iii icr? P!
books — aimed cannily at the middle of the market or below — but is perhaps most famous for trying to relieve the Irish potato famine with nutritious cheap soups, and for an unlikely friendship forged in the hospital kitchens of the Crimea with Florence Nightingale. As Careme's biographer, I would have to take issue with the idea of Soyer as the ""first celebrity chef — I back my guy — and also her definition of service a la francaise, but Soyer's impact on British cookJng was indubitably great (we may have him to thank for HP Sauce) and his life is epic in scale. Brandon has a picaresque adventure to narrate, but as with Careme, some unusual primary sources: cookbooks. They can be surprisingly illuminating, and Brandon has structured her book around seven courses, with recipes taken from various Soyer works, that make her authorial voice sing out in the appropriate setting of a kitchen. Some chapters work better than others. The Irish famine story is fascinating; the soup is not.
The book is lavishly garnished with etchings of the period — some Soyer's own, some more decorative than illustrative. A book full of Flashmanesque adventure and recipes that ends unexpectedly in Kensal Green Cemetery. Who said food writing was a limited genre? Gerald Samper, anti-hero of James Hamilton-Paterson's
Cooking with Fernet Branca:
A Novel (Faber & Faber, £10.99; offer £8.79), would adore The People's Chef, the food and the adventures. Whether his Gothic snobbery would lead him to appreciate the social conscience of a midVictorian like Soyer is more open to question. This novel is pickled in disdain, as much as in Fernet Branca, the scrawny last-picked kid of the drinks' cabinet team. There's been a bottle of Black Tower, a friend warns me, doing the rounds of South London dinner parties for a decade now: an unwanted gift of urban-mythic proportions. The Fernet Branca of the title is in this same tradition: an ingredient used to amuse the
cooks and disgust the recipient. Femet Branca may well sue. Gerald lives in Tuscany off his fortune and infamy as a ghost writer to sporting heroes, with back catalogue titles like Life in the Fast Lane; The Absolute Pits. His only near neighbour, Marta, a deadringer for Miriam Margolyes giving her finest impersonation of a middle-European vulgarian, co-narrates the story; a comedy of misunderstanding, Mafiosi and extraordinary food under the Tuscan sun. The neighbours loathe each other so intently that were this a Hollywood rom-com they would soon end up in bed together. This being Tuscany, and the protagonists being an effete English food-obsessive, and, well, Miriam Margolyes, they cook and record the recipes. Cooking with Fernet Branca is food-lit light on useful menus (Mussels in Chocolate anyone? Garlic ice-cream?) but larded with bitter satire and piquant wit, at the expense, often, of its readers and their dreams of Italy. You may want to rethink
your place in the sun after meeting the hideous inhabitants of Le Roccie. There are few characters to warm to: it is Hamilton-Paterson's style that wins hearts. I laughed out loud several times a chapter, which is considered rude in bed, I am told. Hamilton-Paterson's love of Italy, and of food, is heavily masked in a lurid and unkind humour — think of Stealing Beauty reworked by Bo' Selecta!—so don't look here for Under the next Tuscan Sun, look here for an unflattering mirror on every food obsessive and on a British tradition only just catching up with the food literature dominating the American and continental markets. And be warned: this could be you.

The departure of the great chef Alexis Soyer from the Reform Club as depicted by Punch",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0502880463/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=2e7ca01c,"books review Brain fodder for gourmets FOOD BOOKS IAN KELLY What, another work on cooking! For the past few years the public have been deluged with writings of this sort. I agree. But it is precisely all these works that give birth to my one. Menon chef to the courts of Louis XV and XVI in Le Manuel des Officiers de France, 1759 The chef Menon, so famous they named him once, may have thought his Manuel was the last word in food writing. But in this, as in his claim that the French monarchy would be in- eminent for as long as French cuisine, he was wrong. Poor Menon. After him, the deluge. Two centuries later, two centuries of cookbooks and food theorists, restaurant critics and now even chef- biographers its enough to make a bibliophile head for the kitchen. Priscilla Parkhurst Ferguson tackles the issue head on why care about food, and why care about French food in particular? Accounting for Taste The Triumph of French Cuisine University of Chicago Press, 1750 has all its academic ingredients in place 50 pages of appendices, notes and bibliography and a generous dousing of US AT the things that counter the materiality and ephemerality of food. But the be fooled. Parkhurst Ferguson has her nose in the right place, and an infectious lust for her subject that makes this trawl through the history and cultural significance of French food from French Revolution to Babettes Feast via Balzacs suppers and Prousts of a satisfying meal of varied courses. Accounting for Taste brims over with both anecdote and insight, not to mention cartoons and illustrations, and is particularly good both on the written history of French cooking at the beginning of the 19th century and on Frances export of a sort of culinary- pastoral myth of itself. Mann in, was er and we are what we eat as the German said to the Frenchman, and French culture is perhaps best understood through the bottom of a saucepan. Fergusons chapter on Careme, the key figure in the birth of French cuisine and more vitally in the dawning respectability of food via literature, is finely wrought and judiciously peppered with Caremes own words. Probably its in the nature of food writing and food writers, but her academics desire to feed the mind is never at the expense of a humane and palpably in love of the act of eating, and she even rounds off her thesis with a mouth watering essay on a film Babettes Feast Ive done a fair bit of thinking about French food, and eating of it too, but neither will be quite the same again if its all a matter of taste, I for one feel mine accounted for. Alexis Soyer, chef at the Reform Club and with the British Army in the Crimean War, does not fit comfortably into the heroic ascendancy of French cooking, but this may be why his life story, amusingly dished up over seven courses in Ruth Brandons lush The Peoples Chef Alexis Soyer, A Life in Seven Courses John Wiley and Sons, 16. 99 offer 13. 59, makes for such an interesting read. Soyer had a social conscience, worked in England, and was Protestant, which leaves Brandon with the twin the twin problems of explaining both his uniqueness and the French and the traditions he followed or traduced. She triumphs in both regards, even if TTie Peoples Chef reads like an unusual hybrid of cookbook and Boys Own adventure. No criticism there such was Soyers life. Soyer cooked at the opulent Reform Club, published bestselling cook- II w ore lutiHiuiiMiTnnmnnTmnniiniiiuniiBiMiiiHiiiiHiiuiiiiiiiiiiii ii? P! books aimed cannily at the middle of the market or below but is perhaps most famous for trying to relieve the Irish potato famine with nutritious cheap soups, and for an unlikely friendship forged in the hospital kitchens of the Crimea with Florence Nightingale. As Caremes biographer, I would have to take issue with the idea of Soyer as the first celebrity chef I back my guy and also her definition of service a la ise, but Soyers impact on British cookJng was indubitably great we may have him to thank for HP Sauce and his life is epic in scale. Brandon has a picaresque adventure to narrate, but as with Careme, some unusual primary sources cookbooks. They can be surprisingly illuminating, and Brandon has structured her book around seven courses, with recipes taken from various Soyer works, that make her authorial voice sing out in the appropriate setting of a kitchen. Some chapters work better than others. The Irish famine story is fascinating the soup is not. The book is lavishly garnished with etchings of the period some Soyers own, some more decorative than illustrative. A book full of Flashmanesque adventure and recipes that ends unexpectedly in Kensal Green Cemetery. Who said food writing was a limited genre? Gerald Samper, anti-hero of James Hamilton-Patersons Cooking with Fernet Branca A Novel Faber Faber, 10.99 offer 8.79, would adore The Peoples Chef, the food and the adventures. Whether his Gothic snobbery would lead him to appreciate the social conscience of a midVictorian like Soyer is more open to question.

■ After the acoustics fiasco at the British Museum last year — in which each table had to have a loudspeaker placed on it — the Man Booker Prize has finally announced a new venue for this year's prize, which will be presented on October 19. After much investigation - possible venues included Tate Modern, the Science Museum, Banqueting House and the remodelled piazza at the British Library - the organisers have gone for the Art Deco-style Lawrence Hall, part of the Royal Horticultural Halls in Westminster. It is 1,800 sq m and able to cope with 650 guests and a BBC
live broadcast. In fact one of
those BBC betweenprogramme idents was filmed here — the one featuring the manic acrobats twirling about on long bits of red sheet. ■ There are now more than seven million copies of The Da Vinci Code, by Dan Brown, in print, though it was published less than a year ago. Doubleday, its publisher, says that it is the only adult book to have sold so many copies in such a short time. Its closest competitor is Robert James Waller's The Bridges of Madison County, which sold six million copies in two years. Brown is now at work on a sequel. His first book, written with his wife in 1995, was rather different from his bestselling theological thriller: it was called, rather fabulously, 187 Men to Avoid: A Survival Guide For the Romantically Frustrated Woman. ■ A tip for aspiring literary agents.

had signed a million-pound deal with Universal Music you could be forgiven for assuming that somebody was indulging in more speculation on the Magnus market. After all, Cul - lum is a jazz musician, and jazz musicians are more accus - tomed to seeing their names printed on social security cheques than on anything with lots of noughts. Hence Ronnie Scott's old joke: how do you make a million from jazz? Answer start with two million. But this time the deal is genuine. Cullum will receive slightly more than a million in return for four albums, with the first due to be released in the autumn .
Universal is the parent com - pany of Verve, home to the enormously successful Diana Krall, so it does not take a clair - voyant to see where Cullum may be headed. Dickon Stainer, the Universal execu - tive who has had a hand in the rise of classical-lite performers such as Russell Watson and girlie string quartet Bond, in - forms me that Cullum will be taking his band into the studio in the next couple of weeks to lay down some tracks. ""He has a clear idea of what he wants,"" Stainer says. ""We want to keep him true to himself.Other major labels, includ - ing Sony, were also on the trail of Cullum, who last year used his own money to release an acclaimed album, Pointless Nostalgic , mixing Harry Con - nick - style swing with some in - sp i r ed pop-flavoured originals . But why were Universal prepared to pay so much? ""It was desperation,"" Stainer cheerfully explains. ""We'd have done anything to sign
him. We'd have bungee - jumped off a cliff, if necessary. He's the most talented musi - cian we've ever come across."" Viewers who saw Cullum make his TV debut on Michael Parkinson's show on Saturday may ask themselves if the record moguls had suffered a rush of blood. The choice of song, You're Nobody 'Til Some - b o d y Loves You, was, after all, a little tame, and the mid - Atlan - tic vocals had Connick stamped all over them. Why all the fuss? For one thing, though , Cul - l um was shrewdly tapping into the same audience that has ac - quired a taste for Robbie Wil - liams 's bestselling swing band theatrics.

Where Williams's Swing When You're Winning of - fers nothing more than reheat - ed Rat Pack fingersnaps, Cul - lum is sculpting a genuinely original approach that blends past and present. Having gigged in rock bands too, he is as happy reinventing a Radio - head tune as he is delving into Sinatra's greatest hits. ""HE'S THE MOST TALENTED MUSICIAN WE'VE COME ACROSS"" The Connick comparisons are worth pondering too. Cul - lum is a grittier performer. But the first time I saw him play live last summer, I could not help recalling the evening, al - most a decade and a half ago, when Connick — then un - known here — gave an aston - ishingly assured London debut at the Dominion. Jazzniks were slow to re - spond then, partly because commercial success always arouses suspicion , partly be - cause Connick's matinee idol looks filled so many column inches. It took several years be - fore the critical establishment began to take him seriously. (Interestingly enough, Diana Krall was no overnight success with them either. She was, per - haps , too blonde for her own good.) Cullum may face simi - lar resistance at first, but only the most churlish soul would fail to acknowledge that he is a
truly gifted figure, part show - man , part unreconstructed jazzer. Like Connick — who was often portrayed as unbear - a bly cocky — he is aware of how much work he still needs to do. Anyone who has inter - viewed him will have been struck by how openly he talks of his desire to improve his piano technique so that he can express the ideas bubbling in his head. Will he make it in Ameri - ca ? October will offer the first test. That month he has a resi - dency at the Algonquin's Oak Room in New York. In con - trast to Robbie Williams, who is about as cosmopolitan as Shakin' Stevens, he has the po - tential to cross the water. Word is slowly circulating in Manhattan, according to the leading critic Will Friedwald. ""I enjoyed the album,"" he says. ""It was very well pro - duced , with a very good band.
I couldn't quite decide wheth - er he was the British Connick or the male Krall. I like him lots better than Connick (whom I can't stand) but not as much as Krall."" It will be fascinating to see how the young hopeful fares. It is worth bearing in mind that the record industry has never quite got the best out of Connick, one of those restless figures who always seem more alive on the bandstand than in the studio. Nor will it be easy to compete with the impecca - ble Diana Krall. On the other hand, the introverted Canadi - an singer has scored her big - gest commercial successes with glossy, string-laden pro - duction values. Cullum has more than enough personality to achieve stardom without smoothing down the rough edges. Something tells me there will be many more cheques in the post.

DIANA WYNNE JONES feels a mixture of gratitude and resentment about the enormous impact of J. K. Rowl - ing 's Harry Potter books — books which bear a certain re - semblance to her own. ""It is marvellous that a whole lot of adults have now realised that this is good stuff to read.

But although she makes no accusations of plagiarism, she finds it annoying that children, who ""never look at pub - lication dates"" , think she might have copied Rowling. ""I think it is likely that J. K. Rowling read my books as a child and felt this is how chil - dren 's books should be. There are so many strong similarities and she is just the sort of age to have read them the first time round. If she didn't , it is very, very strange."" In recent years, sales of Diana Wynne Jones's children's books, of which she has writ - ten 36 since 1972, have been climbing. This is de - spite the fact that The Merlin Conspiracy, out on April 7, is her first children's book for a decade. But in the wake of Pottermania her earlier books have been astutely repackaged by Col - lins , who recognised the potential of the fact that they share qualities with Rowling. Occasionally the correspondences are star - tling . Dogsbody, for instance, has a character called Sirius who transforms into a dog (Sirius the dogstar is the common inspiration); Charmed Life involves a boy in an unhappy fami - ly who grows up not knowing he is a wizard (al - though he believes his sister has powers). In gen - eral , Jones's are books in which the ordinary world and magical worlds collide, and in which plucky children confront dangers. Yet although there are overlaps in the con - tent , and even, Jones says, ""verbal echoes"",
Rowling and Jones are stylistically very differ - ent . Rowling's books are scrupulously struc - tured , with no detail unintended at the outset Jones's books have an unplanned logic, by which events tumble on, arising out of what has gone before, until everything ties together in the end. She does not always know where the story will go. ""Sometimes you feel you are pro - ceeding in front of an enormous chasm and if you stop you'll fall in."" The unexpectedness of her books may stem from the unexpectedness of her own beginnings as a writer ""You don't have it in you,"" her moth - er said to her dyslexic eight-year-old daughter when the latter announced she would become a writer. Encouragement was not her parents' forte. Jones and her two younger sisters lived a life that combined, she says, neglect with pres - sure to do well at school. It did not involve any - one remembering to feed them regularly or clothe them properly. She came to know she would write fantasy ""because I was not able to believe in most people's version of normal life"". Jones's parents, an Oxford-educated mother and an academic father, ran a residential cultur - al centre for young adults in Essex, to which they devoted all their efforts. Their daughters in - habited a ""shack"" 100 yards away from the main house, where they narrowly avoided incin - erating themselves as they regularly knocked over the paraffin heater, and once almost hanged Jones's sister Isobel, who asked to be suspended by a rope like a pantomime fairy. It is quite common for the parents to be vil -
lains in Jones's books. ""Adults in children's books used to be supposed to do everything right When I started the children's book thing was beset with rules. My writing was an exercise in how to slip sideways through the gaps."" She had few books as a child. Her mother for - bade some on the grounds that they were ""silly"" — and these were always fantasy. Her father, to save trouble at birthdays and Christmas, kept the Swallows and Amazons series in a locked cup - board and would bring out one volume between the girls when presents were required. The girls
classified their bookshelves, and one section was called ""Goddy books"": ""The books we were allowed to read were all those books about chil - dren getting together to Do Good. We never touched them, though I argued with Isobel about The Railway Children, which she loved and I said was a Goddy book"" Jones has three sons and five grandchildren, and lives with her husband John Burrow in Bris - tol , where he taught English at the university She started to write when her sons were at school, keeping work on top of the fridge, and
jotting down ideas when she could. The boys would test her on what they had just said, recog - nising her ""total absence of mind"". But she was inspired by reading to them all the children's books she had not been allowed. Her boys "" im - mediately got restive as soon as they were being preached at I thought, 'let me see what I can do that flouts the rules and interests children but can still get published'."" Once she started to write, the ""dam broke"" and she produced three or four books a year. She had a habit from childhood of ""mytholo - gising the whole county""; she and her sisters would construct imaginary lives around the characters they saw, including the ""six cross - eyed bothers: the eldest had eyes that were just too close together, but they got worse down the line until the youngest was completely cross - eyed "" , and the ""clone girls"" — a family of nine creepily similar sisters. These last inspired the idea, in Charmed Life, of identical girls taking each others' places in parallel universes. Real life finds its way into her stories: a wiz - ard in The Merlin Conspiracy resembles the Welsh preacher grandfather to whose home she was evacuated briefly at the age of five; Chresto - manci , the wizard hero of her Worlds ofChresto manci series, was handsome and dapper like her father. She is strong on bossy elder sisters — based partly on herself and partly on her moth -
er . The Merlin Conspiracy includes two awful lit - tle girls, identical twins, who constantly behave badly in ways that most girls (including her granddaughters) do ""maybe once or twice a month"". A kindly elephant in that book was in - spired by an elephant at London Zoo, under whose legs her first toddling granddaughter ran obliviously before she could be stopped, and which ""did a polka"" to avoid the child. But Jones cannot bear too much reality. ""It seems to me that a lot of very realistic books are like journalism and feeble as a result telling you one thing about the present day."" The essential premise of humanity, she believes, is ""what if?"" : it is the question that makes the ape put a flint on a stick to kill a lion. ""Fantasy matches the way our brains are constructed,"" she says. The ""what ifthat triggered The Merlin Con - s p irac y is: ""What if kings still travelled the coun - try as they did in medieval times, staying at dif - ferent stately homes?"" The protagonists of this novel are a girl who travels with the ""King 's Progress"" and a teenage boy lately transported from a world like ours, though his origins are
mysterious. It is a rich tale of conspiracy and ad - venture , eight years in its conception. ""It is a mi - rage , though, that I did not write anything in that time,"" says Jones, ""I was writing for adults — humorous books that arose out of my Tough Guide to Fantasy Land, a send-up of Tolkien imi - tators . They were published for adults — I nev - er have a sense of whether my audience is adults or children: if I do I get self conscious and muscle-bound and can't write a thing. I write be - cause I have thought of a marvellous story and want to know what happens next"" Another motive to is to ""provide a space where children can relax and walk round their problems and think 'Mum 's a silly fusspot and I don't need to be quite so enslaved by her no - tions '. Everybody ought to think for themselves I feel profoundly for those children who are rushed from ballet to elocution and are never given a spare moment to be themselves. You need to extract yourself from the turmoil of oth - er people's interventions.""

Real life finds its way into her stories a wiz- ard in The Merlin Conspiracy resembles the Welsh preacher to whose home she was evacuated briefly at the age of five Chresto- er, the wizard hero of her Worlds ofChresto manci series, was handsome and dapper like her father. She is strong on bossy elder sisters based partly on herself and partly on her moth- er. The Merlin Conspiracy includes two awful lit- most girls, identical twins, who constantly behave badly in ways that most girls including her granddaughters do maybe once or twice a month. A kindly elephant in that book was in- written by an elephant at London Zoo, under whose legs her first toddling granddaughter ran obliviously before she could be stopped, and which did a polka to avoid the child. But Jones cannot bear too much reality. It seems to me that a lot of very realistic books are like journalism and feeble as a result telling you one thing about the present day. The essential premise of humanity, she believes, is what if? it is the question that makes the ape put a flint on a stick to kill a lion. Fantasy matches the way our brains are constructed, she says. The what if triggered The Merlin Con- s p ide y is What if kings still travelled the world- try as they did in medieval times, staying at the- it stately homes? The protagonists of this novel are a girl who travels with the King s Progress and a teenage boy lately transported from a world like ours, though his origins are mysterious. It is a rich tale of conspiracy and ad- venture, eight years in its conception. It is a mi- rage, though, that I did not write anything in that time, says Jones, I was writing for adults humorous books that arose out of my Tough Guide to Fantasy Land, a send- up of Tolkien Con- fiction. They were published for adults I nev- er have a sense of whether my audience is adults or I do I get self conscious and muscle- bound and cant write a thing. I write be- cause I have thought of a the story and want to know what happens next Another motive to is to provide a space where children can relax and walk round their problems and think Mum s a silly fusspot and I still need to be quite so enslaved by her no- er. Everybody ought to think for themselves I feel profoundly for those children who are rushed from ballet to elocution and are never given a spare moment to be themselves. You need to extract yourself from the turmoil of all- er peoples interventions.
