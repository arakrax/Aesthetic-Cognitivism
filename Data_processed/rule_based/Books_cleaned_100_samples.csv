DAVID ALMOND
Some folk thought I was mad when I quit my teaching job, sold my house and took up residence in a Norfolk commune. I was 30, and had published a handful of short stories in little magazines. The year that followed was idyllic. I helped to revive the commune's ancient overgrown garden, to renovate its ruined mansion. I wrote more stories. I fell in love. But as winter came, the commune started to founder on infighting and disillusionment. I left with my girlfriend and a woodturner and his gentle dog, and we rented a half-ruined Suffolk farmhouse. Months passed. The proceeds from the sale of my house declined. All of us were on the dole. We were very happy. I worked in a little timber-panelled room while hail pattered on the windows and the frosts came and went One day, almost in a dream, I wrote a story called Where Your Wings Were, which left me in tears. It grew out of the death of my sister in my childhood. It seemed so personal, so simple, so innocent. I could do nothing with it. I put it away. As the year turned, a letter arrived. It was from Peter Mortimer, the editor of the small northeastern Iron Press. He wanted to publish a collection of my stories. That evening, we cycled across the icy farm tracks to the pub in St James. We drank to literary celebrity and bestsellerdom, then we wobbled and skidded home again. Next day, I started to consider the contents of the book and didn't even think of finding a place for the story with the wings. It would take two years for the book to appear. By then, my money had gone. The book was called Sleepless Nights, it was 80 pages long, 500 copies were printed, and I was paid £50. But this little book, my first, helped to keep me calm and optimistic in the years that followed. I published more stories in more magazines. I had readers, even a handful of fans. I taught parttime. I wrote a novel, Seances, that was rejected by every UK publisher. One evening I found Where Your Wings Were in an old box file. The years had given it some distance from me. I rewrote it and sent it to Radio 4. It was broadcast The little story, left alone in the dark for so long, was proving to be some kind of seedbed. I rewrote it again, and a cluster of new, unbidden stories called Counting Stars grew out from it and from my childhood. When these were done, a new tale grew, about a boy with a poorly sister and about a creature with wings. When this book, Skellig, was published by Hodder, I was called a new writer. It was as-

The book appeared when I was 21. If it can be called appearing, that is. The location was Toronto, not at that time — to the naked eye — a hotbed of literary activity. They were still telling ""the Toronto joke"", then: first prize a week in Toronto, second prize two weeks in Toronto. If you were a young person who was serious about writing, you were expected to flee the place like a rat in the Dracula shipwreck scene, and that I duly did. But not before I had published this book. By ""published"", I mean that the book in question was sold in bookstores and reviewed in at least one periodical. It was not otherwise published. True to the Zeitgeist, I took a hand in the book-making: most young Canadian poets then

did something ofthe sort, as the few extant publishers were not clamouring for their wares. The book consisted of seven poems — short poems, luckily — for which I had won a university prize. It was printed in a cellar, on a flatbed press owned by a friend and colleague. Along with a fellow poet, I set the type. We had to do each poem separately, as there was a shortage of letter As. We ground out 300 copies of each poem, then folded the pages and stapled them together. The final edition was about 250, due to attrition. The cover was done with a lino-block: I carved the block, then set it into the flatbed. The stapled pages were glued into the cover with rubber cement — a mistake, because the glue dried out, as well as smelling odd. Then — how did I get the nerve? — I actually went around to various bookstores and got them to place the book. Bookstores were different then: small, individually owned, run by kindly gnomes with a tolerance for eccentricity. They must have thought that I was a fool or a lunatic, or — in the Toronto parlance ofthe day — ""different"", but this did not seem to bother them. As the book was small, it sold for 50 cents. I should have kept 249 of the things, as the price has now gone up considerably. The title of this tiny but peculiar effort was Double Persephone; the poems rhymed and scanned, and were about sex and death, with some rebirth tossed in: my optimism was showing early. As I recall, the word chthonic was in them, so it was pretty deep stuff. What do I think of them now? They weren't very good, but at least they were — oh, killing term — promising. I've been cheered up since by reading the juvenilia of other poets whose mature work I admire: Tennyson, for instance, has one that begins, ""Airy, fairy Lilian"". Best advice for young writers? This is a risky business. You're on a tightrope. Below is Niagara Falls. Courage. One step at a time. Don't look down. Margaret Atwood's latest novel is Oryx and Crake (Virago, £7.99; offer, £6.79)

/e books review
would you take your own books with you? We laughed, and said no. My first book was lucky to come out at all, first because it was a collection of short stories. These are doomed in the trade, as all short story writers know, because publishers are constantly telling us so. Short stories ""don't sell; readers don't buy them because readers don't like them"". Actually, readers tend to love short stories. Everywhere I go, and everywhere I read to audiences, audiences tell me they love short stories. You'd never know this from, for example, The Big Read, because if you voted for a book of short stories on this scheme your vote was automatically discounted. No small reads allowed. It's harder to find short stories in bookshops. They go almost immediately on publication straight on to the shelves, whereas novels tend to lie around on tables and in display units for months, so there's hardly any browser purchase on stories. They get less review coverage. Publishers tend to pay much less for marketing them via book reps and sellers. Publishers would soon change their tune about short stories if there was, say, a major money prize, or a short story category on the Whitbread. I sent out my first collection, Free Love and Other Stories, to several publishers in 1994 and kept getting the same kind of letter back. We like these, but they're short stories. Can you write a novel? Eventually Virago took a chance and accepted them. I was ecstatic. I went to their offices in Camden and met my future editor, Ruth Petrie. The next day I heard she'd left and the company was going bankrupt. Oh, no! Then Virago got bought by a conglomerate. My book was sure to get lost in the scrum, I thought. But doughty Lennie Goodings brought it out, a small print run in a quite unusual shape, long and thin. Lennie kindly let me have the cover I wanted, a picture of Louise Brooks from the G. W. Pabst film Diary of a Lost Girl (1929). There were a few reviews. It won a prize. Virago was pleased. They asked: next time, can you write a novel? AH Smith's latest book is The Whole Story and Other Stories (Penguin, £7.99; offer, £6.79)
sumed that it must be my first book. No one had heard ofthe little Iron Press or the little Sleepless Nights. But both books shared a starting point in a room in an ancient Suffolk farm, and both were similarly important to me, in building that unpredictable pursuit called a literary career.

My first published book was a long time coming. I wrote a novel when I was 15 or 16. It was penned longhand on stolen school jotters, and concerned a teenager who, misunderstood in his small-town home, flees to the seedy glamour of London, where he ends up jumping into the Thames and drowning. My follow-up was a themed collection — poems, short stories and a novella — on the loose subject of room/space. The novella was an updating of Lord of the Flies to a comprehensive school, where a poster of Mick Jagger was having a demonic influence on the younger kids,. So far, so bad. When I reached university, I drifted from the novel to the poem. (I say ""novel"", but doubt that these early efforts would have stretched beyond 20 or 30 typed pages.) I was 22 when I started work on a comedy set in a Highland hotel. It was called Summer Rites and featured a one-legged, schizophrenic librarian, a famous American author kidnapped by the paramilitary wing of the Scottish National Party, and a young kid with paranormal powers. I sent this off to various publishers, none of which could see the genius of the piece. It probably didn't help that, although the thing was put together on a typewriter, I had yet to learn to put a space after each punctuation mark and two after a period. (It was single-spaced to boot.) Putting Summer Rites behind me, I started work on a long short story, which eventually became the opening section of The Flood. I was 23 and doing a doctoral thesis on the novels of Muriel Spark. But really I was spending more time on my own writing. Living in Edinburgh, I peered enviously across to Glasgow, where writers such as Alasdair Gray and James Kelman were igniting Scottish fiction. No more Miss Jean Brodies. The Flood was a fairly traditional narrative, a typical Bildungsroman in that it dealt with the town of my youth, none too well disguised. When the novel was finished, I took it in person to a publisher called Polygon. At that time, Polygon had just published Kelman's first collection of short stories, and was about to publish his first novel. Moreover, it was owned by the Edinburgh University Students' Publication Board. Soon, I began hearing rumours that the book would be accepted. The letter arrived at my bedsit, announcing that Polygon would be happy to print up 200 hardbacks and 800 paperbacks. They would pay me £200.
I've never sat down and re-read any of my own books. Why would I? I still remember them pretty much off by heart. I know what happens in them. I'd want to change things. I'd just get annoyed with myself. Maybe when I'm an old old lady in my nineties, if I live that long, I'll look at them again. But I doubt it; I think there'll always be something else, new or old, I'd rather read. Gertrude Stein on her death bed lamented the shortness of life and the too-many-books of it. Why would you ever want to read your own? When the first bound copy comes through the door from the publisher, that's it — finished. I was recently on a Desert Island books panel at the Edinburgh Festival with a couple of other writers; someone in the audience asked,

Among new novels are A. L. Aldanov's Trn DEVIL'S Bninn, translated from the Russian by A. E. Chamnot (Knopf, 7s. 6d. net), and Mr. William MoFee's Pnaramxs OF ADVERsITy (Heinemann, 7s. 6d. net).
""The Devil's Bridge"" is the middle part of a historical trilogy dealing with European policies during the Napoleonic period. The earlier volumne, "" The Ninth Thermidor,"" although it surveyed the European scene from a Russian viewpoint, was principally occupied with events in Fhrance, and this present volume is likewise chiefly concerned with historical occurrences outside Russia. Young Staal is in Petersburg at the beginiing, a witness of the g,ruesome death of Catherine and of the equaly gruesome accession of Paul. But lie soon goes. off to Venice, and arrives in time to see something of the Revolution of 1797, the spirit of which is ironically contrasted with the spirit of 1789. Returning to Petersburg, Staal leaves alnost imnmediately to take part in Suvarov's campaign against the 3French
in the Alps. *The account of the battle of Tovi is brilliantly done, one of the best things in the novel being the description of' Joubert's tactics. The whole thin is impressive in its easy handling of the crowded, intricate scene ; perhaps the historical alusions are a little too fine at times, but, on the -whole, the author bears his considerable learning with marked lightness.
A ship, a South American Republic, an insurrection, a railway to be exploited, a seaboard town with a pension kept by an elderly Englishwoman and a cafe kept by an intriguing native, a ramification of conflicting political and economic interests, a stolid young Scotsman with a certain unsatisfied hunger for romance, and a lovely, hot-blooded Southern girl who throws herself under the protection of his chivalry-these are the ingredients of Mr. William MeFee's "" Pilgrims of Adversity."" The reader, perhaps, can almost guess the use he maakes of them.

""The Devil's Bridge"" is the middle part of a historical trilogy dealing with European policies during the Napoleonic period. The earlier volumne, "" The Ninth Thermidor,"" although it surveyed the European scene from a Russian viewpoint, was principally occupied with events in Fhrance, and this present volume is likewise chiefly concerned with historical occurrences outside Russia. Young Staal is in Petersburg at the beginiing, a witness of the g,ruesome death of Catherine and of the equaly gruesome accession of Paul. But lie soon goes. off to Venice, and arrives in time to see something of the Revolution of 1797, the spirit of which is ironically contrasted with the spirit of 1789. Returning to Petersburg, Staal leaves alnost imnmediately to take part in Suvarov's campaign against the 3French in the Alps. The account of the battle of Tovi is brilliantly done, one of the best things in the novel being the description of' Joubert's tactics. The whole thin is impressive in its easy handling of the crowded, intricate scene ; perhaps the historical alusions are a little too fine at times, but, on the whole, the author bears his considerable learning with marked lightness. A ship, a South American Republic, an insurrection, a railway to be exploited, a seaboard town with a pension kept by an elderly Englishwoman and a cafe kept by an intriguing native, a ramification of conflicting political and economic interests, a stolid young Scotsman with a certain unsatisfied hunger for romance, and a lovely, hot blooded Southern girl who throws herself under the protection of his chivalry these are the ingredients of Mr. William MeFee's "" Pilgrims of Adversity.""

PARISIAN HOLIDAY. By VERA WATSON.

A TIME TO CAST AWAY. By EDWARD S.
HYAMS. Methuen. 8s. 6d.
NOBODY ORDERED WOLVERS. By JEFFREY
DELL. Heinemann. 7s. 6d.
A minor but regrettable conscquence of the- war is that one cannot go to Paris -or rather, that it would not be the same. No doubt it is frivolous to complain, but those occasional long week-ends, if only once or twice a year, were good for selfesteem. At the cost of a few pounds one could feel oneself a citizen of the world, and it was pleasant to buy a shirt or a tie and speak modestly of shopping in Paris. As for the Parisians, encounters with porters, taxi-drivers, waiters, and the proprietor of a favourite small hotel made one an authority on the subject, and it is only in reading such a book as PARISIAN HOLIDAY that the bubble bursts. Of course we did not know the French-but Miss Vera Watson will make the introductions.
The English girl on holiday is not quite new to the Continent. Her home is -in Switzerland, so that she has taken at least the first step towards knowing that there are no such things as foreigners, but only men and women with different histories. *At the Duplessis', however, she enters a French family circle for the first time, and she finds it more amiable than alarming, more admirable than severe, and more raisonnable than reasonable-that is to say, Colonel and Mme. Duplessis and their children can always think of justifications for their absurdities. On the pretext of holding a family council they indulge their fondness for gossip, and a round of tea or port when Madame's sister has been routed, or Yvonne and her husband have fallen out, or tempers have been tried in discussing Marie Antoinette is one of their most characteristic and endearing pleasures. Miss Watson is neither earnest nor pretentious. Her picture is restricted to a single unremarkable family, which is to be liked as well as laughed at, and though Arlette's misdemeanours are not to be excused on the grounds of her being unhappily in love, there is a romantic precedent for them. At any rate, the plot suffices to show off the foibles, principles, and good qualities of some engaging people.
0. HENRY STORIES
We must turn to 0. Henry for the life of a city on the other side of the worldand not New York this time. A new volume of his work is now available, and in these early stories and, sketches, unearthed from the files of the Houston Post of 1896, the proper magic is already active. Civic pride seldom prevents a man-unless, indeed, he is a citizen of Paris-from fancying that life elsewhere is somehow more eventful and stimulating, with less of Monday about it and more of Saturday; and one of 0. Henry's remarkable gifts was the discovery, or the professed discovery, of gold in common places. One can imagine the satisfaction with which citizens of Houston, Texas, at.that time would read in their newspaper, and for a moment almost believe, that adventure
had been on their doorsteps: how a private detective had been bamboozled by a thief ; how a* tipsy gentleman had showered banknotes on the sick-bed of a newspaper boy; how a Houston dandy had turned friar in Italy; and how Colonel Warburton Pollock explained the peculiar luxuriance of M. Paderewsky's hair. When we have read such pieces as "" The Pink Flask,"" which depends solely on the efforts of an abstainer to rid himself of somebody else's whisky bottle, and ""The Mirage ,on the Frio,"" the inspiration of Mr. Saroyan and other modern writers is plain. The humour is kind and the kindness niever sentimental, and there is something 'not positively unpleasant about readinglAmerican literature that is still written in English.
CHANGING AN: ACCOUNTANT
English books written not wholly in English are also to be found, and we must admit with regret that A TaIE TO CAST AWAY has some lapses. This is the more curious when a. description of washerwomen scrubbing "" tough fabrics "" follows. hard on a quotation from Jane Austen, and the more regrettable because it makes for a continual small distraction from Mr. Edward S. Hyams's interesting matter. His theme has unusual possibilities. An accountant with a conventional mind is thrown into the company of people who might have come out of "" Point Counterpoint,"" but come, in fact, from Balham. Attracted by a Frenchwoman more polite than her friends, he allows himself to listen, with some surprise, to conversations in which the cutting, the destructive, and the perverse are most valued and which have a quaint flavour of old-fashioned anarchy. Unfortunately, heiis bored, but the lady is a more effectual'influence. She takes him to a concert and gets him to admit that the music angered him. She teaches him to drive a car and see himself in a new light. She is responsible at last for his embezzlement, not because she is greedy, but because she is curious to see him assert himself. They then flee to France. At its most annoying the book is seldom dull, and the evident struggle between Mr. Hyams's active mind and his solemn, exaggerated expression is most promising.
But for real anarchy there is nothing like the film studios. When we weary of the films themselves we never lose interest in the old ritual necessary to make them. NOBODY ORDERED WOLVES is- the latest celebration of the extravagance, delay, and muddle with which studios every-where are always credited, and anyone who has .paid a visit to them knows that there is at any rate a little truth in the charges.- Mr. Jeffrey Dell's celebration is gay, inventive, and as fresh as the subject will allow. His foreign producer is more of a character than most of his kind in fiction, and the attempt to make use of a pack of wolves that no one remembers ordering provides some fascinating episodes. According to this comedy, the British studios are at least as fantastic as those in Hollywood, and the adventures of Phillip Hardcastle in search of the work for which he is being paid Â£2,000 a vear;
are exceedingly funny.

DETECTIVE FICTION AND
WAR BOOKS
The exhibition to be opened to-morrow in Messrs. J. and E. Bumpus's rooms in Oxford Street is more ambitious than most of a distinguished series of exhibitions and also of more popular appeal. Called "" New Paths in Book-Collecting,"" it brings a rich man's hobby wijhin the reach of every man, and many of the "" new paths,"" if new to collectors, are old favourites among readers.
Thus one section is devoted entirely to detective fiction. There are assembled all the historical landmarks in this field: Poe's tales in ' yellow-back "" form, ""The Moonstone ""; a book of which over half a million copies were sold. Fergus Hume's "" Mystery of a Hansom Cab ""; the Sherlock Holmes volumes in their rare first editions; and the earliest detective book by each of such popular authors as Mr. Austin Freeman, Baroness Orczy, Mr. A. E. WV. klason, Mr. E. C. Bentley, Miss Dorothy Sayers, Father Ronald Knox, and Mr. and Mrs. G. D. H. Cole.
Another section covers first editions of War books. Here are not only novels by Mr. A. P. Herbert, Mr. R. H. Mottrain, and others, and poems by Robert Bridges and Mr. Laurence Binyon, but such autobiographies as Mr. Robert Graves's "" Good-bye to All That "" (a bibliographical rarity) and Mr. Siegtried Sassoon's two volumes of mernoirs. Moreover, proof copies are shown of the text of the peace treaties with Bulgaria and Austria; and the ephemeral War-time literature-broadsides and pamphletsnow very difficult to obtain, is represented.
To illustrate the scope of "" authbT collections,"" which the true collector does not limit to his author's first editions, much interesting material has been assembled. In panicular, the sections devoted to Mr. Kipling and Colonel Lawrence deserve attention. Mr. Kipling's works were "" pirated "" more widely than any other author's in the eighteen-nineties and nineteenhundreds: and a large body of his works lent by the Kipling Society is interestingly supplemented by the private collection of Mr. W. A. Young. Colonel Lawrence's "" Seven Pillars of Wisdom "" is a rare book, seldom seen. Messrs. Bumpus are able to exhibit not only part of the manuscript and proofs of the verv expensive illustrated edition, but also a copy of a practically unknown edition of eight copies printed in double columns in a newspaper office in Oxford in 1920. There is also other valuable Lawrcnce material.
""YELLOW-BACKS""
Morc peculiarly for the bibliomaniac, but of interest to those who in their vouth bought a now obsolete type of railway tiction, is a chronological exhibit of "" ycllow-backs."" These are of value as an illustration of middle nineteenth-century publishing history, but they are also pleasantly reminisceni of a more picturcsque period than to-day. Here in their gaudy boardbindings are the Captain Marryats, the Charles Levers, the Bulwer Lyttons, Trollopcs, and Ouidas; even, in surprising contrast, the Hardys and the Nat Goulds. And in another section are other. more artistic and more durable series -books illustrated in the eighties and nineties by Hugh Thompson, the Brocks, Arthur Rackham, Walter Crane, Bernard Partridge, and Gordon Craig.
Finally m.y be mentioned what to the publisher and book-collector at least will seem the cxhibition's most important contribution{ to the historical study of book production-a very comprehensive survey of bookbinding styles, from the sheepskins and vellums of the seventeenth century, through paper-wrappers and paperboards, down to the gilded and printed cloths of the present age.

Mliss Theodora Benson and Aliss Betty Askwvith carry on their spirited partnership and have produced another young and cheerful novel which has a pleasant note of sincerity. It is all very slight, but very well told; the tale of Philip Hailing who loved and was loved, but unluckily not as lie desired. Lovely Joyce did not want him permanently in her life, where ho wished to remain, and steadfast Georgina hoped for nothing more than to pick up the remains of his squandered affection and make what she could of it. The girls are charming and real, and -the young man is real and charming to them, which is as it should be. The atmosphere of carefree youth and discovery is attractive: ""Does it not seem odd when one has macle a great mental stride that one's intimlates do not automatically assimilate the fact vithout having to have it explained ? They do in truth grasp at once the things one doesn't want them to. HIas one ever had to explain that one is stupidly attracted by that dreadful little dago or that literary oddity ? Everyone feels it as a matter of course in the air. And so it is always irritating and stirprising if, for instance,. one has just discovered Bach and a friend then speaks as if his music bored one still.""
""The Manor House "" is a well-handl6d tale of no special originality, but pleasant because it has a feeling of English country and because it utters a heartfelt protest against the passing of property and all feudal feeling. Iiss Syrett deals lavishly in romance, but she is competent and interesting, and her Ann, the gardener's daughter who becomes a land-worker and in time the capable mistress of the estate on which she was born, is a living and lovable creature.
""A Winter's Passion"" is the longdrawn-out but well-told tale of a young wife's deliberate infatuation for a young .ian wvho ,was almost too beautiful to be true, but who did in time yield to her plotted blandislunents. A few hours ^nded the affair, and.Mrs. Edward Shearbridge, of Mloorcross, Yorkshire, who relates the story of her passion with candour and obvious enjoyment, got a lesson that she did not anticipate which sent her in full confession back to her husband's arms. The touch of tragedy at the end is a surprise to the .reader as well, wrho cannot regret that Caroline's complacency should be shocked.

The girls are charming and real, and the young man is real and charming to them, which is as it should be. The atmosphere of carefree youth and discovery is attractive: ""Does it not seem odd when one has macle a great mental stride that one's intimlates do not automatically assimilate the fact vithout having to have it explained ? They do in truth grasp at once the things one doesn't want them to. HIas one ever had to explain that one is stupidly attracted by that dreadful little dago or that literary oddity ? Everyone feels it as a matter of course in the air. And so it is always irritating and stirprising if, for instance,. one has just discovered Bach and a friend then speaks as if his music bored one still."" ""The Manor House "" is a well handl6d tale of no special originality, but pleasant because it has a feeling of English country and because it utters a heartfelt protest against the passing of property and all feudal feeling. Iiss Syrett deals lavishly in romance, but she is competent and interesting, and her Ann, the gardener's daughter who becomes a land worker and in time the capable mistress of the estate on which she was born, is a living and lovable creature. ""A Winter's Passion"" is the longdrawn out but well told tale of a young wife's deliberate infatuation for a young .ian wvho ,was almost too beautiful to be true, but who did in time yield to her plotted blandislunents. A few hours nded the affair, and.Mrs. Edward Shearbridge, of Mloorcross, Yorkshire, who relates the story of her passion with candour and obvious enjoyment, got a lesson that she did not anticipate which sent her in full confession back to her husband's arms. The touch of tragedy at the end is a surprise to the .reader as well, wrho cannot regret that Caroline's complacency should be shocked. This is a clever book, entirely on the material plane.",0.9920060905976399

MR. CAPEK'S ORDINARY
MAN
AN ORDINARY LIFE. BY KAREL CAPEK.
Translated by M. and R. WEATHERALL. Allen and Unwin. 7s. 6d.
With this volume Karel Capek has completed what is fairly described as an ideological trilogy, of which the earlier two volumes were Hordubal ""-and"" Meteor."" In these he was concerned with the legend of the individual personality as it was created by other people; in this latest story it is the legend as created by oneself which provides the theme. An old man of 70. formerly a country station-master and now living in retirement in Prague, is possessed by the feeling of death and sits down to write his autobiography. The first half of the book, a grave and delicate evocation of scenes from the past, is beautifully done, the glimpses of childhood in particular being rendered with uncommon sensitiveness. The earliest indication that there is a distinction between telling the truth about oneself and wanting to tell the truth about oneself comes with the account of a brief period of study at the university at Prague. The folly, the verses, the not very creditable escapades appear, but the narrator is plainly evasive, though unconsciously so.
He describes his first job as a railway clerk, his life at a station somewhere in the mountains, his courtship and marriage, his sober and well-ordered existence as station-master, his participation in the Czech nationalist movement after the outbreak of war. It is the uneventful record of the most ordinary of men, though Mr. Capek sees to it that there is art enough in the telling. And then comes a sudden break in the story: by the narrator's side appears his familiar, an anxious and sceptical spirit. Is there such a thing as an ordinary life ? Where in the record is there mention of the undisciplined, romantic feeling which the prudent habit of years has not stifled ? Or of the "" man with elbows,"" who used love and sentiment to push his way in the world ? Or of the hypochondriacal emotion perpetually warring with physical appetite ? Or of the strange, tormenting streak of depravity ? The somewhat psycho-analytical manner of the later half impairs the story-teller's art, but is evidence of the cunning of Mr. Capek's imaginative conception.
THE SOUND WAGON. By T. S. STRIBLING.
Gollancz. 8s. 6d.
This novel is a sardonic indictment of politics in the United States, and those 1 who have the patience to read it and dis-
entangle from the long conversations the dirtier and dirtier actions in which the amiable hero is forced to acquiesce in his rise from reform candidate to Senator will be forced to reflect with amazement on the state of affairs that it purports to reveal.
All the leading characters, with the exception of Henry Caridius himself and the inventor, Essary, are completely cynical: in fact, the dry comments of the lawyer Myerberg are, in their irony, among the few diverting features of this Balzacian indictment. Caridius, a likeable, "" biddable,"" and amorous man, finding himself unsuccessful as a lawyer, stands for Congress as an independent reformer. He is elected because his sitting opponent has suddenly died, and a little double-voting is easily organized by the machine, which he thereby enters. The most powerful force in the machine is Littenham, president of a bank and a munitions organization, owner of several newspapers and innumerable political consciences. Another very powerful force is Joe Canarelli, the racketeer, of Megalopolis. Both, in different ways, are ruthless criminals, who normally work together. But Canarelli is crossed by Littenham and vows vengeance. Caridius becomes a pawn in the game, and his secretary, Littenham's daughter, becomes a victim. The details are complicated, the facts horrible, and the moral seems to be that, as Myerberg remarks, the only hope for better government in the United States is that racketeering should get a firm hold of the Federal courts and police. "" When that time comes, racketeering will be just as respectable as banking is to-day . . . and then we will undoubtedly enjoy a new and refreshing recrudescence of 'honour' in American life."" For an Englishman this novel is rather difficult reading, but as a pamphlet it is remarkable.
MEN AND BRETHREN. BY JAMES GOULD
COZZENS. Longmans. 7s. 6d.
Mr. Cozzens's new novel is one perhaps to be primarily commended to the perceptive reader, for whom characterization is more than story. There is indeed plenty of incident, but having continuity only in the growing light thrown upon the central figure of the Reverend Ernest Cudlipp, vicar of St. Ambrose in New York, a middle-aged priest whose certainty of faith is only equalled by the assurance with which he scampers about, feet solid on earth, handling the problemsmostly other people's-which press in upon him from every side. For some reason clergymen at once credible and likeable are in fiction generally men filled with doubt concerning their own profession; Mr. Cozzens, whatever his own personal point of view, performs something of a feat in presenting one who is both despite his steadfastness. Many are the difficulties he is forced to face in the space of a single day and night (or more exactly evening and next day), but from first to last he succeeds in moving to and fro between them all, a complete human being.
MARCHING MINSTREL. BY VIOLET CAMP-
BELL. Murray. 7s. 6d.
Perroguet was a minstrel, half French, half Spanish, who roamed for a living with flute and guitar, sang songs and told stories. He was caught up in the retreat to Coruhia of Sir John Moore's Army and, when it had embarked for home, found himself with a baby girl upon his hands, her mother having followed the army to the last and died of exposure. This book is an account of his career, of that of his foundling and, finally, of her son's. It is in the romantic tradition and at times not without that tradition's besetting garishness. Yet when one compares it with the many romances in similar vein one realizes how greatly Mrs. Campbell's gifts of imagination and characterization excel those of the majority of her rivals. The tale is largely concerned with life in travelling circuses, in which all the three principal characters are engaged, and this is described with skill, humour, and at times grimness. A few of the great make a momentary appearance: Murat entering Madrid, Moore marching to his death, Byron in a postchaise, and long afterwards Garibaldi marching out of Rome after its surrender to the French. They are, however, in the background, as they would be to circus folk.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS185544298/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=e319a0c5,"NEW NOVELS MR.

Arranged by Mr. S. S. Segal, chairman of the Guild of Teachers of Backward Children, the exhibitions are subsidized bv the Nuffield Foundation. The leaguLe intend to h:re them to education authorities and other interested bodies. Teachers who see them will be asked to complcte a questicnnaire, to give their opinion of books en show and to add any others they think useful.
Mr. Scgal considers that ovcr the past five years publishers have become more and more interested in the market for reading books. not cnly fcr normal and backward children but children learning Engiish abroad. e;pezially in the developing countries. For backward children, however. the publisher may have to specialize.
Because publishers are only gradually waking up to the potential markct in backward readers, Mr. Segal has put many books not specifically written for them into the exhibitions. The Times Book of Zoo Animals and others which are well printed and illustrated are included, as they lure the reluctant to read. Even so the:> is a shortage of material for girls and fer all backward ohildren between 11 and lo.
Mr. Scgal looks forward to a much greater expenditure by local education authorities on books for the backward (all book purchases are no more than 1 per cent of their total budget at present. he says): to more courses training tcachers for thcm; and. before long he hopes, to a university chair in special education.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS85418243/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=7deeea5e,"BOOKS FOR BACKWARD READERS Two exhibitions of books for backward readers opened at the London headquarters of the National Book League yesterday.

BE A GENT, LITTLE W'OMAN, BE A GENT -the extraordinary title has the effect intended. Call it long, slangy, nonsensical, comically suggestive; the fact remains that curiosity is aroused. What manner of woman is thus exhorted to be-well, not even a gentleman at full length ? And is one to take it that "" being a gent "" is merely a racier expression for the Tennysonian virtues-? Unlike the headlines in the newspapers, the title is discreet. It gives nothing away. Read the book we must, if curiosity is to be satisfied. Having caught the reader's eye, which is half an author's battle, Miss Eileen Winncroft proceeds to hold it more or less fixedly for the course of the book.
On the whole, it is an original, unconventional, unpretentious little thing, the account of two or three intelligent and. temperamental young people who like to make their own mistakes. There are-times when the stream of chatter that bears along the story grows sluggish and dwindles to a kind of "" gossipese, buit these are infrequent. Generally Forest (the Little Wonian of the title) and Sean. her beautiful, idle husband. are carried wherever her work as a free-lance journalist and.his evasions take them, and the rapid flow of the narrative does indeed suggest the speed with which life can take a man nowhere. In spite of occasional sentimental nonsense, the author talks a good deal of sense lightly and humorously on ,the subject of personal relationships, with which her characters are almost exclusively occupied; and if anyone doubts the charm and futility of Sean he has only to look about -him at his own acquaintances to find some other with charm and no intention of doing any work. The type is not uncommon. But we have not yet looked at this mysterious state known as ""being a gent."" The implication is, it appears, that a "" gent "" will not take advantage of her sex to be a bully and will make every effort to behave as a rational and generous human being.
A SEQUEL TO MOZART
The professional reader must always be fascinated by his armchair travels. He will spend the morning and afternoon with Miss Winncroft in or about Fleet Street, and immediately after dinner Miss Sylvia Warner whisks him off to Spain and the past. AFTER THE DEATH OF DON JUAN begins, as the advertisement says, where Don Giovanni leaves off. The Commander has appeared from the dead, the floor has opened, or so. Leporello says, and Don Juan has made a sudden sulphurous departure. Nothing will now content the Commander's-daughter but to inform Don Juan's father in person; and having married Ottavio and engaged Leporello as his valet, on the flimsy pretext that Leporello was the last person to see the Commander, she sets out for the countrv. There evervone is seriously concerned with this accident to Don Juan. His father is grateful that there will be no more demands for money but laments the lack of an heir, and the peasants long to credit the news, for if the son is dead the father may have money to spare to irrigate their lands. That is the rough outline of the position, and in the book Miss Warner fills this in with a loose mosaic pattern of lesser issues. Revolt, spasmodic liberalism, avarice. fear, stupidity, and, when Don Juan himself makes an appearance, the most ruthless selfishness are pieces in it, and Miss Warner makes the nicest compromise between passion and dry humour in arranging them.
A STUDY OF LOVE
And with ENTANGLENIENT the magic armchair is never still. In his new novel Mr. George Buchanan takes one about London with a group of people whose associations with one another are sufiicient to provide a loose and elastic form. The period is the last 18 months, and the people are somethina like a miniature of society. Though the preoccupation is superficially with politics, the book may be taken as fundamentally a study of love, and of love extended to humanity at large. To illustrate this, the people are of all classes and ages, and each appears at a different stage in the slow attempt of man to put off self. Some, like Lady Zia, seem beyond hope; for others, like her daughter, who is not yet set into the fashionable mould, there is still hope; and some, like Lady Zia's husband, who started in youth with liberal ideals, have gradually lost sight of these in the pursuit of culture or material advancement. Much of the material, it is true, is known to us already, but Mr. Buchanan is very good at going a shade deeper beneath the surface and fishing up an unexpected thought. There are parts, too, where, though one is generally persuaded by his arguments, one is not convinced of the truth of a reading; and yet, in the superb description of the multifarious activities of London at any single moment, which serves for an epitome of the society examined in detail, he is not to be assailed.
How reassuring it is to pass to the clear anxieties of Captain Hornblower, R.N.. in FLYING COLOURS, the latest account of his adventures ! He is imprisoned, at the point where we left him in ""A Ship of the Line,"" in Napoleonic Spain, and Mr. Forester's new novel describes the marvellous hardships and adventures of Hornblower, Lieutenant Bush, whose foot was shot away in the last battle, and Coxswain
Brown on their way to Paris and, after months of hiding, down to the sea again. The new novel differs from its predecessors in being less credible, but Mr. Forester's power to make the details realistic remains. We may not believe that three men, one of them recently maimed, could make their way in safety, on a winter night, down a strange river in full flood, but we are given every encouragement to do so. We may doubt the infinitesimal chance that brought them, in a hostile country, to the one house that would shelter and assist them to escape at a more favourable time; but we must admit that, once there, they behave very naturally, and that, when they have set out once more, their recapture of the prize cutter and the battle they fight in the bay have all the old cxcitement.

THE BOOKS THAT WE BORROW SAY more about our literary tastes than the books that we own. If your bookshelves are anything like mine, they contain several hundred acres of the printed word that will never be read, at least not by me. There are Christmas gifts that we never wanted but cannot throw away, books we feel that we ought to read but cannot face and the obligatory copy of Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time, that will never be opened because life is several aeons too short. But library books are different. People borrow the library books that they actually want, and then actually read them. Unlike the bestseller lists, they are not an index of fashion, of reviews and book clubs, or of the effects of marketing and advertising. Library books are the works of literature that we want to read but not necessarily to own and keep. The Public Lending Rights figures for the most-borrowed books, published this week, offer a strange and revealing snapshot of modern Britain. To judge from the statistics, our love affair with romantic fiction has ended; instead, we have taken up with television chefs, crochet-hooks, French people and cricketers. For 17 years Dame Catherine Cookson, queen of the pot-boiler romance, has reigned
* m
supreme in Britain's public libraries. In 1994, she occupied numbers one to nine in the top ten most borrowed books list, with Barbara Taylor Bradford sneaking into the No 10 spot. Today, Dame Catherine does not figure in the top ten. For the third year running, the most borrowed writer in Britain is the children's author Jacqueline Wilson. J. K. Rowling, by comparison, limps in at No 74. Of the 20 most-borrowed children's titles, 16 are by the staggeringly prolific Ms Wilson. Casting an eye down the most-borrowed titles list, it becomes clear that there is a special category of book that people like to borrow in huge numbers, but do not wish to possess, just in case the neighbours come round. Trinny and Susannah, Kim and Aggie, Paul McKenna and Gillian McKeith all do well in this category. To borrow and read these books is one thing, but to have them in your bookshelves practically screams: I am a badly-dressed, unhygienic, slightly bonkers person worried about my bodily functions. The evergreen Official Theory Test for Car Drivers by the Driving Standards Agency comes in at No 19, one below Dave Pelzer's The Lost Boy. This seems only right, since both are written in the same style: repetitive, glutinous and heart-wrenchingly sad. Cookery provides another window of revelation. In the country as a whole, we prefer Jamie Oliver's recipes, but this disguises wide regional culinary-literary variations. Londoners are gorging on Nigella Lawson, but the Welsh prefer Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. Welsh library habits deserve a study of their own. In dogs, for example, the Welsh look far afield, displaying a particular preference for Yorkshire terriers, despite the national affinity for labradors. Welsh travel reading, however, seems less adventurous. While other parts of the country read about France and Spain, and Londoners dream of Scotland, the favourite Welsh travel book is The Rough Guide to Wales. Books about moving abroad are being borrowed in record numbers, but luckily we don't all want to go to the same place. The occupants of the Orkney Islands read about moving to Tuscany; in Devon they imagine buying somewhere in France; in Northumberland they think about heading for the Australian
Outback. Most library users imagine moving to somewhere warmer, drier and more interesting, but not in Fife, where they still dream of relocating to Canada. Mind you, each region has foibles. By far the most popular pet books nationwide are about tortoises; except in Scotland where, apparently, people much prefer to read about snakes. As for hobbies, while Londoners love to crochet, in the North of England borrowers can't get enough of ""Tea Bag Folded Greetings Cards"", a pastime I have never even heard of before. The library lists also offer a rough guide to national hypochondria. Overall, the most-borrowed health book is Defying Age: How to Think, Act and Stay Young. It may come as no surprise to discover that the most popular medical book in the libraries of Northern Ireland is Stress and Nervous Disorders; in Wales readers mug up on The Vitamins and Minerals Handbook, while Scottish readers like to relax with a well-thumbed library copy of How to Lower High Blood Pressure, preferably while smoking a fag and eating a deep-fried Mars bar. The top film, television and music biography last year was Being Jordan by Katie Price, whereas the top historical biography was Claire Tomalin's superb Samuel Pepys: The Unequalled Self. This may be a profoundly depressing statement about the contrast between great lives of the past and great lives ofthe present; on the other hand, I have a suspicion that Pepys and Jordan would have got on rather well. What we read also reflects what, and how, we like to kill. Our own Jane Shilling's The Fox in the Cupboard is the most popular British book in the hunting, shooting and fishing category, but in Scotland they prefer The Pigeon Shooter by John Batley, and in Wales David Brian Plummer's Ferrets. When the aliens finally land in Britain, they will no doubt head to the local library to mug up on exactly what sort of planet they have come to. There the real Britain will be revealed: a nation of age-defying, fox-hunting, tea-bag card-making, food-loving crochet fanatics most of whom, frankly, would rather be in Tuscany; or, if Welsh, in Wales. www.plr.uk.com",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0502963908/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=012d9c15,"ndpapers Ben Macintyre TWe are a nation of age defying, tea bag card making crochet fans' THE BOOKS THAT WE BORROW SAY more about our literary tastes than the books that we own.

THE REFLORESCENCE OF
PHILIP TRENT
TRENT'S OWN CASE. By E. C. BENTLEY
and H. WARNER ALLEN. Constable. 7s. 6d.
Midway between Sherlock Ho]mes and Peter Wimsey stands only one considerable figure-Philip Trent. Unlike theirs, his laurels bloomed early and faded soon. The Railway Murder, the Ilkley Mystery, the Abinger Case-these were never more than names ; and only diligent research in the Colindale depository of periodicals will reveal the uses to which, in his brief flower, he could put such different objects as a hairpin and a cockatoo. In 1913 he failed miserably to solve the murder of Sigsbee Manderson -so miserably that this became known the world over as "" Trent's Last Case."" Yet we think he would not have grudged the well-deserved success that his ill wind blew to Mr. E. C. Bentley.
Twenty-three vears have not changed Trent much; he still misquotes as freely as ever: more aptly than manv of his imitators. Nor had they weakened his resolution to lay off sleuthing but that almost all the persons involved in the murder of James Randolph were friends-or enemies -of his: this new case is thus peculiarly his "" own."" Most important of all, in 23 years his hand has regained its fabled cunning-metaphorically, that is, and in spite of leaving its fingerprints in suspicious places. The weakness of the present story, particularly in contrast with its brilliant predecessor, is that its complications arise not from the intellectual essentials-from the many possible interpretations of a few early-stated facts-but from the large variety of characters and the space allowed to the exploration of blind alleys. Trent's visits to Dieppe and to a City wine merchant, however, though they might have been curtailed to the advantage of the story, clearly provided the authors with amusement, and he will be a churlish reader who does not share it. (Observe a link between Mr. Warner Allen, author of ""Mr. Clerihew, Wine Merchant,"" and Mr. E. Clerihew Bentley, the poetical innovators. The amusement has a heavy weight to balance-conventionalities like the Missing Will and the Missing Heir, the Sanctimonious Blackmailer, the Obscure Demoralizing Drug; for this reason no less than because the crowd is now denser "" Trent's Own Case "" does not stand out as high above the crowd as "" Trent's Last Case "" once did. But it is in the very first rank.
THE SEA'S A THIEF. By RONALD M.
LOCKLEY. Longmans. 7s. 6d.
Some novels leave with the reader nothing but a thrill, some leave also a picture of other people's lives. Three times in four these lives are urban or leisured or both. So a vivid story in which all the people are South Pembrokeshire fishermen and their womenfolk is welcome. The village of St. Martins appears to be close to Milford Haven, and the lobster fishers go as far afield as the "" village city"" of St. Davids northward (collisions with the Welsh result), or nearly to Tenby southward. And in one chapter Antoine and his friend Smy joined a trawler and fished off Donegal, enduring salt-water boils and other discomforts, and Smy was nearly killed when the bridle of the trawl came adrift.

To SEE OURSELVES. By GuY C. POLLOCK

Taking with him his son Colin, aged six, Robert, seventeenth Baron Riddleton, made off to Canada without a word to anyone except the agent of his encumbered estate of Matching. Seventeen years later, when his wife and her two daughters were on the point of being dismissed to penury from Matching by the heir to the title who claimed that Robert was dead, there turned up a competent young colonial with all the papers required to prove that he was Colin and eighteenth Baron. As he was just the man Matching needed and had the money to restore it everything would have been splendid if he and Robert's daughter Susan had not fallen in love with one another. He observes the decencies by seeking safety in Canada; and the reader-always less ready than Courts to presume deaths-will hear without much surprise that he rejoined the now prosperous Robert and with no surprise that he was not Robert's son.
In this skeleton form the story may repel the fastidious. But the authors make the dry bones live in the hunting people of Matching and the prairie people of Robert's prosperous ranch. They even make us accept Robert. Who has the right to be odd, if not a seventeenth Baron ? Robert carries off his oddness with an air, and that though he ran away from Matching because he was frightened. It was family history that Matching was at feud with the men who owned it. and with that notion in his mind he had some ground for fearing that the house had been at its tricks with little Colin.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS370093743/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=d68745b3,"NEW NOVELS THE REFLORESCENCE OF PHILIP TRENT TRENT'S OWN CASE. By E. C. BENTLEY and H. WARNER ALLEN. Constable. 7s. 6d. Midway between Sherlock Ho mes and Peter Wimsey stands only one considerable figure Philip Trent. Unlike theirs, his laurels bloomed early and faded soon. The Railway Murder, the Ilkley Mystery, the Abinger Case these were never more than names ; and only diligent research in the Colindale depository of periodicals will reveal the uses to which, in his brief flower, he could put such different objects as a hairpin and a cockatoo. In 1913 he failed miserably to solve the murder of Sigsbee Manderson so miserably that this became known the world over as "" Trent's Last Case."" Yet we think he would not have grudged the well deserved success that his ill wind blew to Mr. E. C. Bentley. Twenty three vears have not changed Trent much; he still misquotes as freely as ever: more aptly than manv of his imitators. Nor had they weakened his resolution to lay off sleuthing but that almost all the persons involved in the murder of James Randolph were friends or enemies of his: this new case is thus peculiarly his "" own."" Most important of all, in 23 years his hand has regained its fabled cunning metaphorically, that is, and in spite of leaving its fingerprints in suspicious places. The weakness of the present story, particularly in contrast with its brilliant predecessor, is that its complications arise not from the intellectual essentials from the many possible interpretations of a few early stated facts but from the large variety of characters and the space allowed to the exploration of blind alleys. Trent's visits to Dieppe and to a City wine merchant, however, though they might have been curtailed to the advantage of the story, clearly provided the authors with amusement, and he will be a churlish reader who does not share it. (Observe a link between Mr. Warner Allen, author of ""Mr. Clerihew, Wine Merchant,"" and Mr. E. Clerihew Bentley, the poetical innovators. The amusement has a heavy weight to balance conventionalities like the Missing Will and the Missing Heir, the Sanctimonious Blackmailer, the Obscure Demoralizing Drug; for this reason no less than because the crowd is now denser "" Trent's Own Case "" does not stand out as high above the crowd as "" Trent's Last Case "" once did. But it is in the very first rank. THE SEA'S A THIEF. By RONALD M. LOCKLEY. Longmans. 7s. 6d. Some novels leave with the reader nothing but a thrill, some leave also a picture of other people's lives. Three times in four these lives are urban or leisured or both. So a vivid story in which all the people are South Pembrokeshire fishermen and their womenfolk is welcome. The village of St. Martins appears to be close to Milford Haven, and the lobster fishers go as far afield as the "" village city"" of St. Davids northward (collisions with the Welsh result), or nearly to Tenby southward. And in one chapter Antoine and his friend Smy joined a trawler and fished off Donegal, enduring salt water boils and other discomforts, and Smy was nearly killed when the bridle of the trawl came adrift. South Pembroke lobsters and crabs do not bring much profit, unless to the middleman. His account, reproduced in full, shows 26s. as a week's reward for two men and a boy and girl. And the women gathering laver at 4s. a cwt. do not add much. Yet Antoine loved the sea. Six times in the book he exclaimed: "" How wonderful the sea is ! "" After Smy was drowned. and their hard earned boat lost, he "" finished with the sea "" and turned quarryman.

THE GANGSTER CHILD
The criminal is naturally a conspicuous figure among law-abiding citizens, and on this truism Mr. Joyce Cary bases the tragedy of his erring boy in CHARLEY IS MY DARLING (Michael Joseph, 9s.). Charley must be conspicuous, not only as a London boy evacuated to the country, Charley must be admired; and for a time his lively fancy alone contents his audience. But children, like nations, sooner or later demand actions instead of words, and poor Charley has to substantiate his easy promises of entertainment and excitement. He steals a car to take the "" gang "" to the cinema and snatches a bag for ticket money; and it is not long before the need to keep up his reputation drives him to still worse follies. One cannot commend too highly this patient and penetrating analysis of children's minds, which convinces us of the probability of the most extravagant events and will not tolerate false sentiment.
Miss Aldyth Williams's PASTORAL SYMPHONY (Gollancz, 7s. 6d.) also discovers fresh interest in the countryside. Like "" Rue with a Difference,"" this, too, mainly revolves about the Church, and there is a serious young rector who must learn to lead his parishioners to God at their own pace. But besides the sound of hymns, the gossip in the inn and in cottages, and the babel of a village bazaar there is a graver strain. A youth is encouraged by a vain, silly, and rather pathetic young girl and takes his own way out, and suddenly the village trivialities are silenced by the tragic. Mr. Jean Giono's latest novel, on the other hand, does not quite maintain the standard his other work has set. HARVEST (Heinemann, Ss. 6d.) describes the rebirth of a French mountain village when all the cottages are in ruins and only one man is left. It deals with his loneliness and his love simply and affectingly, it has great sensibility so far as Nature is concerned, and it knows how to profit by the joy most of us feel when something useful is made of what was derelict. But it has also a weakness from which Mr. Giono's ""The Song of the World"" was free: it is apt to seize on just those aspects of primitive living |that the English can seldom take seriouslv.

SHINING AND FREE. By G. B. STERN.
(Heinemann. 7s. 6d.)
In her latest novel Miss G. B. Stern picks up the threads of Rakonitz history in the persons of the Matriarch, Truda, her daughter, and Iris and Maxine, her granddaughters. Neil Wyatt, her greatnephew, also unwillingly joins the Matriarch's glorious "" spree "" in Brighton, whither she has gone, the day before her eighty-eighth birthday, to collect the legacy of a commode: *The adventures of this day, on which the long-suffering Truda has told ~her to leave the house for ever, occupy the entire book. But no resume can give an adequate idea of the book's richness;of humanity and humour, its sudden flights into pity and pathos, and its rnellowness. It is a relief that *Miss Stern does not kill off the Matriarch at the end of the book, as it almost seemed she might. We want to read what happened on her ninetieth and hundredth birthdays. DANsNATION OF MR. ZINKLER. By GRAHAM
SuTroN. (Jonathan Cape. 7s. 6d.)
Pilate K. Zinkler was "" a poor halfbaked sentimentalist,like therestof them: like' the cheap Woolworth Galahads they're always grinding out on their films -his films."" So Kit Grenfell thought. Zinkler thought of Kit that, "" He'd got a sorta childishness, like he'd missed part of his growth: like a kid . . . spoilt but nice."" But what mattered most to both of them was what Jo Carbery thought of either. She thought of Kit that he ""specialized in companionship: which means the use of people when you feel in the mood; and when you don't they're just shelved. Most women aren't satisfied with that.

How they got to Hell, and what they found there, and how they tried to climb out makes a very exciting story. The reader can choose whether to give himself to the thrills, or to think out the philosophy, or to admire the ingenuity of the infernal arrangements. He can hardly fail to be amused, even if only at Mr. Zinkler's language. He can hardly fail to be puzzled. He may think Kit's final punishment unduly severe, though perhaps not more severe than life.

WHAT DO ADOLF HITLER, MARY Whitehouse, Jimmy Greaves and Dick Emery have in common? Probably quite a lot if you do enough research, but the immediate answer is that all of them coexist quite happily up on my bookshelves. Moreover, they share a heritage particularly common on my bookshelves, which is that I have no memory of how they got there. Ooh You Were Awful ...But I Like You — the life story of Dick Emery as told to his — count 'em — sixth wife, Fay Hillier — has a reduced sticker from a shop called The Works on it (£15.99 down to £10, then to a further £4.99) and I do have a very vague memory of once being in The Works looking at remaindered books; but actually taking this one to the till, getting the fiver out of my wallet, and rushing home to read Fay's superbly detailed biog of the great man (if a little cursory, perhaps, on the subject of Dick's other five wives) — that's gone. Similarly, I noticed Jimmy Greaves's The Heart of The Game sitting by itself — as if picked out in a Waterstone's recommendation — on my shelves last week, but — perhaps like Jimmy in his drinking days — have no memory of how exactly it ended up there. The Mary Whitehouse book is a tome entitled Whatever Happened to Sex? I'd assumed it was a cri de coeur about the author's personal life, the answer to which, I have to say, is provided by the photo of Mary on the back — but it is, in fact, a learned argument against the permissive society, which, judging from the state of the cover, I rushed out and bought immediately on its publication in 1977, presumably in between buying a new protractor and Never Mind the Bollocks. But I have no memory of doing so. Hitler is a slightly different kettle offish, as I do remember buying most of my Nazi/ Holocaust books, some of which I've had for a while, others that came during the writing of my last novel, set during the war — but what I don't remember is the moment at which these went beyond the standard legal requirement for a North London Jew and became a full-on Hitler/Holocaust library section. Surely there was a moment when I thought: ""Hold on... is this becoming a bit creepy? Am I going to be contacted any minute by Stormfront's book club?"" But clearly not. It's one of the functions, I think, of being a bit bookish. The fact is, I buy a lot of books, on impulse, I get sent a lot of books, and I hardly ever throw out books — taking the Nazi

The trouble is, as one ages, of course, you can't remember why you ever bought half of them. And worse still, you realise that the assumption behind keeping all these books — that you will get round to reading them al one day — is, with time, looking shaky.

MR. J. B. MORTON
SKYLIGHTIERS. By J. B. MORTON. (Heine-
rnann. 7s. 6d. net.)
In the interests of his story Mr. J. B. Morton has devised a new religion. Skylight is an English religion for the English.
"" Not one blooming rule. That's the whole point of it,"" says Ephraim Clutch, the moving spirit. ' It's rules and rcegulations that have emptied thlc churches. ... We go about thle place lecturing-not preaching, nmark you. Lecturing. We exhort the young to be cheerful and hopeful. Happiness, that's the keynote. We pass round the plate after our meetings. And so on.-
With the ill-gotten money of Sir George Barlow behind it, Skylight was born. The poor, being fundamentally sensible, rejected it. So a fresh start was made at Oxford, and Skylight was well and truly launched into notoriety. After that it was easily foisted on the frivolous rich. Debate in the Press and among the clergy focused the limelight full on Skylight. But it could not last, as Clutch and his friend Buster Honey had alt along known. Shaken by the genuine conversion of Sir George Barlow, and made aware that the game was up by the displacement of Skylight from the splash page of newspapers, Clutch and his comrade decamped with their substantial %vinnings.
Thus the "" religious racket "" scored only a temporal victory. MIr. Morton's narrative is lively with mass meetings, processions, and brawls. It is,'indeed, a most hilarious story; but what chiefly matters in it-to him, no doubt, as well as to usis Mr. Nlorton's attitude. Corruption is everywhere, he seems to be saving. There are the silly people who are exploited and the base people who exploit them; and these two classes make up a terribly large part of the England of "" Skylighters."" Only when life is viewed with a pronounced squint can it appear quite so bad as that.
THE STRANGE INVADERS. By ALUN
LLEWELLYN. (Bell. 7s. 6d. net.)
For his new novel Mr.' Llewellyn has ,gone to -a future period iwhen inan is dying out; and. he has multiplied the causes of his decadence so freely that we cannot ascribe particular effects to any one of them. There is "" The Destruction"" -familiar to our generation as the next war; in it '; the machines for war destroyed the machines for peace."" There is the paralysing creed of the day. This is Stalinism as interpreted by the ruling cliquc which styles itself ""'The Fathers "" from the study of sacred writings which few of them can read. It is Stalinism without factories, for in culture and knowledge of the crafts man has relapsed into the Llewellyndlithic age. Fortunately for the Fathers enough swords have survived from earlier ages to arm their bodyguard; the people are slaves and unarmed. Nor is this all; there has been some convulsion of Nature that has accentuated the difficulties of humanity. Giant saurians attack the defenceless community. In the conflict and the outcome we have a melodramatic theme which suffices for a thriller ; but we fancv that behind it is an allegory in which the evil forces are Communism, which deprives man of mental initiative, and war typified by the soulless and irresistible saurians.
THE DEMON IN THE HOUSE. Stories of
Tony Morland. By ANGELA THIRKELL. (Hamish Hamilton. 7s. 6d. net.)
"" The Demon in the House "" is a Christmas prcsent for mothers. Those who read Mrs. Thirkell's ""High Rising ""will certainlv remember the little boy in it, Tony Morland; she has recognized that in him she had a subject made to her hand, and she now gives us an amplification of the earlier indictment of small-boyhood. Mrs. T'hirkell insists thai she loves as well as hates Tony; and to make this claim credible she, has given most of the brief space between his escapades to the effect 'of them on his mother, Laura-to her anxiety when, for instance, he goes bicycling; to her impulse to resent it when he is being rightly told-off by his outraged elders;'to her fears that he will suffer in "" the Upper School "" in his nonexistent sensitiveiness; and to her gratitude for an occasional hug. But she is chiefly concerned with the escapades and the objects, including himself, that. as the result of them, have to be cleaned or mended. Not but What his demoniacal quality is exhibited at least as much in what he savs as in what he does. We have it in both aspects when he was told lo have a bath and proceeded to do science: -

CRIMINAL PSYCHOLOGY
THE POWER To KILL. BY ROBERT
HICHENS. (Benn. 7s. 6d. net.)
Mr. Hichens here gives us yet another of his subtly constructed tales of criminal psychology. The keynote is struck by the remark of a lawyer at a party in the first chapter, that ""there are a great many more potential murderers among us than active murderers,"" because the former do not realize the power they possess. A young American, Clarence Van Drinen, who is listening, displays a curious interest. Is he, perhaps, one of the "" potential murderers "" ? So far he has only been the victim of an intending murderess, Virginia MacGarron, who in a frenzy of rejected love tried to shoot him before he came to England. Now he is in love with a beautiful but apparently rather frigid Englishwoman, Leila Astlie; but Virginia, who escaped the consequences of her act through his chivalry, is still pursuing him. He marries Leila, but is in the quandary that it is dangerous for him to remain within reach of Virginia's murderous violence, and yet dishonourable to his manhood to seem to run away from her. He compromises by accepting a post at Bale, in Switzerland, and his wife, who had wished him to go with her to the Far East, quickly perceives that this compromise indicates Virginia's power over him; he is a blend of weakness and obstinacy, and his weakness is susceptible to the American woman's impassioned pursuit of him. But Leila now reveals an unsuspected depth of jealous fury. .. and we are still searching for the potential killer who is to turn into an actual one when the shattering climax comes. Mr. Hichens in this clever tale once again shows himself both a born story-teller and a delicate psychologist.
INVASION FROM THE AIR. By FRANIC
McILRAiT and Roy CONNOLLY. (Grayson and Grayson. 7s. 6d. net.)
Destruction of the enemy moral by massed air attack on centres of civilian population is a subject hitherto explored. only in political, military, and technical works. There is a natural disinclination to probe the intimate content of these words, but in this novel, which is a frank and competent piece of anti-war propaganda, the authors have developed in human terms what may happen if the bombing air forces of the great European Powers are not held in check. They give an impressionistic sketch of considerable power of eleven days which elapse between a frontier incident and the armistice to which the crippled nations are driven by the havoc which each wreaks on the other. The Nemesis of a warfare in which the only defence proves to be counter-attack is ruthlessly driven home. The broad effects of Armageddon on masses of men, women and children unarmed, unprotected and untrained in military discipline are worked out in scenes of vivid horror. It may be objected that the characters in this tale are no more than puppets set to dance the consequences of an overstrained premiss. The collapse of the civil power between warring factions of Fascists and Communists in a desolated capital may be overdrawn. None the less, in their imaginative construction of a terrible theme the sharp strokes of this tale are often admirable in their intensity. And as to their applicability to the contemporary scene, he who runs may read.

A PRINCE OF THE CAPTIVITY. By JoHN
BUCHAN. (Hodder and Stoughton. 7s. 6d. net).
Mr. Buchan takes for his subject a world out of joint, and for his protagonist a man who, in the hope of setting it right, makes of himself a propitiatory sacrifice. The man, Adam Melfort, is brought to the reader's notice by just the right people in an opening paragraph which will make all good Buchanites wriggle with delighted anticipation. And a page or two later he is doing two years for forgery ! Of course he is innocent-but the book can never be the same afterwards. No one, of course, would know this better than Mr. Buchan. The explanation is that, though he gives us trials of the body in physical adventures too many to enumerate, his subject is trials of the spirit, and these last must include humiliation as well as failure.
We are to suppose that Adam is rehabilitated-at any rate sufficiently for his purposes-by his achievements as a universal Secret Service agent in the War. In the course of them he learned apparently to defy detection when assuming any disguise or speaking any language that the interests of his country demanded. With these accomplishments he was able after the War to move in all social circles and secret societies in this country and Germany. The use to which he put them was to hear the truth about the problems of the day-many of which are most vigorously summarized-and to search for a leader who would inspire the nation with a soul. On the last page he saves the man who may possibly be such a leader at a cost to himself which is implicit in what has gone before.

It has long been orthodox among young authors to thank God they are not as this Pharisee; one regrets, however, that a translator of Mrs. Muir's capacity should take for her second novel so worn a theme as the unpleasantness of the virtuous, and show in handling it such a very docile adherence to tradition. Mrs. Ritchie, who inhabits aScotspre-War town that follows the good old fashion of green shutters, is the domestic despot whose acrid virtues drive.her husband and family to unpleasant ends. The growth and process and effect of these virtues, expounded with an inveterate thoroughness, are the whole substance of the book; and the conventional realism of its lingering detail, expressed throughout in an earnest monotone, comes in the end to the reader's nerves.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS336144615/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=d2168ab6,"NEW NOVELS A PRINCE OF THE CAPTIVITY.

A VICTORIAN ROMANCE
THE FROZEN HEART. By MRS. ST. LOE
STRACHEY. (Dent. 7s. 6d.)
This, Mrs. St. Loe Strachey's first novel, might be called a domestic historical romance. Her heroine Margaret Russell is in the schoolroom at Queen Victoria's accession and we leave her as -a happy married woman, after many trials, in 1870. Mrs. Strachey has drawn largely ;on contemporary memoirs for the atmosphere and surroundings of her characters; the Corn Laws are discussed with the dilettantism of the drawing-room, the railway is gradually accepted, we see a London season in the forties, Mario and Grisi, the still powerful Almacks Committee, the riding parties in the Row. Then the scene shifts to Paris in 1848, where Margaret is carried away by a romantic feeling for Lamartine.
The affair does not go beyond sentiment, but poor Margaret's happiness is ruined for years by what her brother quite truly calls Lamartine's exploiting of her generous nature. Even riches and marriage with a faithful and high-minded admirer do not thaw her frozen heart. She hears of Lamartine in distress and is able, through her husband's tact, to send money to him unknown. At last the news of the Commune, the burning of Paris, suddenly break down her pride. Her childhood is charmingly drawn and her worldly mother and her Foreign Office brother, bent on consolidating his position and distrusting all poets, are convincing characters.
As I LAY DYING. BY WILLIAM FAULKNER.
(Chatto and Windus. 7s. 6d.)
In ""As I Lay Dying"" Mr. Faulkner tells how a "" poor white "" farmer fulfils his wife's wish that her body should be buried in her native town, many miles away. Annie Bundren dies, her son Cash has made her coffin, and the wagon is to start with the whole family for Jefferson as soon as it returns from carrying one more load. Anse Bundren is an unlucky man, and a helpless one, too, but selfish, obstinate, and a wonderful borrower. His luck is against him from the beginning of this trip, for the rains come on, the wagon is late back, and the only bridge over the river has been washed away in the interval. They attempt the ford and get the wagon across, but the mules are lost and Cash's broken leg is broken again.
But with another team the wretched pilgrimage creaks on-Cash with his leg fixed in cement laid on without grease, yet hardly complaining as gangrene sets in; Darl, his brother, gradually turning crazy, and the sister, Dewy Dell, turning over and over in her mind the fact that she is pregnant. Darl sets a barn on fire, so as to burn the coffin and give immediate rest to his mother's bones, but Jewel, after helping to save the animals, snatches the coffin from the flames and stumbles, burning himself, into the open. And the wretched cortege goes on to the end, each character telling a piece of its history and the thoughts with which he or she follows it. The whole is a piece of tapestry composed with enormous skill; but whether the spectacle of human misery and folly is as exclusively important as the author seems to believe is somewhat doubtful.
SUSIE'S"" CAIREER. BY ROBERT HICHENS.
(Cassell. 8s. 6d.)
Mr. Robert Hichens never ceases to be a skilful dramatist, and the outstanding feature of "" Susie's "" Career is that it was a vivid and dramatic affair in the picturesque setting of an opera singer's life in Cairo, Paris, and Marseilles. There is a philosophic question raised too: the conffict between an artisfs career and the claims of personal affection and passion. But perhaps Suzanne Blythe, the American girl with the crystalline voicc but cold and unawakened nature, held in strict tutelage by a domineering mother, is too immature or too temperamentally frigid to offer a fair field for the battle to be fought out. She is tempted by the mysterious Mme. Pangalos, who is staying in the same hotel near the Sphinx and the Pyramids, to engage in an adventure with the young Viennese Baron Cora, who is a vital but shallow and cruel egotist; and part of the adventure, which has a symbolic value and is thrillingly described, is a perilous ascent of the Great Pyramid in the dark. This means a compromised reputation and ultimately a breach with her possessive mother. The trials that follow have a deepening effect on Susie the artist; their consequences for her life must be left for the author's own adroit development.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS102051131/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=5b3e51c4,"NEW NOVELS A VICTORIAN ROMANCE THE FROZEN HEART.

""TTHE JUDGE.""
T= JUDGE. By REBECCA WEST.
(Hutchinson.. 7s. 6d. . net.)
Miss Rebecca West has spoiled a brilliant story and a brilliant study of character with the overlaying mutter of morbid and gloomy theories. ""The Judge"" has two parts, whereof the first is not alone pleasant, -but artistic also the second not merely disagreeable, but heavy. The little Edinburgh "" flapper "" of the opening, with her ardent feminism and democratic ideals, at once an intellectual and the simplest of children, is charmingly and wittily presented. We have come to love Ellen Melville and her romantic lover by the time she turns her back on Edinburgh, her mother dead, and goes to visit his mother in Essex.
It is then that the theories begin to push in. Richard Yaverland, her betrothed, is an illegitimate child. His niother was seduced by the squire and pelted and mobbed in the village street in ""the good old way "" before he was born. The main theory appears to be, judging from the title-page, that every mother is a judge who sentences the children for the sins of the father. That, to begin with, is, we believe, false. But, such as it is, the theory does not seem to be carried out logically. Marion Yaverland has been sinned against by the fathers of both her sons. Her predominant sentiment, however, appears to be jealousy of the girl who has won the heart of the best-beloved. Passions rise in this strange and repellent family. till at the last the mother commits suicide, her miserable life rendered unbearable by the prospect of losing Richard to another woman, and Richard quietly plants the bread-knife in his worthless brother's heart.
This sounds ridiculous. In Mliss West's very capable hands it is far from ridiculous. It is powerful but it is also illogical, disconnected. There is none of the inevitability which the Russians would have put into a.tragedy of the sort.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS269030103/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=17320280,"NEW NOVELS.

WAYS OF ESCAPE
No apology need now be given for what are called, ' rather slightingly, "" escape ' stories, and it is only a question what sort of ""escape"" is likely to be most effective. There are the more obvious sort, represented here very efficiently by Mr. Francis Brett Young's twenty-sixth novel, and the less obvious, the escape into the past, of which TixmE'S HARVEST, by Dorothy Charques (Hamish lHamilton, 9s.), is a very good example. That Mrs. Charques's output is small is not surprising. Her craftsmanship is admirable, and she manages to write with care withotit killing the apparent spontaneity bf her story. This time it is of Englisi cotintry life a htindred years ago, with a military interlude in Afglianistan, and particularly of Jos Htill, the brewer's unwvanted son, and his love for a farmers daughter. What is embarrassing in some bucolic pieces is absent here. These are sturdy and irregular figures, neither idealized nor niade conventionally earthy, and the Reform agitations and a host of country events and political occasions test their responses to otlier things besides lovemaking. In short, it is a book with character, dignity, and ilhe sense of humour implied in aI SenIse of proportion.
Mr. Youngls MR. LuCrON's FREEDOM (H-leinemann. 9s. 6d.) hias its own merits. Mr. Lucton is a business man wlho comes to see, like Mfr. Maugham's breadwinner, that his family has no other use for him, and he, too, takes to his heels. Mis flight takes him into an English countryside that is partly Mr. Priestley's and partly Jefiery Farnol's, and in this he discovers for himself the delights of working and wandering in the open air and finds adventures everywhere. This is much more wxhat is meant by the novel of "" escape,"" and, to be honest, it is possible to see the objection to it. To eseape so purposefully, wvith so Imlucl artifice, is hardly to escape at all. Yet this school of writers has a great store of plots, a qutick eye for the effectively, and perhaps truly, rural, and a charming philosophy of reasstirance and consolation.

THE WAR; HISTORICAL
FICTION.
Among this week's novels are TEN YEARs AGO, by R. H. M;ottram (Chatto and Windus, 5s. net) ; THE PAsHwAY, by Henry Williamson (Capo, 7s. 6d. net); UNDEBxEATIH, by C. E. Lawrence (Mlurray, 7s. 6d. net); and DEFEAT, by Ricarda Huch, translated by Mrs. Alison Phillips (Knopf, 10s. 6d. net).
On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the Armistice Mr. R. H. Mottram has collected in "" Ten Years Ago "" a series of stories or sketches dealing with the War. Some of them are topical articles, such as one called ""Never Again ! "" evidently: written for the unveiling of the Menin Gate memorial, and the majority have already appeared in newspapers or reviews; but almost all bear reproduction very well. The best, "" The Common Secretary "" and "" The Flemish Border,"" treating of that part of the battle zone which their author has made peculiarly his own, are very good indeed. The Flemish peasant, his surroundings, and the Austro-Spanish traditions of his countryside seem to have entered into Mr. Mottrarn's blood, and he paints them all with as much skill in a hasty sketch as in a full-length canvas. The quality of those more directly connected with the machinery of warfare varies. ""The Chink,"" a study of Chinese labourers at the front, is excellent. "" The Devil's Own,"" a fantastic story of a terrible phantom ambulance car, which runs amok and slays men upon the roads, seems on the other hand to miss fire. It is the sort of thing that some other writers of no greater general accomplishment could make blood-curdling, but it does not belong to what seems to be Mr. Mottram's true vein-the pi esentation of things seen and of their effect upon the wTiter's mind. Perhaps the most vivid of all is "" One Day in Every Year,"" a record of the thoughts and remembrances that came to him duting the Two Minutes' Silence of 1927.
Mr. Henry Williamson, whose "" Tarka the Otter "" was recently awarded the Hawthornden Prize, has written a remarkable novel, of which the hero appears to be intended to be a reincarnation of Shelley in post-War Devon. We first meet him when he settles himself upon a family of three generations living impoverished and servantless in an old manor-house, and the story ends with his death by drowning. Between these two incidents there is no plot in the conventional sense, but simply a record of William Maddison's opinions and of his relations with three girls. That is not to say that there is any lack of liveliness in the narrative, while those who know this author's other work will be delighted by his descriptions of wild life and North Devon scenery. Nor is Maddison's idealisni and fierce rebellion against cruelty in any form ever less than inter. esting. Mr. Williamson appears generally in sympathy wit.h his philosophy-which might be called Christian C6mmunism. Hev will be regarded according to the reader's temperament and convictions ; to some, doubtless, he will appear a Christlike figure, to others nmerely a pathetically beautiful soul flawed by weaknesses and even absurdities. Yet the second class, even if it is the larger, will agree with the first that Mr. Williamson's conception is original and that he has lived up to its standard in his execution. Think what we will of MIaddison, we are not like to forget him in a hurry.
MIr. C. E. Lawrence's "" Underneath "" is to all intents a moral tract, and it has the particular defeet of tracts-namely, that in its desire to describe a particular process of moral regeneration it is both arbitrary and improbable as fiction.

THE WAR; HISTORICAL FICTION. Among this week's novels are TEN YEARs AGO, by R. H. M;ottram (Chatto and Windus, 5s. net) ; THE PAsHwAY, by Henry Williamson (Capo, 7s. 6d. net); UNDEBxEATIH, by C. E. Lawrence (Mlurray, 7s. 6d. net); and DEFEAT, by Ricarda Huch, translated by Mrs. Alison Phillips (Knopf, 10s. 6d. net). On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the Armistice Mr. R. H. Mottram has collected in "" Ten Years Ago "" a series of stories or sketches dealing with the War. Some of them are topical articles, such as one called ""Never Again ! "" evidently: written for the unveiling of the Menin Gate memorial, and the majority have already appeared in newspapers or reviews; but almost all bear reproduction very well. The best, "" The Common Secretary "" and "" The Flemish Border,"" treating of that part of the battle zone which their author has made peculiarly his own, are very good indeed. The Flemish peasant, his surroundings, and the Austro Spanish traditions of his countryside seem to have entered into Mr. Mottrarn's blood, and he paints them all with as much skill in a hasty sketch as in a full length canvas. The quality of those more directly connected with the machinery of warfare varies. ""The Chink,"" a study of Chinese labourers at the front, is excellent. "" The Devil's Own,"" a fantastic story of a terrible phantom ambulance car, which runs amok and slays men upon the roads, seems on the other hand to miss fire. It is the sort of thing that some other writers of no greater general accomplishment could make blood curdling, but it does not belong to what seems to be Mr. Mottram's true vein the pi esentation of things seen and of their effect upon the wTiter's mind. Perhaps the most vivid of all is "" One Day in Every Year,"" a record of the thoughts and remembrances that came to him duting the Two Minutes' Silence of 1927. Mr. Henry Williamson, whose "" Tarka the Otter "" was recently awarded the Hawthornden Prize, has written a remarkable novel, of which the hero appears to be intended to be a reincarnation of Shelley in post War Devon. We first meet him when he settles himself upon a family of three generations living impoverished and servantless in an old manor house, and the story ends with his death by drowning. Between these two incidents there is no plot in the conventional sense, but simply a record of William Maddison's opinions and of his relations with three girls. That is not to say that there is any lack of liveliness in the narrative, while those who know this author's other work will be delighted by his descriptions of wild life and North Devon scenery. Nor is Maddison's idealisni and fierce rebellion against cruelty in any form ever less than inter. esting. Mr. Williamson appears generally in sympathy wit.h his philosophy which might be called Christian C6mmunism. Hev will be regarded according to the reader's temperament and convictions ; to some, doubtless, he will appear a Christlike figure, to others nmerely a pathetically beautiful soul flawed by weaknesses and even absurdities. Yet the second class, even if it is the larger, will agree with the first that Mr. Williamson's conception is original and that he has lived up to its standard in his execution. Think what we will of MIaddison, we are not like to forget him in a hurry. MIr. C. E. Lawrence's "" Underneath "" is to all intents a moral tract, and it has the particular defeet of tracts namely, that in its desire to describe a particular process of moral regeneration it is both arbitrary and improbable as fiction. Gerald Alorreys is young and well to do, but dissatisfied with himself and with life. He needs a hard task to carry out by his own strength alone. He therefore sets himself the foolish task of spending a whole year as an outcast, living only on what he can earn by casual labour, though without any experience in casual labouring.

As Springwatch returns to BBC Two on Monday, Derwent May grabs his butterfly net and deerstalker to go in search of the finest new nature books
M WATSON/ARDEA; DAVID TIPLING/PHOTOLIBRARY * Nature in all its glory, clockwise from far left: amatungula and morning glory; flamingos in flight; robins enjoy a good reputation in print Below: a Great Crested Grebe
IF KATE HUMBLE is once again trying to curb Bill Oddie's bubbling erotic imagination, it must be spring — or at any rate it must be Springwatch on BBC Two. Either way, it is a timely moment to see what new nature books are in the shops. Starting at the garden door, Dominic Couzens has written a sequel to his RSPB book Secret Lives of Garden Birds, this one called Secret Lives of Garden Wildlife (Helm, £14.99/offer £13.49). So this time we do not get birds from the RSPB, but plenty of entertaining tales of other creatures — male spiders strumming tunes on female spiders' webs, foxes going crazy over shoes left in the garden, and hedgehogs regularly tossing a coat of spittle over their spines with their tongue, for a reason no zoologist has ever been able to explain. David Lack, the great ornithologist who was the first expert on robin behaviour, also compiled a little literary anthology called Robin Redbreast. His son, Andrew Lack, has expanded this into a longer book with a shorter title, Redbreast (SMH, £19.95/no discount), and has found some wonderful robins, mainly in poetry. They are mostly seen as good birds. There are several accounts of them covering the babes in the wood with leaves — one with good colour sense using strawberry leaves. Other robins comfort prisoners — or unhappy monks — at their cell windows. Ted Hughes gives his robin a ""flaming shirt"". Emily Bronte puts her finger on a paradox of the robin's song when she calls it ""wildly tender"" (just like her novel?), while Edward
Thomas brings out another paradox when he writes of the robin's ""sad songs of autumn mirth"". A new identification book to birds, by Marc Duquet, is called Birds By Colour (Helm, £12.99/£11.69). Wild flower guides are often arranged by colour, so why not birds? This one sets about the task imaginatively, with categories such as ""Birds with a black throat"" and ""Birds with a black cheek"". The only problem is that one cannot hold birds in the hand like flowers, so one may not even notice these features. Also, birds can look very different colours in different lights. Black crows can even look white when sunlight bounces off them. Nevertheless a good try, with good pictures. Where do all the flowers in our gardens come from? An excellent new book, Flower Hunters by Mary and John Gribbin (Oxford, £16.99/£15.29), tells the story of 11 botanists who travelled far in search of new flowers and trees. Joseph Banks went with Captain Cook on his first voyage round the world, and Botany Bay was named by Cook in honour of all the plants that Banks found there, including mimosas, acacias and eucalyptus. Banks also discovered jasmines and gardenias in Tahiti. Others include Joseph Hooker, who found rhododendrons and

magnolias in the Himalayas, and David Douglas, who after nightmarish adventures in the North American snow sent back the first seeds of the Douglas fir to Europe. The Gribbins also include the great Swede, Linnaeus, who as a boy was already making lists of his toys. He travelled for new plants only as far as Lapland, but his mind travelled around the whole plant creation, setting up a classification that endures to this day. He also made a flower clock, with the opening and closing of the different flowers telling the time — and this book tells us how to do it.

Meanwhile, Lost Land ofthe Dodo by Anthony Cheke and Julian Hume (Poyser, £45/£40.50) focuses on the home of a famous bird that is lost for ever. This is the Mascarene Islands, which consist of Mauritius, Reunion and Rodrigues. It is where, at the end of the 16th century, Europeans found the dodo, that strange, flightless bird, and where before the end of the 17th century it was extinct. Probably the main culprits were the pigs, introduced by the Dutch, that ate its eggs. But many other creatures have vanished from the islands since then, including the giant tortoises that the settlers ate, and this scholarly book gives a full, devastating account of them. There are delightful paintings by Julian Hume of other extinct birds — such as the raven parrot, Commerson's lizard-owl and the pigeon hollandais. This book also gives a moving and instructive account of what is being done to save the wildlife still found on the islands.

The best concise general work for the winelover's bookshelf is the Penguin Book of Wines by Allan Sichel (1965, Penguin Books, 6s.). It distils a lifetime's knowledge, and was written by a man who weighed his words. Apart from prices quoted for wines, little is out of date.
I warmly recommend the following books, chosen from a wide field:
The Wines of Bordeaux, by Edmund Penning-RowseJl (1969. Michael Soseph, 55s.). A scholarly book covering the subject p detail.
T7ze Wines of Burgundy, by H.. W. Yoxall (1968. Michael Joseph, 30s.). Ibess exhaustive than the Bordeaux book, it gives all the information needed by most people.
Champagne, by Patrick Forbes (1967. Gollancz, 70s.).
Mr. Forbes knows the subject from A to Z and writes well.
Portuguese Wine, by Raymond Postgate (1969. J. M. Dent, 25s). A scholarly, short book.
Sherry, by Julian Jcffs (Faber & Faber, new edition due January, 1971, 50s.). The standard work.
The Wines of Italy, by Cyril Ray, eminently readable and -well-informed, now only available in Wines of the World (1967. McGraw Hill, 105s.). This volume also contains
carefully compiled books on European wvines not mentioned above,, and on wines of ot,her countries.
Wines and Spirits- of the World (Editor: Alec Gold. Virtue, 140s.) is another good compendium.
Wine by Hiugh Johnson (1968. Sphere Paperbacks, 1 5s.). A book to consult when you want advice or to browse over when you feel the need for civilized writing urnimpeded by technical terms.
For further, reading see the chapter on that'sabject in the Penguin b6ok.mentioned. Wherc items in Sichel's selection. are out of print. I know no better obtainer of second-hand books than Heywood' Hill, 10, Curzon Street, W.I..

B OBLIVION By Josephine Hart Vintage , £5.99 desire to keep an emotional hold on the living. Laura's husband cannot get her out of his mind even as he approaches orgasm in the bed of another woman months later . Her mother writes a private diary of grief in which she confesses that she fasts and has imagined seances with Laura. She cannot com - p reh e n d that Laura's husband wants to live a normal life, and she bitterly spies on him with his new girlfriend. Later, as the blurb notes, we discover ""the living must be ruthless to survive"". Indeed one character advises: "" Hap - piness is a decision. Make it.
And don't cry."" Hart 's decision to tackle mourning in all its facets is daring: bestselling novels are rarely so bleak. The unconven - tional structure of the book is harder to take. Why would a middle-class widow write her diary in pared-down Haftian style ? Why do the characters talk in staccato sentences? Vintage has just reissued all three novels with stylish cover portraits of veiled and ban - daged women , presumably to indicate the themes of emo - tional injury and double lives. The books are best read with breaks in between, for a trilogy of cold portraits of the chattering classes who lack a sense of humour can hardly be stomached without recourse to Prozac .

Laura's husband cannot get her out of his mind even as he approaches orgasm in the bed of another woman months later . Her mother writes a private diary of grief in which she confesses that she fasts and has imagined seances with Laura. She cannot com p reh e n d that Laura's husband wants to live a normal life, and she bitterly spies on him with his new girlfriend. Later, as the blurb notes, we discover ""the living must be ruthless to survive"". Indeed one character advises: "" Hap piness is a decision. Make it. And don't cry."" Hart 's decision to tackle mourning in all its facets is daring: bestselling novels are rarely so bleak. The unconven tional structure of the book is harder to take. Why would a middle class widow write her diary in pared down Haftian style ? Why do the characters talk in staccato sentences? Vintage has just reissued all three novels with stylish cover portraits of veiled and ban daged women , presumably to indicate the themes of emo tional injury and double lives. The books are best read with breaks in between, for a trilogy of cold portraits of the chattering classes who lack a sense of humour can hardly be stomached without recourse to Prozac .

There are many possible relationships with God. Looking back on her life, old Granny Borck, in Mr. Bergman's novel, talks to Him, blustering and cajoling through the long nights just as she had done with her family and the Borcks in general for the last 50 years. For Granny Borck had had to make her way in the world by craft. Somewhere in the sixties she decided that her father's cottage in a Swedish village was not enough for her and set off for town in a milkeart. It was not the most promising beginning for a career, but Agnes had determination and the cunning of the peasant, and the first person she saw was Jonathan Borck, one of the curious clan who individually might be bakers, merchants, impoverished nobility, petty officials, or failures more or less disguised but who held together and supported one another in their difficulties until the family became the wonder and admiration of the town. She saw him, she admired his grand stone house with the copper roof that brought him almost to bankruptcy, she married him, and she set out to save him from the depredations of the clan.
A CHARACTER FOR AN ACTRESS
The charm of THY ROD AND THY STAFF is that it presents a truthful account of human nature with something of a fairytale decoration. Granny Borck has her children, her grandchildren, her petty triumphs, and sorrows that now begin to fade into the uncertainty of an old woman's recollections. She beat her son Gabriel's seducer but took the child into her house. She was devoted to Gabrieloddly and shamefully devoted to him-and she demolished the shame with humour. She was not with him when he dicd since she believed he preferred his father to herself, and in one grand scene of alternating victory and defeat at the end of the book she learns from her other children, together with much else that had not occurred to her before, that Gabriel supposed she only meant to dominate him. Perhaps the most illuminating thing to be said of this fresh and original novel is that, in a careful adaptation, it would make the perfect play for Miss Edith Evans.
Where the old can afford to look back tolerantly on life, it is too much to expect the young, who are still in the thick of it, to be either patient or humorous. Their impulse is rather to act than to reflect, and even when they are as conceited and cautious as young Denis Byrne at the start of FINE ROMANCE sooner or later they find themselves slipping into movement. Young Byrne's slip is towards marriage with the most beautiful of typists in his mother's office, and, altogether forgetting the caution proper in a man entirely dependent on his mother, he flouts her, leaves home, and goes to live among the curious family of the Latimerf~ somewhere in a distant suburb of London. If the Borcks are clannish the Latimers can only be said to coalesce like tapioca after boiling. Even the lovely Sylvia, who has a Puritan tongue and a heart pledged only to the main chance, enjoys this constant jovial dropping-in of aunts, cousins, and their young men on the household over the greengrocer's, and it is as much fear of being absorbed into the Latimers as failing infatuation for Sylvia that induces Denis at length to make a bid for freedom with his mother. The novel as a whole is an interesting English version of the American ""hard-boiled"" story, and Mr. McGraw deals shrewdly and wittily with class distinctions among people who have only that, or pleasure, or * getting on,"" to talk about.
THE CLERK AND EGERIA
SPREAD No WINGS is also of the suburbs but is less frivolous. The clerk in it has aspirations to poetry and several handicaps in the shape of a wife and two small children. Miss Empson, the cashier at the butcher's, is his Egeria, half guardian angel and half governess, leading him in the right paths of Beauty-the capital is Mr. Nisbet's-by way of the National Gallery and Candide. What is to come of all this culture hastily grafted on to a way of life in which the office and the villa home are supreme'? In Mr. Nisbet's case not very much, unless you count the gradual emergence of the wife, who first was appalled at the nude in painting, to be a Lower Slapton deminiondaine. But the earnestness of the story, when-it is not being mildly and funnily improper, is at least true to life. Half the anonymous lives one dismisses so easily as dull and made to pattern are redeemed by aspiration. Thev are untutored, not insensitive, and in this story of the little clerk to whom nothing important happens but a change of work and a change of loves-to him they are, of course, more important than anything else in the world -Mr. Nisbet keeps to the truth of the matter, the terror of the employer, the fear of convention, and the rare excitcment of conversing for the first time about books and painting, capital letters and all.
Our last is very youthful indeed, but none the less interesting for that, since if Mr. Scott fills his romance with explorers he cannot verv well leave out Eskimo customs, which make better reading. THE SILVER LAND is the east coast of Greenland, to which a little party of amateur explorers venture in search of an undiscovered tribe of which they have got wind. It opens-though the narrator is apologetic-with a Rugby match, and the game is the key to the story. Geoffrey Troy, explorer, Rory Anderson, an unworldly Scottish baronet, Fielding Jones, a scien-
tist, Jeremy. an undergraduate, and.Starlight, an advertising agent-they are all decent fellows, and the drama is dependent rather on Eskimo responses to lack of food and other tribulations of the wilderness than to any divisions among the Europeans. What holds the attention in the book is the constitution of the Eskimo society, a perfect Communisnn with only such drawbacks as the compulsory removal of the old or inefficient when society can do with them no longer, and Eskimo methods of hunting, amusement, and surviving the long winter. For those who have still to find an edifying present for a boy Mr. Scott's unsentimental varn should he a cafe choice.

has returned.to the 18th-century setting of an earlier bestseller, Chatterton. , Mingling fact and fiction to entirely plausible effect, The Lambs of London is set in the mid-1790s, when Charles Lamb, then a few years into what was to be a 30-year career at the East India Company, was recovering from a nervous breakdown.

Among the other characters who people this vividly realised world is the antiquarian bookseller and sometime forger William Ireland.

The author's re-creation of these events is masterly. His feeling for the language of his chosen period is as sharp as one has come to expect.

But then she is asked to participate in a top-secret project aimed at teenage girls. Gradually, she starts to understand the insidious nature of PopCo's marketing strategy, and to realise that she no longer wants to be part of it. While some interesting points are made about the way that children have been inveigled by big business into becoming avid consumers, the novel is more than just a timely anti-capitalist rant. Full of cryptograms, digressions on treasure hunting, the politics of vegetarianism, and code-breaking lore, it offers much more subtle pleasures. The best thing, in fact, is the character of Alice — a self-confessed ""geek"" with a fondness for mathematical theorems, homoeopathy, and stylishly unstylish clothes. Brought up to prefer books to television, and ideas to fashion, she feels like an outsider in a materialist world.

Among new novels are Mr. W. B. Maxwell's HIMsELF AND MR. RAIKES (Hutehinson, 7s. 6d. net) and Mir. Owen Rutter's LUcxY STAR (Hutchinson, 7s. 6d. net).
Mr. Maxwell, in treating of HnmsEr.
AND Mx. RA=Es, has developed one of those problems of personality into which he is occasionally -tempted. The result in this case is not quite so successful as on some earlier occasions. Oswald Raikes is one of those people who begin quite young to examine their own motives and take themselves very seriously in hand. He discovered, at 19, that he was insincere, and, further, that this insincerity had its roots in cowardice, physical and moral. Thenceforward he proceeded to fight these innate tendencies, continually choosing the harder way when alternatives were open to him, chastening his desires, following the road of self-sacrifice, and ineidentsJly becoming richer, more famous, and more respected by tEhe world at large. So far we seem to be on the verge of the usual admirible moral, but the fact is that we are left with the impression that Oswald Raikes has in some way missed the goal he set out to attain. We leave him regretfully deciding to recover from the effects of a severe accident, but are given no particular reason to hope that he will at last find the happiness Jae has so far mised.
Mr. Owen Rutter must have chosen his title, Lucxr STAR, with Mr. Harold Drake, Upper Shrimpton's efficient postmaster, in mind, for nobody else in IJpper Shrimpton except, perhaps, Bryan Grant and Stella Daker, w4o were so much in love that all places were precisely the same to them, thought it lucky to be on this part of the Essex coast on the Sunday evening and on an independent planet wheeling in space on the Monday morning. For Mr. Drake,who had a passionate hero-worship for his namesake 'of the ""Golden' Hind,"" the situation was perfect, for while Drake could, at the best, only explore the seas and continents of earth, it was his unique

Apart from oronicling the delights and adventures of Mr. Drake, Mr. Rutter has taken the opportunity given him by the extraordinary fate of Uppejr Shrirpton-or Shrimpton-in-space as it became-to read a good-humoured thoulgh satirical- lecture on the truth that, although the sky may change, the mind does not. At any rate, most of the characteristics' of UJpper Shrimnpton in Essexc survived in Shrimpton-in-Space; but, although Mr. Butter makes his points with a proper relish, he does not allow satire to eclipSe the irresponsible amusement there is to be found in ""Lucky Star.""",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS136651028/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=4773e6ed,"NEW NOVELS Among new novels are Mr. W.

Among new novels are SEVEN, BOBSwoRTn, by J. D. Beresford (Faber and Faber, 7s. 6d. net); EUROPA'S BEAST, by R. H. Mottram (Clhatto and Windus, 7s. 6d. net); and Our-oF STrP, by Derek W0talker Smnith (Gollanez, 7s. 6d. net).
Mr. J. D. Beresford gives us a sharp satire, but the point is softened a little by his constant sense of fun. Bobsworth was a garden city promoted by an ambitious financier, Sir James Cobbold, and a thrusting newvspaper proprietor, Lord Grout, both determined to reap for themselves t-he fruits of philantluopic notoriety. The name of the site was an initial sturmbling-block; Sir James wanted to call the citv "" Elysium,"" but came to agree -with Lord Grout that ""some of the other papers are sure to get hold of the right name and make a joke of it, say we're getting our Bobsworth or something, you understand ; and if that joke's going to be made, as he says it vwill, Ihis opinion is that we'd better make it ourselves to begin with and get it over."" But a worse trouble was the invasion of the rising city at its top end by a swvarm of "" cranks,"" holding strange faiths, practising strange diets, and wearing strange clothes, or, worse still, no clothes to spealc of at all. Bobsworth had to be purged, if respectability was to make a home there and rents to soar becomingly, so Mr. Fiddler, a journalist of few scruples, was sent to live among the "" top-enders,"" at No. 7, Firstwvay, and inspire the campaign for fireezing them out. There follows a kind of burlesque epic, describing the war of the "" top-enders "" with the "" desirable "" tenants, the evolution of Bobsworth on lines of impeccable squareness (architectural and moral), and finally Mlr. Fiddler's heroic end amid the ruins of his mansion-a new enemy arrived after the War and wanted the land of No. 7 for industrial development. Mr. Beresford keeps up the joke wvith unfailing vivacity, and never lets it for a moment droop or turn to monotony.
MIr. R. H. Mottram's story resuscitates Geoffrey Skene, first known to us from "" The Spanish Farm."" It is not at first obvious what the fantastic title can have to do with so wortlly, so stoical, and so resignedly unsatisfied a man. About Skene's actions as architect to the municipal housing committee of Easthampton there is anything but a bull-like quality and in the end he is practically dismissed for paying too little attention to his work. The real reason, however, was that his attentions to Olive Blythway were too obvious to please her father, the chairman. We come 'to see that Skene's taurine capacities were only metaphorical, relating to Olive alone, and more passive
than active. Olive had been unsatisfac- l torily married: her young airmanhusband-a case of arrested development owving to wounds-had hardly roused her sleeping nature. Skene, fascinated by her exquisite line, senses in her the lVaiting Europa. M1r. Mottram, albeit with considerable deliberation, disposes of the husband as he had previously disposed of a coming baby. Skene carries off his widow Blythiway wvhen he finds her in a Cornish village: her surrender is lS perfect as Europa's in the Veronese picture that supplies the guiding image, lt is a pretty image, but the preparations for its cxhibition are rather laboured.
It is time another Pub]ic School novel was vritten, and the question in heavy black type on the jacket of Mr. D. W. Smith's story, ""Have the post-War Public Schools 'learnt notling and forgotten nothing' ? "" bas a certain pertinence. Mr. Derek Walk-er Smith answvers the question in a direct and an indirect way which flatly contradict each other. - "" Yes,"" argues Mr. Smith directly, "" they have learnt nothing and forgotten nothinga"" for here is my hero, Colin, on page 231, after five years at Ormond, agreeing that the Public School systerm is designed to curb the spirit of the individual, but, up to page 231, Mfr. Smith has been busy showving how a determined and belligerent individualist like Colin can w%iD not only tolerance for himself but popularity. Colin, with his intellectual precosity, may have found many of the rules he was forced to keep irksome and paltry, but he was allowed to run the School Debating Society before he liad any position of authority even in his house, and hiis notion.that "" in the opinion of this House, the 13ritish Empire has outlived its usefulness and should be disintegrated"" -was lost by a imajoifity far sm1aller than he had expected. The truth is that, however, much Mr. Smith may hold up Colin as a rebel "" aoing doNvn scornful against many spears,"" tlho spears were little more than toy lances, whlich do the useful work of pricking immature conceit. In spite of hirmself, in fact,- Mr. Smith has m-nade Colin the hero, not of a hopeless cause and a losing battle, but of a battle that has been already won, and on nearly every page, in the conversations on politics, in the descriptions of discussions with masters, in the comparative neglect of athletics, Ai'.

CHILDREN'S HISTORY BOOKS AMANDA CRAIG
L§m£J$mm*rLjfii4:i%i ■ M t""jV:
Embattled as we are by the unintelligent prescriptions of the national curriculum, we desperately need good history books. Yet while nonfiction is storming ahead with series such as Terry Deary's Horrible Histories, historical fiction has never regained the heights it achieved in the 1960s when books by Geoffrey Trease, Roger Lancelyn Green and Rosemary Sutcliffe made us all history boys and girls. One writer who is helping to fill the gap is Caroline Lawrence, whose Roman Mysteries series deserves its devoted following. The Colossus of Rhodes takes our quartet of multicultural detectives out of the city and across the sea towards Greece, into danger at the hands of a brutal slave-dealer. Though its dialogue lacks subtlety, it compensates with a lively, detailed knowledge of classical history. Eleanor Updale's burglarturned-gentleman, Montmorency, is now middleaged, and anxious for the safety of his friendls nephew, Frank. The rise of both trade
its pases c&mmi A MYSTERIOUS corse, a mmm of SENET AND tmm INFORgvUTION
unionism and the Mafia in Italy, England and America put the young aristocrat at the heart of a conspiracy in Montmorency and the Assassins, and he has to use every scrap of acting ability leamt from our hero to survive. A complex and satisfying thriller, its enjoyable features include advances in Victorian radiology, and the intertwining of real-life people such as Edison and Puccini with a fictional cast. There is even more derring-do with Michael Molloy's Peter Raven Under Fire, a Hornblower for youngsters that will make them experts on Napoleonic naval techniques in the wake of a terrific, rip-roaring adventure about slaves, piracy and the Caribbean. K. M. Grant's Green Jasper, the sequel to her excellent debut, Blood Red Horse, is set in the time of Richard the Lionheart. The crusades feature heavily in Key Stage 3 history, and this swashbuckling , romance about a kidnapped bride and a noble horse loved by both Christian and Muslim is a romping read.
For students of the Victorian era, Dorothy Edwards's A Strong and Willing Girl is also captivating It is based on her aunt's experiences of being in service as a 10-year-old in 1887, and displays an artless authenticity that charms. Of nonfiction books, Paul Dowswell's Introduction to the Second World War, written under the auspices of the Imperial War Museum, is superb. It lays out information in clear, vivid paragraphs, lavishly illustrated by dramatic, period photographs. The Battle of Britain, the defeat of Japan and the role of the Resistance are covered in detail, and the book offers recommendations for film and TV, plus valuable links to the internet Highly recommended. Book House has had the inspired idea of turning the lives of great leaders into graphic novels. Each has four pages of biographical overview, then plunges into Marvel comic-style action accounts of the lives of such figures as Queen Elizabeth I, Alexander, Julius Caesar, Hernan Cortes and Spartacus, with battles and murder looming large. It isn't Art Spiegelman, but an amazing amount of information is packed into this dramatic format, which will persuade reluctant junior historians to keep reading. The most enchanting history book of all, however, is Egyptology. Purporting to be the diaries of Miss Emily Sands, an archaeologist iri 1926, its pages contain a mysterious curse, a game of senet, fabulous foldouts and much information. The burnished gold cover, with its jewelled Horus, enthrals children even before they open it and fall in love with the past — which is what all history books should make us do, but seldom manage.

What first attracts one's attention to Mr. Cosmo Hamilton's novel is his description of it. ""A novel with a plot ""-this is dircct and critical. There is evidently to be no shilly-shallying here, no marking time while the characters lose themselves deeper and deeper in the examination of the poor ""unconscious,"" no disquisition on the political situation divided among half a dozen proxies for the author. On the contrary, things are going to move, and many causes will be shown to have their many effects. It is much more restful for the reader.
THY LAM.P, 0 MEMORY resembles Pinero's plays, in having a "" situation."" To understand this you are to imagine a prologue, in which a young girl of good family has the misfortune to have a baby and the good fortune to have a mother who takes the responsibility of disposing of the child. One can almost see the curtain falling as Dupont, the faithful French maid, whisks the infant off to be brought up in obscurity. Twenty-five years later the characters reassemble. The girl is now Mrs. Mandrey, a pleasant sort of woman who has had to turn her country house into a private hotel; the father is now a peer and something in Whitehall; and the bov plays the violin at the Dome in Montparnasse. The parents have long since put out of their minds the memory of a youthful indiscretion, but the violinist, who has just learnt the truth about | his parentage, is resentful and ready to
listen to the suggestion that he should ask for help. It is less theatrical and more interesting than it sounds. Mrs. Mandrey is not a villainess but an affectionate mother to her other son and a patient wife to a selfish husband. When her husband leaves her for a richer and more admiring woman she is not altogether sorry, and she settles again to the many problems before the proprietor of a genteel boarding house with an interest the reader can easily share. Though the plot is made the important thing, the accessories are unusual and not at all dull, and Mr. Hamilton has made of them all a book to while away several hours vcry agreeably.
A BALKAN INTRIGUE
On the pretext of choosing holiday reading we can be unusually indulgent to a frivolous taste. There is seldom space to spare for such unpretentious entertainmnent as the adventure story, but BALKAN EXPRESS may be recommended without apology. To say that the book would make an entertaining film is not to disparage it. For an hour's amusement with enthusiastic foreign correspondents, international intrigue, rapid journeys, and resourceful. impudence nothing could be better, and Mr. Leonard Ross has written his adventure with a proper brevity. One can see the film advancing as one reads. One sees the talented correspondent tearing himself away from the office in order Ito celebrate his engagement and five [minutes later abandoning the party on a chase after news in the Balkans; one sees l the flight to intercept the train at inns-
bruck, the search along the whole train for the Prince and Princess on the way to restoration, the pursuit across Vienna, and then another aeroplane and another capital. That is the way it goes, and it goes very excitingly. A revolution follows, then evasion of arrest, then the lighthearted resolution of an engagement no longer attractive. All is swift, gay, and so persuasive that one finds oneself preparing to catch a train to the country as though it were another of these fascinating international expresses.
Another novel about revolution on | the Continent is LEARN TO LOVE IFIsr, a romantic and sometimes, in Ithe nature of things, rather unpleasant !tale of a young man who discovers
that his marriage is only one of convenience and that his wife is the Dictator's mistress. It is a book in which I inequalities and changes of mood are fre-
quent. At times Miss Amabel WilliamsEllis treats us to some romantic sentiment on the part of the wife that belongs to another kind of fiction; at others she is making a serious attempt to analyse the state of mind of an idealist whose eyes !have just been opened to the true character
of a man whom he revered and loved. The action, which is swift and not unexciting, takes place in a State not precisely identified, but one in which conditibns are familiar to anyone who reads the foreign news. It is, at any rate, a dependency of the Reich, but its internal politics are its own. Though there are repressive laws for those who disagree with the Government, all the elements of revolution are present, and opportunity is not long in coming. The revolutionaries have. scarcely completed their organization when the lady, who begins to. regret her wasted marriage, removes their most dangerous opponent.
THE HAPPY DEBTOR
To this LoVE IN THE SUN makes a cheerful contrast. It is a novel about happy people, people who sometimes fancy they are in trouble and discover before long that their enemies were only fancied and are in fact good friends. The narrator and the girl he means to marry when he has his divorce find a cabin on a Cornish estuary and set up house. A piece of land and a stretch of shore go with the cabin, and the real story is the development of house and land into a pleasant and much-loved property. The beginnings are small, since the narrator is in hiding from his creditors up in Yorkshire and has only a few pounds and no prospect of more. They buy a few things and are presented with more from an idle yacht-
builder's down the estuary; They saw and hammer, convert jetsam (or flotsam) to useful purposes, adopt a stray kitten, make a garden, build a dinghy into a motorboat, marry, and produce a child called Amelia. And what do they live on all this; time ? The rewards of collecting insects and small creatures for the scientists, and the promise of a book on which the narrator is working. It is a charming story, if a trifle ingenuous. Though we may regard the people as nothing more than the excuse for an account of a fascinating enterprise that will be appreciated by all who have a garden or a country cottage or a boat of their own, or wish for these things, it is almost an advantage in such a book. Since the troubles are not convincing enough to cast a real gloom there is nothing to sDoil an
enviable undertaking.

Among new novels are ROYAL FLUSH: The Story of Minette, by Margaret Irwin (Chatto and Windus. 8s. 6d. net); and THANK HEAVEN F.ASTING, by E. Al. Delafield (Macmillan, 7s. 6d. net).
MIiss Alargaret Irnin's new historical novel is at once a faithful reconstruction
of historical scenes and a delightful story. | It is also one of the rare modern books in wvhich the charm of the House of Stuart is made apparent without being sentimentalized. Good Roundheads of the school of John Richard Green may refuse to admit that the picture of Charles II. is true to life, but even they will acknowledge that it is brilliant and persuasive. The same may be said, if in some cases the portraits are slighter, of all the Royal figures in Miss Irwin's "" Royal Flush."" The heroine is Charles's youngest sister, Henrietta, who was married to Philip of Orleans, younger brother of Louis XIV., and whose beauty, sweetness, capriciousness, and keen political brain are so often talked of in French memoirs of her tiine. The more one has read of her the more one is convinced that this is no mere facile, romantic portrait, but a remarkable recreation, and that Miss Irwin has got as close to the real woman as anyone is ever likely to do. The book is tragic, as must be the stozy of a girl brought up in exile after her father had died by the hand of his own subjects, married to a degenerate whlile in love with his great brother, and dying at the age of twenty-six, not knowing in her last hours wlhetlher or not she had been poisoned at the instance of her husband or one of his minions. Yet it has gaiety, as Minette had.
In THANK HEAVEN FASTING Miss E. M.
Delafield studiously presents to our attention the young society girl who grew up wlhen petticoats were worn and daughters drank hot milk in mamma's bedroom after a ball and were sent to lie down all afternoon before they went out at night. They tvere an obedient. sheeplike, anxious lot, with but one idea-to get married. Mlen were "" quite good "" or "" no use at all,"" and when one of them was any good, mamma and daughter beguiled and coaxed hin and with luck landed him safely at the altar. Miss Delafield takes a small social group to dissect and ponder over, and of course she does it with sparkling competence and sound knowledge. From the skin out she vividly describes every stitch that the welldressed young women of pre-War days (Edwardian days indeed) put on for various social occasions. She is acutely entertaining. She is even better when shc shows us the minds and hearts beneath the drapery and lets us listen to the maiden's prayer for a man, a marriage and perhaps a son. Her limp heroine, Monica, and her limper friends, evoke pity and a writlhing dismay for the hard path that women used to tread. MIiss Delafield has given us an excellent and amusing document, bitterly truthful, whlich shows us vivid pictures of the not far distant past when to be 25 and unmarried (if female) was to be a disgrace to one's parents and a confessed failure. Her book is extremely entertaining, althouglh she never slackens the current of Monica's anxiety until the altar and the last line are reached.

6TRAss RELAioNs. By CyRri ALING-
TON. (Macmillan. 6s. net.)
A young Baronet, who must be carefully dissociated from the usually iniqui. tous members of that Order so often to be met in fiction, is enamoured of a young American, and, in order to induce her mother, Mrs. Branson, to visit him, with her daughter, in the country, invents a mysterious clairvoyant Professor to minister to her desire to communicate with her deceased husband. A married sister who was to have. played hostess fails, and the Baronet, determined not to disappoint his American guests, persuades an unmarried cousin to impersonate the missing sister.
More, solicitous for the susceptibilities of Mrs. Branson, who is an ardent disciple of Pussyfoot, the Baronet insists on hustling an avuncular brewer into the unpremeditated part of a retired Indian civilian, regardless of his relative's unhappy ignorance both of the geography of India and of the habits of the natives of that Finpire. Not content with this, Mr. Alington makes a noble lord, in a quixotic desire to defend his twin brother's disparaged name, assume his clerical identity and burden himself with a teetotalism wholly foreign to his tastes. The company assembles, and even Sir Charles Hawtrey would find it difficult to reach the high level of improvisation required to deceive al the guests all the time. Lady Mary, desperately playing hostess and mother alike, is faced with Mhrs. Branson's inexhaustible curiosity as to the numbers, names, ages, sexes, and. weights at birth of her putative faiiyfacts about which she is so ill-informed that when confronted with some photographs which inconveniently represent children wholly different from those that she has been descrtbing, she is almost compelled to surrender.
The noble lord flounders rather in descnrbing a parish he has never visited and recounting duties he has never performed, but, when pushed, is more circumstantially mendacious than the brewer, who in an agony to find the line of least resistance asserts that he is chldlless. The complications become almost unbearable, the unhappy impostors almost have to lie to themselves and practise deception in their sleep, and as a last straw the Baronet learns of the proximate arrival of the real curate-twin and of the two sons of the brewer whose existence had been denied by the inexperienced maiidacity of their distracted parent.

Some books are written to please. Odd as it may seem, this is a fact of which we need to be reminded. What with being lectured and having our consciences roughly disturbed-for our own good and at a price-and our sense of humour abomninably underrated by anyone who can hit on a farcical notion, it is very easy to forget it. Often the lecturers and the missioners-but not the farce-writersare plausible and accomplished enough to draw one's admiration; but admiration is not the whole of enjoyment. A reader needs besides to laugh and like and never suspect that while he reads he improves himself. Chance this week has brought out several novels of a kind that grows increasingly uncommon. They neither break our hearts nor shamelessly pick our pockets, but they amuse and stimulate. It is a courtesy to the reader that more than justifies the pains their authors took with them. To please, stimulate, and amuse it is not necessary to have an entirely new idea.
We know already the situation of the surprising will on which Miss Barbara Willard's PERSONAL EFFECTS is built up. There is nothing novel in the scene in which the Sansoms sit back comfortably to hear how father has done his duty by them, only to find that father's sense of humour has once more been too strong. Yct of thesz Miss Willard makes something fresh, lively, and engrossing. Even the younger generation of Sansoms is capable on occasion of the lack of humour that sometimes goes with a sense of the importance of family and position; and there could hardly be a better corrective than the discreet amusement of the new heir. Richard Elder was old Sansom's posthumous surprise, and the fact that he works, and enjoys working, and is not unduly impressed with his good fortune doubles his advantage over his new relatives. Apart from noting the effect of the will on the various members of the family, we have also to watch the interesting situation of Miss Kay Sansom, her cousin Stephen, a flirtatious and independable young man, who is capable of much unintentional harm, her cousin Ruth, who is young enough beneath her manner to take him seriously, and young Elder, who is dependable without being dull. As for the writing, it is as urbane as the comedy.
THREE SISTERS
CALL THE TUNE is rather more serious, but it displays much the same kind of ironical humour. Again it is a family, but in this case a family broken by the death ot' the mother, to whom Irene in particular was devoted. Greta has her elderly adored husband, and Lettice, the second sister, a little boy for whom she neglects his father. Each has her own form of idolatry, for which her sisters pity her, and Miss Barbara Goolden's task has been to show the various tests to which these engrossing loves may be put. For all her humour, for instance, Irene is inclined at times to be earnest, especially in the matter of falling in love. There is a bearded and sarcastic revolutionary who attracts her and annoys her relatives, and there is alsoamelancholy,unthinking Civil servant home on leave who hopes for a charming, frustrated, and satisfactorily sentimental friendship. The time is the very recent, with private affairs necessarily ovcrshadowed by international uncertainty, and Miss Goolden manages to give a lively account of divergent opinions and the various responses made to recurrent crises. She is successful above all in allowing her people free play, so that the book ends naturally with Irene decided and her sisters not greatly changed, except for a little more experience.
A delightful book of a very different k-ind is Mr. Adrian Bell's THE SHEPHERD'S FARM, which is full of the countrvman's immense lore and industry. Though the people are interesting enough, the real principals are the fields and farm animals, which are shown us over a period of 40 years. By care and wise planning. the shepherd obtains his farm from his former master, and most of an absorbing story deals with his gradual developments and improvements on it. The girl he marries is of yeoman stock and tired of doing nothing but hunt and dance when she has once had a taste of hard work as deputy for her father, the squire's agent. It is largely her capital that buys the farm, and in the early days she has her fill of work in the dairy and beside her husband in the fields. The chronicle of sowing apd harvest, marketing, and white winters, and country diversions is fuller than a stranger might expect, and few people show Mr. Bell's ability to write about it with knowledge and affection.
AFTER THE WAR
Mr. Millen Brand, who wrote a very good first novel in "" The Outward Room."" now writes of life in a soldiers' home in America. THE HEROES is a short, restrained, and touching study of hope and hopelessness in a small section of the unemployed. The motive is always the distinction between home and the Home, to which these men, all more or less disabled, come reluctantlv only when it is impossible to keep themselves outside. The Home is not in itself unbearable. The men are individuals and as free as men can be when lack of money or work gives them long, empty days. When they car find work in the seasonal rushes of the factories they leave until the work stops,
but most of them come back. Not all the characters are as clear-cut as they might be, but that of the principal figure, a man whose meeting with a factory girl in the town gives him an added incentive to find work and a privatc life again, is drawn simply and effectively.
The community in THE WORLD OWES ME A LIVING is very much narrower, being a group of young men with their appendants who earn their living in a flying circus. They are bold, loud. hard-drinking, arrogantly "" hcarty "" young men with a contempt for very nearly everything that is not among their extremely limited interests. The fact that they are continually in danger of breaking their necks entitles them, in their own view, to consideration as more than usually intelligent and exciting persons. It is not a view with which it is easy to agree, but it at least allows Mr. John. Llewelyn Rhys to depict an isolated and completely unfaniliar way of

THANK YOU, JEEVES. By P. G. WODE-
HOUSE. (Jenkins. 7s. 6d. net.)
One thinks of the world of Mr. Wodehouse as being perfect, and therefore stable-a world in which there is no change nor need for change. It comes, therefore, as a shock to read in the publishers' note to his new book that Jeeves has been translated from his sphere of the short story; it is "" the first long story in which the prince of gentlemen's gentlemen has played the leading r6le."" There is a further and more disintegrating shock in the first chapter; it is headed ""Jeeves gives Notice,"" and for a moment it leads the reader to fear that there is an end to his association with his employer, Mr. Bertram Wooster. But this can hardly be, as it is Mr. Wooster who tells the story. Nor is it. As to that story it must suffice to say that it takes us back to the world already referred to, for action in that world is communicable only in the words of its creator, Mr. Wodehouse. As to the further question whether Jeeves is more Jeevesian in a long story than in a short, the point is, as Mr. Wooster might say, pretty moot. The ending is doubly happy; happy for the lovers, for about the last thing we learn of the leading lady is that "" she remained in Chuffy's arms gurgling like a leaky radiator"", and happy for the reader, for the last thing we learn of Jeeves is that he has re-entered the service of Mr. Wooster.
THE PADRE OF ST. JACOB'S. By STEPHEN
GRAHAM. (Nicholson and Watson. 7s. 6d. net.)
In his latest book Mr. Graham tells the story of the Rev. Mark Whyte, rector of a fashionable chapel, who has made himself notorious by Fleet Street activities and by conducting a substitute for the marriage service for divorced people. Mark is a strange mixture of guile and innocence, and when Gar Lloyd, a reputed ex-millionaire and gaol-bird, is converted by his ministry, the Padre and the whole of his entourage of church ladies and hangers-on believe in Lloyd's tale of the vast fortune he wants to bestow on the Padre. The end of the story is obvious almost from the first chapter, but that does not detract from its interest. Mr. Stephen Graham creates a group of characters, most of them with just that little rottenness at the core, a touch of self-interestedness combined with dilettantism, which makes them ready victims for such as Gar Lloyd. If any of the characters had been sincere and honest the book would have been depressing; as it is, it provides amusement of a rather bitter type.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS336931440/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=93b63809,"NEW NOVELS THANK YOU, JEEVES.

DE VRIENDT GOES HOME. By ARNOLD
ZWEIG. Translated from the German by ERIc SuTroN. (Heinemann. 7s. 6d. net.)
The theme of Herr Zweig's novel is the politics of Zionism and the relation of Jew and Arab in Palestine to-day. He has brought to it passionate feeling and a marked degree of impartiality, and he has succeeded in creating out of it a story of fine tragic sensibility. The de Vriendt of the title is a Dutch Jew, a scholar and a poet, who has come to the Holy Land almost entirely for reasons of piety and who is completely hostile to the secularization of Jewry and the nationalist aims of the Zionist cause. The story opens in July, 1929, when the dispute between the Jews and the Arabs over the WVailing Wall is reaching a dangerous point of tension. A sincere idealist, de Vriendt displays an irreconcilable fanaticism in regard to his own convictions which greatly strengthens the Arab position, and is killed by an immigrant Jewish youth, who sees in the antiZionist memorandum presented to the [High Commissioner a piece of revolt-
ing treachery. Herr Zweig offers this sequence of events as a prelude to the outbreak of- the disorders in Jerusa]em and throughout the country. The events are mostly seen through the eyes of the head of the Secret Service under the administration of Judea, an Englishman named Henry Irmin. an admirably drawn character. A friend of the murdered man, Irmin is resolved to discover the murderer, whom he realizes from the start is almost certainly a Jew, not an Arab. His investigations provide occasion for an illuminating human commentary on the political problem.
BLOODY MARY'S. By GEOFFREY DENMS.
(Heinemann. 7s. 6d. net.)
A hardened reader he who will not- in imagination at least echo those last cheers for Bloody Mary's and Dr. Paulus Pengelly, called for at the very'end of this story of life at a North Country grammar school about the close of the last century ! When the star of the-great "" Oom Paul,"" four-cane-wielder, terror by day to his pupils and haunter of their dreams by night, sinks finally towards a Somerset rectory, one feels that not only. the school's sun but a genuine planet has gone from the sky. Oom Paul typified his schoolQueen Mary's in the Lancashire market town of Battling. As he, so was it packed with character, and characters. The author seeks to reveal it, and them,' through the simple eyes of the boy the narrator was when pupil there round about the period of the "" Boa Woa."" In this he is really extraordinarily successful; he builds his world solid, totally convincing in its absolute reality, and yet, while preserving this "" boy-angle,"" adds to that early freshness and clarity of vision the deeper intuition, the larger experience"" of subsequent years. The result is oddly satisfying, true to boyhood and at the same time not less so to adult knowledge and understanding. The book is one of episodes rather than narrative, but all well done, and - by turns interesting, -dreadful, dramatic, and extremely funny. - -",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS119482928/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=131958f3,"NEW NOVELS DE VRIENDT GOES HOME.

THE BENT LENS by Lisa Daniel and Claire Jackson, Roundhouse, £9.99 UNTIL THE FINAL HOUR by Traudl Junge, Phoenix, £7.99 THE 19th London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival wrapped up this week, but for those already itching for the 20th, consolation comes with The Bent Lens, an encyclopaedia of what some critics call ""queer cinema"". In fact, this new edition of The Bent Lens takes account of a further development: ""new queer cinema"", whose advent was noted by an ever-alert critical fraternity in 1992. The encyclopaedia's remit is broad, covering both films where sexuality is the central theme and those where it is more tangential. American Beauty is there for its male kiss — although the bits I was awake for suggested that its main argument was something else. And then there are films such as the wonderful American comedy But I'm a Cheerleader, about a holiday camp to which parents send their children for the correction of early signs of homosexuality, where gayness is the core subject of the film.
Going back in time, in movies as in other art forms, coyness, obliqueness or symbolism were unavoidable for the representation of gay themes. In the Sixties, mainstream movies were just about out of the closet, with films such as V7ct/m, The Children's Hour and The Killing of Sister George. But before that, social pressures^ when dealing with the love that dare not speak its name resulted in such bizarre artefacts of high camp as Nicholas Ray's kinky western Johnny Guitar, where Marlboro Country offers something quite different from your average swarthy, cigarette-puffing hero. The Bent Lens also tries to out certain films that I would never have suspected qf harbouring such tendencies — John Ford's The Long Voyage Home for one. A much better candidate would have been Hitchcock's Rebecca, in which Laurence Olivier is camper than a row of tents and Mrs Danvers's feelings for her late mistress are clearly not the usual ones between a housekeeper and her employer. Or maybe they are. Who knows what really goes on in our country houses? Those who have seen the film Downfall, currently doing the rounds, may want to look
at the memoir it is loosely based on, Until the Final Hour by Traudl Junge. She was Adolf Hitler's secretary from November 1942 until her employer shot himself in April 1945, and was present in the bunker in Berlin when he did it. Downfall, despite being in German, will probably reach a wider public, but it is Junge's apparently artless memoir that provides the subtler and more perceptive portrait of the seductiveness of Nazism — written by someone who was herself seduced, and was racked with guilt over it right up to her death in 2002. For one thing it was written in 1947, before reactions to the Nazi experience had been channelled into their prescribed forms. In the film we see Hitler on the edge of reason, twitching, ranting, arbitrarily arresting and appointing, flailing, foundering and foaming. No one could easily be taken in by such a grotesque apology for a human being. The Hitler Junge encountered, however, was a model employer — correct but informal, courteous and gentlemanly. It is as well to remember that the worst people sometimes have the best manners.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0502589426/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=6ae31508,"NEW BOOKS A guide to the gay world and a memoir on the last hours of Hitler are an eclectic mix for Christopher Wood THE BENT LENS by Lisa Daniel and Claire Jackson, Roundhouse, £9.99 UNTIL THE FINAL HOUR by Traudl Junge, Phoenix, £7.99 THE 19th London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival wrapped up this week, but for those already itching for the 20th, consolation comes with The Bent Lens, an encyclopaedia of what some critics call ""queer cinema"".
