Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1892-Mar-28,"London, England","Art Exiiibitions. A Multitude Of Exhibitions Open To The Public To-Day-The Loan Collection At Guildhall, The Socicty Of British Artists In Suffolk-Street, The Three Annual Displays At The Bottom Of The Haymarket, A Collection Of Fine Water-Colours At Mlessrs. Vokinss In Great Portland-Street, A Pleasant Little Gathlering Of Old English Pictures Shown By M.Essrs. Shepherd In Pall-Mall While A Display Of French Pictures Has Been Newly Opened By M.Bernheim In Piccadilly. Leaving The First And The Most Important Of These For A Future Article, We May Briefly Deal With The Others. The Suffolk-Street Galleries Are Once Niore Filled With The Pictures And Drawings Of The Members Of The Society Of British Artists And Of The Not Very Ambitioas Outsiders Wvho Care To Exhibit There. Since The Time Of Its Brief Whistlerian Interliide The Society Has Relapsed Into Something Like The Respectable Dulness Of Its Earlier Time, Though Here And There We Find Upon Its Walls Pictures That Command Attention, Like The Landscapes Cf M.R. Yeend King And Mr. W. S. Jay, The Scenes Of River And Sea Shown By Messrs. Nelson Dawson, Arnold Priestman, And Lifr. Llewellyn, Bits Of Colour By M.R. John Reid And F. Parker, A Few Striking Water-Colours By Mr. F. Davis, Genre Pictures By Mr. J. A. Lomax, And Portraits Or Lifesize Figure Subjects By Mir. Lubert Vos. Probably The Best Picture Bere, From The Painters Point Of Viewv, Is The Faith Of The Last-Named Artist, Who, Unfortunately, Cannot Be Claimed As British, Except By Residence. Ihe Is An Admirable Draughtsman-Witness The Hands In The John Otto Macqueen, Esq. 581 While The Face Of The Old Woman At Her Devotions 140 Is Full Of Expression And Is First-Rate In Painting. Mr. Yeend King Has More Than Once Made His Mark By Large And Elaborately-Painted Landscapes Shown At The Royal Academy, And, Although His Position In The Front Rank Has Not Yet Been Assured, There Are Great Hopes Of His Attaining To It. What He Seems To Want As Yet Is That Power Of Simplification Wvhidh Is Essential To Every Artist, And To The Landscape-Painter Most Of All. Mr. W. S. Jay For Once Deserts His Beech-Woods, Though Not His Wild Pigeons. In The Pea-Field 188 These Beautiful And Always Hungry Creatures Occupy The Foreground In A Wide Landscape, Painted With Much Intelligence. Mr. Dawson, Mr. Llewellyn, And Air. Alfred Hartley All Paint The Late Twilight For These Artists, Like So Many Others Of Their Generation, Are Fond Of Half Tones, And Seem To Avoid The Sunlight As Though It Zvere Almost Vulgar. Their Pictures Have An Undoubted Charm, And Mr. Llewellyns Sketch Of St. Ivos 329 Is Among The Most Artistic Of The Pictures Here. But Theso Artists Belong To A School, And There Are Many Like Them. Mr. Sheiwood Hunter, On The Other Hand, Is Entirely Individual, Though Certain Analogies With His Work Arc To Be Found In That Of Some Of The French Paintets Of The Day. It Is Hard And Over-Emphatic But In The Portraitstudy Of An Old Dutchwvoman Who Has Fallen Asleep Over Her Spinning 313 There Are Remarkable Qualities. If Mir. Hunter, Who Is Evidently A Great Lover Of Rembrandt, Could Add Something Of Rembrandts Atmosphere To Such Work As This, His Pictures Would Be Less Eccentric But More Valuable. Mlr. Yllean Shows Somewhat Fewer Pictures Than Usual, But In Four Cases At Least These Are Of Higher Quality Than Are Commonly To Be Seen In Private Exhibitions, Messrs. Van Haanen, Peter Graham, Henry Moore, And Leon Lliermite Being Represented By Quite First-Rate Examples. No Artist Worlks Mcre Capriciously Or Produces Less Than Mr. Van 3Aanen, Who Follows The Very Permissible Rule Of Only Painting When The Fancy Takes Him, And Whose Pictures Are Therefore As Rare As They Are Admirable. It Is Two Or Three Years At Jeast Since Any New Work From His Hand Was Seen In London, And Now That Be Has Sent An Important Picture Oue Recognizes Once More How Easilv, As Far As Sheer Power Of Painting Goes, He Distances All His Venetian Competitors. The Subject Which The Catalogue Christeds T Dark And Fair Is Simply A Couple Of Girls In The Venetian Dress Of The Present Daythat Is, With Abundance Of Brilliant Colour In Their Gowns And Shawls As Well As In Their Faces Van Haanen Revels In Colour, And The Red Shawl Of The Darl Girl Has Given Him A Splendid Oppcrtunity, Of Which He Has Taken Advantage In Such A Wvay As To Make Us Forget The Ecmparative Thiviality Of The Subject. A Great Contrast To This Maginificent Arrangement Of Reds And Greens And Many Other Colours Is Shown In The Delightful Little Haymaker Of Lhermite 40, A Study Of Cool Blues And Grays, Displaying Great Refinement Of Feeling And A Growing Mastery Of The Bruslh. As To Mlr. Henry Mioore, We Rejoice To Find Him At Work Again, Apparently None The Worse For His Accident, But, On The Other Hand, Able, As In His Summer-Time Off The Channel Islands 33. To Paint The Sea With All His Old Ability And Insight. Mr. Peter Graham Again Has Been Happy In The Subject Which He Calls Caledonia Stern And Wvild 16, And He Has Seldom Of Late Years Equalled These Three Cattle And The Fleecy Mist That Envelops The Hills. Other Painters Here Whose Work Should Be Noticed Are The Hungarian Vastagh, Who Sends A Strongly Painted Lions Head 12, His Countryman Peske, Who Evidently Has Artistic Knowledge As Well As Humour, And The Russian Painter Harlamioff, Whose Sewing-Lesson Is The Best Picture That We Have Seen From His Hand. But Mr. Godwvard, Whopaintslittle Cabinet Pictures Verydext R.Usly, Overrated His Powers When He Ventured On The Life-Size Fancy Portrait Here Called The Rose 30. Next Door, At Messrs. Tooths, Instead Of A Somewhat Ovetwhelming Numler Of Small Pictures, We Have In The Principal Room A Few Large Works Very Well Hung, And To Be Studied At Leisure. The Centres Are Occupied By Two Pictures Of Munkacsy And One By Bouguereau-The Two Former As Effective As Usual And, It Must Be Added, As Tricky In Execution And The Last A Cupid As Beautifully Drawn, As Sentimental, And As Academic As Are All The Performances Of This Still Popular Artist. Other Foreign Painters That We Generally Meet In This Gallery Arc Ml. Deutsch, Joanowitch, Benlliure, Meadrazo, And Jaccuet, And All Of These Have Representative Works In The Present Exhibition M. Joanowitch An Especially Gcod One In The Study Of A Montenegrin Warrior, Which Lie Calls The Leisure Hour 68, And M. Madrazo One That Is Daintier Than Ever, The Artist In Pastel 21. Brilliantly Drawvn, But Cold In Colour, Is M. Detailles En Tirailleur And The Little Rosa Bonheur That Hangs Niext To It Is Of Extreme Beauty. But It Cannot Be Said That British Painters In This Gallery Fall In Any Wvay Behind Their Foreign Rivals, For We Have Sir John Millaiss Grace, Much Improved Since We Saw It At The Royal Academy Wse Have Large And Representative Landscapes By Messrs. Vicat Cole, Leter Graham, Leader, And The Late Kegley Halswello Andwe Have, In A Break In The Stormi -Glen-Lyon 47, The Finest Landscape Yet Produced By That Clever Scotch Painter Mr. David Farquharson. At The French Gallery, Messrs. Wvallis Try With Success The Somewlhat Perilous Experiment F Hanging Three Of Their Walls With New Pictures, Andl The Fourth With Choice Examples Of The Socalled Barbizon Painters. The Place Of Holnour Among The Latter Is Rightly Given To One Of The Most Beautiful Examples Of Corot That Has Been Seen In London While On Either Side Hang Chlarming Cabinet Specimens Of Troyon,Rousseau, And The Rest. There Is Nothing New To Be Said About These Men R Their Works, And It Is Enough To Record Their Presence In The Exbibition. Above Hang Some Of The Charming Little Landscapes Which Puzzled Everybody Wvhen They Appeared At A Recent Sale, And Wvhich, Tllough For Some Reason Or Other They Are Signed M. Cazin, Are Universally Believed To Be The Work Of The Very Emiinent French Landscape Painter J. B. Cazin Himself, And Not Of His Wife. Tlle Puzzle Will Exercise Critics For A Long Tinme To Come, And Until It Is Solved We Imiust Be Content To Judge The Little Pictures On Their Mnerits Anld To Acnire The Feeling And The Colour-Sense Which They Reveal. F Newv Wvorks There Are Characteristic Pictures By Mbi. Seiler, Firle, Joanowvitch, And Many Others, With A Vast Pastoral Landscape By Fauvel From Last Years Salon. But By Far The Most Interesting Is The Ifeili,E Abend, The Cchristmas Eve, Of Fritz Von Ijuie, The German Artist Who, Almost Alone Among His Countrymen, Now Commands The Admniration Of Critics In Paris, London, And The United States. The Exhibition Of His Wvorks Which Messrs. Vwtallis Organized A Short Time Ago Is Still Fresh In The Memory Of Thoso Who Care For Originality And Sincerity In Art, Althoughl It Appeals That Few English Amnateurs Were Enterprising Enougn To Become Possessed Of The Pictures. This Time We Have One Of Those Bits Of What May Be Called Inverted Realism By Which He Tries To Interpret The Bible Story For Us. Just As In The Last Supper Ne Gave Us A Group Of German Peasants At Their Meal, So.Here We Have A German Winters Night, The Ground Deep In Snowr And A Poor German Woman Waiting And Shivering In The Cold, Vhile Her Husband, A Peasant St. Joseph, Trudges Across The Drifts To Seek Shelter For The Hapless Pair In The Village. Only A Faintly Indicated Aureolo Denotes The Sacred Character Of The Woman. Tho Pathos Of The Scene Is Great, However Far It Takes Us From Bethlehem, And The Snowv-Painting Is Masterly In The Extreme. Miessrs. Vokins Have Collected A Large Numbei Of The Choicest Examples Of Some Of Ourold English Water-Colour Artists, Especially William Fut, De Wint, And Copley Fielding, And Have Added Many Drawings By Living Painters, Such As 3R. There Waite,. .5R. Birlket Foster, And Mrs. Allingham. Perhaps It Will Be Felt That The Exhibition Lacks Novelty, Since Not Only Have We Had Two Other Retrospective Exhibitions Of Drawings In Private Galleries Duning The Last Two Months, But At Burlingtonhouse We Have Just Had A -Wall Covered With William Hunts Work. But To M-Y People The Idea That- There Can Be Too Much Of A Good Thing Is Inadmissible, And These May At Least Be Certain That The Best Possible Fare Has Been Provided For Them By Messrs. Vokins. Miessrs. Shepherd, Driven Out Of Their Rooms In King-Street By The Building Operations Which, None Too Soon, Are Transforming Williss Rooms, Have Secured A Well-Lighted Little Gallery At No. 48, Pall-Mall, Which They Have Hung With An Attractive Collection Of Old English Landscapes And Portraits. Some Works Of Lomney, Wilson, Cotman, And The Elder Shayer Are Especially Interesting. Nothing Is Moro In Fashion Just Now Than The Barbizon School And For This Reason It Would Appear That Ml!. Bernheim, The Wvell-Knowvn Dealer Of The Rue Laffitte, Has Opened A Branch In Piccadilly, Near Duke-Street, With A Good Display Of Pictures Of This Class.

An Exhibition Of Modern Danish Art Was Opened At The Brighton Art Galleries On Saturday. Among The Guests Of The Mayor And Mayoress Aiderman And Mrs. Thomas-Stanford, Who Gave A Soiree, Were Mr. Faber, Consul-General For Denmark, Who Performed The Opening Ceremony, Mrs. And Miss Faber, And Professor Tuxen The Danish Court Artist, Two Of Whose Pictures Of The Coronation Of King Edward Have Been Lent By The King And Are Publicly Exhibited For The First Time And Mrs. Tuxen. Before The Opening, The Fine Arts Committee Entertained A Large Company Of Danish And English Guests At Dinner. Mr. Faber, In Declaring The Exhibition Open, Said That It Was The First Collection Of Danish Modern Works Ever Shown In England. Individually, Danish Painters And Sculptors Had Exhibited At The Guildhall, Mt The Works Then Shown Were Retrospectivemostly By Painters Who Had Long Since Passed Away. There Were Only A Few Of Their Artists Of The Present Day Who Had Had Their Pictures Hung On The Walls Of The Guildhall. One Of Them Was Professor Tuxen. The Majority Of The Artists Belonging To The Modern School Of Denmark Now Made Their Bow To The British Public For The First Time, And Not Only They But Danes As A Whole Felt Themselves Under A Deep Debt Of Gratitude To The Brighton Corporation For The Opportunity Of Exhibiting In Those Beautiful Galleries. Queen Alexandra Had Not Only Given Her Patronage But Had Announced Her Desire To Visit The Exhibition. Cheers.

Whether For The Quality Of Its Major Works, The Eircumstantial Or Historical Interest Of Many-Of The Subjects Represented, Or The Unconventional Breadth Of Its Range, The Annual Exhibition Of Early English Water-Colours At Walkers Galleries, 118, New Bond-Street, Is Distinctly Anevent Of The Season. For Anybody Interested In The Subject It Is A Public Occasion-Particularly Since,, In The Course Of Making His Acquisitions, Mr. Augustus Walker Has Become A Recogmized Authority On The Early English School There Can Be No Doubt What Is The Score Of The Present Exhibition-The 25Th Of The Series. It Is The Group Of Four Drawings, Two Of Them Very Large, By Alexander Cozens Fl. 1746-86. They Are All In Monochrome-A Warm Sepia, Or Bistre-Though Bathing Scene Is Touched Here And There With Blue And A Resulting Green. The Most Completely Satisfying In Design Is Rocky Island, Extended Rather Like The Fish Called A Skate On The S Urface Of The Water. Except That It Is In Western Perspective, With Linear And Atmospheric Recession Perfectly Reconciled, It Strongly Recalls The Ink Paintings Of The Chinese, And This Lends Colour To The Story, Generally Believedthough It Has Been- Questioned-That Cozens Was A Natural Son Of Peter The Great, From Whom He May Be Supposed -To Have Inherited A Mongolian Strain. His Son, J. R. Cozens 1752-99, Of Whom Constable Said That He Was All Poetry, Is Represented By A Large And Noble View Of London From Greenwich-1791, With The Dome Of St. Pauls Answering The Two Of The Hospital In The Middle Of The Composition. There Are Two Girtins, Wooded Landscape With Church And House, Which Looks Rather Amateurish And May Excite Some Doubts, And ,Lincoln Cathedral1798, Showing The Western Spires Wlhich, Are No Longer There. This Drawing, With Minor Alterations, Was Engraved As The Frontispiece To Howletts Lincoln, Shown At The Gallery. The Only Example Of J. S. Cotman Is Unimportant, But There Is A Very Splendid De Wint, Country Lane With Cattle Drinking, Coming Near To Cotman In Style, And Richard Wilson Is Represented By An Original Design, In Chalk, For Ir. Grevilles Niobe, From Paul Sandbys Collection. Sandby Himself Has Four Drawings, The High Road, In Particular, Being An Epitome Of The Rural Scene At The Period. The Rest Of The Exhibition-Which Contains 172 Drawings, Including A Few By Foreign Artists-Is Made Up Of Less Famous Names In A Great Variety Of Interest. The Turnpike, Croydon, By James Bourne 1773-1854, Castle Ruins. By F. J. Manskirsch 1770-1827, And Wells Cathedral, By G. F. Robson 1788-1833 May Be Specially Mentioned. There Are Several Unattributed Drawings, Including A Set Of Four Amusing Incidents On The Paddington Canal, Something Between Rowlandson And The Illustration Of The Hunting Of The Snark In Style.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS169156829/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=f3ecfaf6,,
Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1889-Nov-18,"London, England","Abt Exhibitions. At Messrs. Agnews Gallery, In Old Bondstreet, There Opens This Morning An Exhibition That Has Both An Artistic And An Historical Interest. It Is That Of A Series Of Drawings Illustrative Of Characters And Scenery Associated With Mary Stuart, Queen Of Scots The Artists Are Sir James Linton And Mr. James Orroel-, Of Whom The Former Contributes A Dozen Figure-Subjects, And The Latter About A Hundred Landscapes, Mostly Of Small Size. From The Historical Point Of View, The Figure-Subjects Must Of Course Be The Less Satisfactory, For It Will Always Be More Or Less A Matter Of Guesswork To Attempt To Give The Features Of The Queens Marys, Or Of Hamilton Of Bothwellhaugh, Or Of George Douglas, Or Of Any Other Of The Queens Friends Or Foes.- Indeed, As Everybody Agreed Last Winter After A Visit To The Stuart Exhibition, None Of The Authentic Portlaits Of The Queen Herself Really Explain Heir Extraordinary Fascinations, And If Sir James Linton In Depicting Her Had Merely Copied The Wyi4Dsor Miniature Or The Likeness Knoown As The Deuil Blanc He Would Have Given. Us The Idea Of A Not Very Attractive Woman. So He Has Perforce Been Thrown Back Upon His Own Ideals And His Own Models, With The Result That His Drawings Are Not Very Different From The Figures That We Have Been Accustomed To See From His Hand At The Institute And Elsewhere. The Painting, As One Might Expect, Is Of Remarkable Quality, And In The Best Drawings, Such As The 1 Darnley 23, The Mary Livingstone 107, And The Eamilton 101, Sir James Lintons Sense Of Rich And Even Splendid Colour Anid His Power Of Obtaining Strong Effects While Using Methods That Are Almost Thoso Of The Miniaturist Are Very Conspicuous. In The Landscape Work Mr. Orrock Has Certainly Bettered All His Previous Performances. Not Only Has He Followed The Steps Of The Unhappy Queen With The Raost Scrupulous Fidelity, And Given Us Faithful Drawings Of Iolyrood, Of Stirling, Of St. Andrews, Of Lochleven, Of Bolton, Tutbury, Fotheringhay, And Peterborough, But He Has Drawn Everything With A Freshness And Truth That Are Charming. A S Is Well Kmnown, Mr. Orrock Is Frankly A Follower Of The Methods Of Those Great English Water-Colour Artists Who Were The Lights Of The Last Generation But This Does Not Prevent Him From Seeing With His Own Eyes And Impressing An Individuaflcharactcr Upon His Work. It Is Difficult To Pick Out The Best Out Of So Many Drawings, But One Might Specify As Particularly Good And Artistic Bolton Castle 12, Tutbury Castle 15, The Two Views Of Stirling 24 And 27, And Several Of The Smaller And Slighter Sketches At The End Of The Room. We May Add That The Catalogue Is Annotated With Much Learning And Discretion By Mr. Walter Armstrong, Who Shows Himself Quite As Well Qualified To Write History As He Is To Criticize Art. Mr. Mlendoza, Of King-Street, St. Jamess, Has Opened His Usual Winter Exhibition Of Drawings In Black And White, To Which Are Added A Few Pastels. Such A Collection Is Aproof,If Proof Were Needed,Of The Amount Of Good Work That Is Now Being Done In England By Artists Who Have Not Attained To Fame, And Especially By Ladies. A Pastel Head By Miss Gemmell, A Harbour Scene By Miss Webb, And A Little Group, In Caldecutts Manner, By Miss Pocock, Are Instances In Point. There Are Also Some More Highly-Finished Performances, Such As The Pastel Fancy-Subjects By The Roman Artist, .Giannetti.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS67817842/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=5450f72b,,

There Is Nothing In The Very Least Tentative About Them A Photographic Likeness Is Obtained With Cold Precision And With What Appears To Be A Truly Astonishing Certainty, While, For The Rest Of The Picture, The Painter Might As Well Have Been Making A Map For All The Evidence There Is Of Anything But Methodical Calculation The One Or Two Landscapes In The Exhibition Show How Indifferent Mr. Gunn Is To Anything Except Making A Record Of The Relative Position Of Everything In The Scene. Once This Is Done, He Appears To Be Able To Proceed At Once And Without Making Any Significant Changes, By A Process Which Can Only Be Called Enlargement, To The Full-Size Portrait. If, Indeed, Thcsc Unhesitant And Impersonal Statements Really Are The Paintees Very First Impressions, One Can Only Be Amazed At This Revelation Of The Workings Of So Rare, So Unerring, And So Completely Specialized A Faculty, Which Allows Itself To Be Distracted By None Of The Usual Considerations Which Are Present In The Normal Painters Mind When He First Views His Subject.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS102711993/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=2d7c5bce,,

Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1903-Mar-30,"London, England","Mr. Watts, Though His Name Is A Household Word, Among Those Who Care For Art, Has Never Been A Painter Of Popular Pictures. His Grave And. Conscientious Work Has Won For Him Something Better Than Mere Popularity. He Takes His Place Among The Greatest Artists Of His Age, And Has A Position All His Own In Virtue Of His Portraits And His Allegories. No One Has Painted, Portraits With Greater Insight And Distinction No One Has Rendered Allegory More Profitably, Or More Impressively. Any Collection Of Works By Mr. Watts Must Command Attention But A Special Interest Attaches To The 30 Or 40 Examples That Are Now Shown At Leighton-House, Because They Represent Him At Various Periods Of His Career, From 1838 And 1840 To The Present Day. Some Men. Turner, For Instance, And Millais, Passed Through Definite Stages And Changes. This Is Hardly True Of Mr. Watts, Whose Methods Have Changed More Than, His Style Or His Aims. The Thinly Painted Pictures Of His Earlier Year?. Have Been Superseded By His Later And More Solid Technique. And He Professes Himself A Student Still, For Art Is Longer Than The 66 Years Spent In Its Pursuit, And Some Work Of Noble Note May Yet Be Done. Several Charming Small Pictures Take Us Back To The Year 1838 A Large Canvas Showing A Group Of Halfdraped Girls Seems To Be The Result Of His Italian Student Life Last Of All Comes Love Steering The Barque Of Humanity From Last Years New Gallery. Between These Widely Distant Dates, How Many Strong Portraits, How Much Magnificent Colour, Have We To Admire In His Continuous But Newer Superabundant Work I Most Of It Is Elsewhere, But Enough Is Here To Enable Us To Study The Growth And The Maturity Of The Artist And The Persistence Of Undiminished Power In Old Age. A Roomful Of Excellent Modern Pictures Is To Be Found At The Goupil Gallery, At The Bottom Of Regent-Street. The Collection Is Of An Agreeably Varied Character, For It Ranges From One Or Two Works Of. The Barbizon School To Those Of A French .Artist, M. Lebottrg, Who Has Not Hitherto Been Seen In London. His Crdpusctde Is Impressionist But He Does Not Carry His Principles To An Extreme, And The Result Is A Compromise Of Great Beauty And Elegance. Perhaps The Principal Landscapes Are The Two Companion Harpignies, Morning, And Evening, The One Cold And Touched With Chilly Silver, And The Other Glowing With The Warm Air Of Sunset. Moonlight Is Seldom Painted With Such Skill As Is Shown By Lupines River Scene.. It Is A Most Difficult Subject, But Hero All Seems In Absolute Keeping. Yet, For All That May Be Said For These End. Other Landscapes, Not All Of Them French, By The Way, The Gem Of The Gallery Is The Little Charles Jacque. Once More We Have His Frequent Subject, Sheep Near The Edge Of The Forest A Perfectly Simple Affair, But Invested With Extreme Dignity And Truth. Besides- These, And. Others That Are Worthy Of Their Company, There Are Examples Of Work That Is Not Only Modern, But As New As Possible, In The Shape Of Pictures In The New Solid Oil-Colours. Now And. Then, As With Mr. Peppercorns Breezy Weather, They Suggest Great Speed, Of Execution, Though Perhaps This Spirited Performance Would, Have Been None The Worse For A Little More Deliberation. It Is A Sketch, But Ordinary Oil Sketches Are Not Impossible. And Now And Then The New Colours Are Used In Such A Way As To Be Almost Indistinguishable From Brush Work But More Often They Resemble Pastel, It Is Believed With More Permanence And Less Liability To Injury. Time Will Show How Far That Claim Is Justified Meanwhile, The Specimens Here Add To The Interest Of The Exhibition. There Are Three Little Exhibitions At Messrs, Gravess Galleries In Fall-Mall. Mr. Haywards Lowers Are Painted With Much Feeling For Colour, And The Few Water-Colours By Mr, Hayward Which Hang Beside Them Are Accomplished And Wholly Unpretending. Mrs. Adrian Hopes Friends And Fancies In Another Room Are In Part Pastel Portraits Of Good Quality, And In Part Fanciful Water-Colour Drawings Of Children, Animals, And Fairies Slight Enough, But An Amusing Combination Of Stothard And Alice In Wonderland. In Yet Another Room Are A Few Of Mr. Ben Austrians Game Hen And Chick Pictures. If His Source Of Inspiration Is Unusual, His Drawing Is Quite Beyond, Reproach. He Is An American Artist, And. Has Made Subjects Of This Kind His Special Study. - - 1 , I I I R 1 I",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS67431550/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=25ed0c7b,,
Null,Art Exhibitions In London,The Times,1943-Jun-15,"London, England","Entertainments Art Exhibitions In London A Wide Range June Is A Favourite Month For Picture Exhibitions, And During The Past Few Days Several Have Opened In London Which Are Well Worth A Visit From Those Who Enjoy Exercising Their Own Taste And Judgment, Whether Approving Or The Reverse. Among These Are Two One-Man Shows By Painters Employing Advanced Modern Technique. At The Redfern Gallery Mr. Jankel Adler, An Expressionist Artist Born In Poland In 1895, And Now In This Country, Is Exhibiting A Group Of Paintings Which May Perhaps Be Best Suggested By Saying That They Contain A Mixture Of Human, Or Other Recogmizable, Forns With Geometrical Shapes, The Whole So Arranged As To Suggest A Mood. His Colour Is Generally Strong And Glowing, And His Work Has A Certain Force, Thought It Is Strongly Alien, Or Even Repellent, To Most English Minds. Occasionally, As In The Two Dancer Pictures, He Uses Softer Colour, And A Style Approximating More Nearly To Our Conception Of Caricature, Which Make For Easier Understanding And Acceptance. Mr. Robert Colquhoun, Whose Work Is On View At The Lefevre Galleries, Is A Young Scottish Painter Who Has Worked A Good Deal Abroad. His Paintings Show Many Contemporary Influences, And In Spite Of His Fondness For Strong Colours. Especally Reds, He Does Not Yet Seem To Have Found Himself As A Colourist Nor To Achieve The Full Richness At Which He Seems To Be Aiming. A Mixed Collection Of Pictures By Sir William Nicholson, Mr. John, And Others Is Also At This Gallery. Tunisia And Egypt It Is A Very Different World Into Which One Steps At The ,Walker Galleries, Where Mr. Walker Tyndale Is Showing Some 20 Watercolours Of Tunisia And Egypt. Mr. Tyndale Is Now A Very Old Hand At The Type Of Watercolour Which Is Essentially An Illustration Of Travel-A Type Which Must Always Have A Certain Value Though It Is Somewhat Unfashionable At The Moment. Many Of His Subjects, Such As A Laundry At Gabes, A Street In Sfax, And A Suk In Tunis, Have A Topical Interest Just Now, And They Are, Moreover, Very Skilfully Done-It Is Noticeable, For Instance, How Much Life There Is In His Figures, Which Are Never Merely Decorative Adjuncts Of The Scene. At The Institut Francais, South Kensington, Is A Loan Collection Of More Or Less Modem Pictures By Artists Of Many Nationalities. There Are Several Good Things-Two Drawings By Picasso, For Example, And An Admirably Gloomy House By James Pryde-But On The Whole The Show Is Rather A Jumble As Regards Both Style And Merit. Mr. Paul Larsen Is Once Again Holding His Annual Exhibition Of Old Master Paintings At 43, Duke Street, S.W. They Are Chiefly English And Duich Or Flemish. The English Pictures Include A Small Anonymous Portrait Of Edward Vl, And, Of Later Works, Examples Of Lawrence, Hoppner, And The Pastellist John Russell. There Are Several Decorative Dutch Flower Pieces, And Among The Flemish Pictures Are Two Extremely Entertaining Examples Of Jan Van Kessel 1626.79 Illustrating Two Of The Senses- Sound And Taste. These Are Full Of Amusing And Historically Interesting Detail.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS134823119/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=d5919228,,
Null,Minor Art Exhibitions,The Times,1899-Jun-19,"London, England","1Llno Art Bxeibitions. Mr. F. C. Goulds Political Cartoons Arc So Well Known That It Is Hardly Necessary To Do More Than Call Tteution To The Collection Of His Work For The Last Year Or So That Is Now To Bo Seen In The Continental Gauery In Bond-Street. Hii Drawings Are Generally Reprodueced In So Ephemeral A Manner That It Is Au The More Desirabl, To See Them In Their Original Form. Undoubtedly His Excellent Draughtsmanship, His Invention, And His Sense Of Hnmour Make Hiuo, We Will Not Say First In His Art Whilo Sir John Tenaiel Is Vwith Us, But A Good Secoud To Any Of The Masters Of Caricature. Ele Owes Something To Them, Of Course, But His Humour Und Hs Ingernuity Are All His Own. One Of His Most Charucteristie Drawings Represents Ir. Goschen As S Stork And Mr. Chamt Berlain As A Fox. The Fornmer Remarks, T Propios Of The Increased Navy Estimates, My Bill Is As Long As Your Spoon To Which The Fox Replies, Yes, And Now We Can Go And Have Supper With The Bear. Nothing Can Be Happier Than 31R Goulds Metbod Of Blending His Politicians With Judiciously Chosen Birds And Quadrupeds. Botb His Animal Forms And His Buman Likenesses Are Exceedingly Truthful And-Crowning Merit In A Caricaturist-There Is No Oralice In His Sharpest Joke. Messrs. Cassells Black And White Exhibition, Which Is Being Held This Year At Catlers Hall, Warwicklane, Newgate-Street, Is Again A Distinct Success. By The Expression Blaek And Mhite Almost Everything Is Meant Except Colour. A Wide Choice Of Metbod Remains, From The Primitive Pen And Ink To More Elaborate Processes And The Result Is An Exhibition Of Treat Interest As Regards Both Portraits And Landecapes. Mr. Fulleylove, Mr. Caton Woodville, Mr. Railton, And Mr. C. W. Wyllie Are Ameng The Principal Contributors. With These Drawings May Be Compared Or Contrasted The L,Lack And White Work Of Two Associated Artists, Nature And Sciewce, Which Is To Be Seen On Tuesdays And Fridays At The Rootms Of The Camera Club In Charing-Cross-Road. It Represents The Latest Advances In The Art Of Photography, Which Cannot In These Days Be Cbarged With Any Wsnt Of The Artistic Spirit. It Has, Indeed, Been The Constant Aim Of Photographers To Bring The Personal Element Into Their Vork. The Photographs Bere Are As Fine As Any That Have Been Exhibited, And Sbow Not Only The Highest Technical Excelleuce, But Also A Surprising Degree Of Individuslity. A Display Of Mr. George Woodalls Beautiful Sculptured Glass Is Now On View At Mlessrs Phillips In Mount-Street. It Is A Development Of The Art Of Cameo-Cuttidg, The Material Being, Xot The Minute Gems In Which The Ancient Altists Worked, Or The Shells Used By Their Modern Roman Snecessors, But Large Layers Of Differently Tinted And Semi-Opaque Glass, The Upper Layer White, And The Lower Dark Red, Dark Blue, Or Dark Green. These Are Amply Sufficient For Lr Woodalls Purpose. He Is At Onee The Artist And The Executant Workman. Ihe Classica Designs Are His, A Little After The Style Of Flxmkan. But Less Severe, And With Fuller Pictorial Effects Of Light Anid Shade And Transparent Drapery And Be Alone Has Carved Them. Patieutly And Slowly, Until These Glass Vases And Plaques Become Something That Is Half Picture Gnd Half Sculpture Here Is As True A Combination Of Art And Craft As Can Possibly Be Found. The Nature Of Thc Material Necessitates The Utmost Delicacy Of Hand, And The Work Cannot But Proceed Very Deliberately. It Is. Therefore, All The More Provoking Thatit Should Be Liable To Unforeseen Accidents In The Shape Of Flaws And Air-Bubbles That May Be Discovered, Perhaps After Weeks Of Work, In The Glass Itself. Ibi Szis Effuc S Labor. When This Bappens, The Cmmeo Cannot Be The Perfect Thing Intended By The Artist. It Is Hoped That A Preliminary Examination Of The Glass By The X Rays May Show The Existence Of All Latent Flawsr Before The Artist Begins His Work But It Ia.Nut Yet Certain Whether Tho Test Whin Be Cet4Aal",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS100984019/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=848f696a,,
Null,Industrial Art,The Times,1932-May-24,"London, England","Industrial Art Desirability Of Exhibitions Gorell Committees Recommendations The Report Of Lord Gorells Conmmittee On Alt And Industry Is Issued To-Day Stationery Office, Is.. The Comniittee Vas Appointed In July, 1931, As One Of The Last Official Acts Of The Late Mr. William Graham, Then President Of The Board Of Trade, To Consider The Desirability Of Forrming Exhibitions Of Articles Of Every-Day Use And Good Design Of Ctrrent Manufacture. Under The Chairmanslip Of Lord Gorell The Committee Held 13 Meetings, Taking Evidence From Govermnent Departments, Associations, And Individuals. The Following Are Its Principal Recoimnendations A Central Body Responsible For Exhibitions Of Industrial Art Should Be Established With Executive Powers, In Close Association With The Department- Of Overseas Trade. Ideally, There Should Be In London A Special Building For Exhibitions Of Industrial Art. As An Immediate Practical Step An Existing-Building Centrally Situated Should Be Utilized. There Should Be Organized In London At Regularly Recurring Intervals Exhibitions Of Articles Of High Qualitv And Modern Manufacture Allied In Category, To Remain Open To The Public For Approximately Six Weeks. The Organi7Ation Of A Standing Exhibition I.E., Continuously Open, Though Constantly Changing Should Be Left For The Consideration Of The Proposed New Body When Adequate Experience And Finance Have Been Secured. The Main Periodic Exhibition Should Be Supplemented Bv Occasional Exliibitions In London And Elsewvhere, Including Exhibitions For Special Trades Or Special Purposes. Later, Travelling Exhibitions Should Be Undertaken Froni Time To Time In This Country. Later, Again, Exhibitions Abroad, Including Travelling Exhibitions, Should Be Undertaken. Suitable Provision Should Be Made For Acquiring By Gift Or Purchase Some Of The Best Examples Showvn In The Periodic And Other Exhibitions, And For Their Display To The Public, Pending The Absorption Into The National Collections Of Such Of Them As Are Eventually Judged Worthy Of This Honour. The Object Of Exhibitions Should Be The Improvement Of The Taste Of Designers, Manufacturers, Distributors, And The General Public By The Display To The Best Advantage Of Beautiful Modern Manufactured Goods, Due Regard Being Paid To The Purchasing Power Of The Householder Of Moderate Means. The Activities Of The British Institute Of Industrial Art And Voluntary Associations, So Far As The Organization Of Exhibitions Of The Above Tvpes Is Concerned, Should Be Unified And Placed At The Disposal Of The New National Organization. Apart From Exhibitions, The Government Should Prosecute Concurrent Measures Aiminat Improved Status For The Best Inldustrial Artists, Increased Use Of First-Rate Artists By Manufacturers, Better Art Education, Research Into The Needs Of Particular Inidustries, And A Safeguarding Of Artistic Materials, And Should Make The Board Of Trade Specificallv Responsible For The Advancement Of Industrial I Art In This Country. Function Of Educaltion The Committee State That Their Purpose Has Been To Discover How Exhibitions Of Industrial Art Can, In Modern Conditions Of Education And Commerce, Best Be Harnessed To The Joint Servce Of Art And Industry And Assist Towards The Production And Distribution Of Goods Of High Quality And United Kingdom Manufacture. The View Is Expressed, However, That The Mere Organization Of Such Exhibitions Is Incapable By Itself Of Solving The Vital Problem How Best To Raise The Level Of Industrial Art In The United Kiingdom. There Must, In The Committees Judgment, Be A Concurrent National Effort To Improve The Design And Quality Of The Products Exhibited, But Such Measures As The Improvement Of The Training Of All Who Participate, Whether As Designers, Manufacturers, Craftsmen, Or Wvholesale Or Ietail Buyers And Sellers, In Creating And Distributing The Products Of Industrial Art. It Follows That The E4Ucation Provided In The Art And Trade Schools, And Also In Public, Secondary, And Elementary Schools, In The Directions Botlh Of Creative Artistic Work And Of Appreciation, Is Of Fundamental Importance. From The Historical Summary With W Hich The Report Begins Two Facts Emerge-The Extent To Whicl Past Efforts To Improve Industrial Art On The Trade Side Have Been Diffused Instead Of Concentrated, And The Absence Of Any Satisfactory Solution Of The Difficulties, In Spite Of The Attention Whichl Has Been Devoted To The Problem. After Drawving Attention To Thesc Points Thc Report Continues - The Change That Has Taken Place Within The Last Decade In The Character And Volume Of The Import And Export Trade Of This Country Renders It, In Our Opinion, Impossible To Allow The Matter To Remain Longer In Its Present State. Under The Traditional System Of Free Imports, Which Is Now Ended, Manufacturers Had At Any Rate Strong Incentives To Secure That The Products And Manufactures Of This Country Should Be So Designed As To Be Able To Compete On All Points Wvith The Products And Manufactures Of Our Great Industrial Competitors. As, However, The Element Of Competition Is Now To Be Reduced By The Creation Of Artificial Barriers Round The Home Market, It Becomes Imperative That The Nation Should Redouble Its Efforts To Improve Its Standards Of Taste And Quality, And. Should Not Be Lulled Into A False Sense Of Security By The Increased Control Ov Cr The Homc Market That Is Secured By Tariffs. The Duty Of Maintaining Standards Is In Direct Ratio To The Degree Of Protection Afforded To Manufacturers. Plowers Of Centhral Body It Is Considered Essential That Tho Central Body Responsible For Exhibitions Should Be I Entrusted With Executive Povcrs, And The Comnm Mittee Recommend L That The Members Should I Be Appointed By The President Of The Board Of Trade, Who Would Thus Be Responsible To Parliament For Its Activities. One Member Should Represent Tle Department Of Overseas Trade Or The Board Of Trade, One Should Be Appointed After Consultation With The President Of The Board Of Education, One After Consultation W Ith The Secretary Of State For Scotland, And A Few Members With Experience Of Manufacture, Wholesale Trade, And Retail Trade Should Be Included. The Members Of The Central Bodv Should, Howevver, Be Primarily Chosen Not As Representing Particular Sections Of The Community, But As Persons Of Taste And Cultural Standards, With An Up-Todate And, As Far As Possible, An International Outlook On Art. Discussing Finance, The Committee State That They Have Confined Themselves To Nroviding A Conservative Estimate For An Immediately Practicable Scheme. This Estimate Covering The Hire And Decoration Of Halls, Packing, Transport, And Insurance Of Exhibits, Lease Of Office Premises, Office Equipment, Heating, Lighting, Cleaning, General Maintenance Expenses, Honoraria For Chairman And Members Of The Central Body And Salaries Of Staffs, Gives The Cost Of Such A Scheme As Not Less Than 10,000 A Year. To Meet This Cedenditure Some Revenue Might Be Obtained From Sources That Might Be Described As Internal-By Charges For Space, The Formation Of A Body Of Subscribers, Trade Levy Charges For Admission, Commission O,U Sales, Sawe Of Catalogues, And So Forth. Mr. Roger Fry, A Member Of The Committee. Suggests In An Appendix To The Reuort A Scheme For The Establishment Of Workshops Of Decorative Design, Under A Controller Of Design Whose Status Would Be That Of A Governmient Official, Of A Class Akin To 11.I. Inspectors Of Schools. I I I I I I I Ii I I I",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS337323704/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=0fd175e4,,
Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1925-May-21,"London, England","Art Exhibitions. Country Life. Ruraj Associations Plav Such A Large Part In The Exhibition Of Woiks By Lady Helena Gleichen, Mr. Maurice Chesterton, And Mr. Charles Simpson At The Alpine Club Gallery That Artistic Interest Seems An Unworthy Substitute For Cider. The Paintings Of Horses And Dogs By Ladv Gleichen Show Not Only An Intimate General Knowledge Of The Subjects But Also The Somewvhat Rarer Capacity To Distinguish An Individual Of The Species And To Paint A True Portrait Of The Animal Concerned. To This Is Added A Feeling For Characteristic Surroundings, With The Result That Lady Gleichen Is, Not Only Able To Present Luack Shire Hiorse, Wave On, A Hunter, And Chang, A Chow Dog, To The Life, But Also On Occasion To Depart From Her Models And Weave Animnals And Landscape Into A Decorative Eomposition, As Hunting Frieze, And The Designs For Bed-Backs And Overmantels. Some Vigorous Representations Of Incidents On The Itelian Front During The War Prove Her Grasp Of The Larger Requirements Of A Picture, And Among The Small Direct Sketches From Nature There Are Some Delightful Thingsi Pink Pigs, Crakenthorpe Hiall, Westmorland, And Winter, For Examples. Fr. Chesterton Shows Water-Colours And Architectural Models Of Buildings, And Since They Are Mostly Farm Buildings In Gloucestershire The Rurail Note Or The Exhibition Is Not Diisturbed. . E Has-Evidently Steeped Himself In The Cotswold Tradition And Then Devoted All His Energies To Meeting Practical Requirements With Simplicity And Economy And An Eye To Good Proportions, Using Grey Thatch As The Best Substitute For Roofing Stones. The Most Interesting Of His Models Is That Of Dairy Farm For 40 Cows, Now In Course Of Construction For Sir Walter Preston, At Tetburv. In This, Mr. Chesterton Has Adopted The Bold- Expedient Of A Circular Plan For The Administrative Offices, Avoiding The Weak Effect Of Curved Roof L?Ie By A Central Tower At The Junction With The Straight Range Of Cowsheds. All The Praetical Requirements In This, And In Dairy Farm, For Colonel E. F. Morrison-Bell, Seem To Have Been Carefully Considered And Ingeniously Worked Out From The Point Of View Of Convenience, And They And The Others, Including A Sheltered Water - Garden Designed For A Windy Site, With Their Landscape Backgrounds, Are Very Pretty Models. In Water-Colour Mr. Chesterton Is Clear, Simple, And Decorative, On The Cotswolds,. Tidal River, And Poetry And Prose, A Factory Subject In Twilight, Being Good Examnles Of His Work. Mr-. Simpson, Who Is The Most Accomplished Painter Of The Three, Takes Us To Cornwall, With Special Reference To Seabirds And Waterfowl. His Special Gifts Are A Natural Sense Of Composition And An Extraordinary Appreciation Of Tone Values. Always He Is At His Best When He Relies Most Explicitly On These Capacities, And Formality-Which Is Often A Help To An Artist With An Imperfect Eye For Tone-Is A Hindrance To Him. Creditable As They Are His Two Decorative Screens Are Not Really So Good As The Large Painting Of Curlew, Loosely Wreathed Upon The Pale Gold Water. Gulls In Hlarbour, Solitary Gull, And Wild Swans Are Other Excellent Paintings Of Birds. Mr. Simpson Also Shows A Number Of Pastel-Or Crayondrawings Of The Wilder Aspects Of Cornwall.

FROM OUR ART CRITIC,Walker Art Gallery,The Times,1932-Oct-07,"London, England","Walker Art Gallery -.. . Special Autumn Exhibition From Our Art Critic Liverpool, Oct. 6 Irrespective Of Its Special Characterworks By Lancashire And Cheshire Artists Exclusively-The Autumn Exhibition At The Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, Which Was Opened To-Day By Lord Crawford And Balcarres, Has A Special Significance This Year Because Its Limitations Were Decided By The Reconstruction Of The Gallery That Is Now Being Carried Out. By All The Signs Next Year Liverpool Will Have An Artistic Opportunity So Great As To Be Almost Frightening. Seven Galleries Are Being Added, One Of Them. At Least, Among The Largest In The Country-Something Like The Big Venetian Room At The National Gallery. It Is Too Early Yet To Speak Of The Architectural Character Of The Additions By Messrs. Briggs And Thornley, The Architects Of The New Parliament Buildings Of Northern Ireland, But, Particularly In Lighting,Thepromise Is High. Nor Is This The Place To Suggest An Artistic Programme For Liverpool, But The Opportunity To Lay Down A First-Rate Permanent Collectionworthy Of The Nucleus Provided By The Roscoe Primitives And The Half-Dozen Or So Of The Most Celebrated Works By The English Pre-Raphaelites-And To Arrange Really Representative Loan Exhibitions Will Deserve, And Need, The Highest Efforts Of Which The Libraries, Museums, And Arts Committee And The New Director, Mr. Frank Lambert, Are Capable. There Are Signs, Too, In The Present Exhibition That Liverpool Is At Last Waking Up Artistically. Nobody Who Prefers A Clear To A Confused Artistic Experience Will Regret The Absence Of The Usual Padding, From The Academy And Elsewvhere, Which Has Hitherto Made The Liverpool Autumn Exhibition Too Much Like A Lancashire High Tea. The Best Tribute To This Exhibition Is To Say That The Rank And File Of Local Artists Have Never Before Made Such A Respectable Impression. But The Advantages Of The Exhibition Do Not End With The Better Representation Of The Rank And File For The Scope Has Been Wisely Extended To Artists Who Have Associations With The Two Counties As Teachers Or- Students. This Means That, Besides Mr. P. Wilson Steer, O.M., Who Was Born At Birkenhead, The Exhibition Includes The Two Other Artists Who, In The Opinion Of Most People, Share With Him The Leading Place In Contemporary English Painting Mr. Augustus John, R.A., And Mr. W. R. Sickert, A.R.A. Galleries Well Arranged The Exhibition Is Very Well Arranged. Consisting Of 659 Works In All Mediums, It Is, Of Necessity, Rather Closely Hung In The Limited Space Of The Ground-Floor Galleries, But In Such Good Order That Everything Can Be Seen Properly. A Very Fine Group Is Made In The Entrance Hall By Mlr. Johns Portrait Of H. Chaloner Dowdall, Esqre., Lord Mayor Of Liverpool, 1908-1909, And Footman Smith, And Two Steers The Horseshoe Bend Of The Severn, In His Earlier Manner Of More Precise Definition, From Aberdeen, And The Lovely Music Room, From The Tate Gallery. At This Time Of Day It Is Difficult To See Why Mr. Johns Portrait Group Was Not Popular On Its First Appearance. The Lord Mavor Cuts A Dignified Figure, And The Inclusion Of The Footman, With Sword Of Office, Adds Greatly To The Effect Of Civic Splendour, ,Besides Helping The Composition. This Is The Only John, But The Selection Of Works By Mr. Steer Elsewhere In The Exhibition Shows The Full Range Of His Developnient. In The Present Exhibition There Are Four Works By Mr. Sickert The Early, And Very Touching, Mamma Mia Poveretta, A Study Of An Old Venetian Woman, From Manchester, The Little Mother. A Drawing Of Dieppe Harbour And Summer Lightning -One Of His Recent English Echoes. Mr. Sickert Is Represented In The Permanent Collection Only By An Etching. The Names Of Mr. Philip Connard, R.A., Professor Randolph Schwabe, Mr. Robert Anning Bell, R.A., Sir Charles 1. Holines, Mr. John Copley, The Late Mr. Christopher Wood, Mr. Bernard Meninsky, Miss Frances Hodgkins, Mr. Matthew Smith, Mr. Allan Walton, Mr. Terrick Williams, A.R.A., Mr. Adrian Stokes, R.A., Mr. Svdney Lee, R.A., Mr. Francis Dodd, A.R.A., And Mr. S J. Lamorna Birch, R.A., All Represented In This Exhibition By Characteristic Works, Will Suggest The Quality-And Range In Style-Of Some Of The Other Artists Wvho Have Been Associated With Lancashire Or Cheshire At Some Time In Their Career. Lesser-Known Artists Among The Excellent Works By Artists Who Are Less Familiar In London May Be Noted The Blue Boat, By Miss Jessie Pescod-Malcolm Professor Wilberforce, By Mr. Edward 1. Halliday And The Willow Tree, By Mr. Karl Hagedorn But Allowing For Variety Of Taste The Average Quality Is Good Throughout The Exhibition. There Is A Collection Of Prints And Drawings, And One Room Has Been Set Aside For Works Of A Modern Tendency, Which Does Not Appear To Mean Anything More Alarming Than Increased Attention To The Picture, As A Picture, Irrespective Of What It Happens To Represent. The Autumn Exhibition At The Walker Art Gallery Does Not Exhaisst The Artistic And Associated Interests Of Liverpool At The Moment. At The Public Museum There Is An Exhibition Of Shipping In The Exhibition Hall Of The Central Library There Are Photographs From The Times The Picton Reading Room Has A Special Exhibition Of Prints And At The Old Bluecoat Schools There Is The First Annual Exhibition Of Ship Models, Made By Members Of The Ship Model Society.

Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1907-Nov-04,"London, England","Art Exhibitions. Besides The New English Art Club, Which Has Now Obtained A Quite Respectable Age, Two Other Clubs Or Societies O Artistshave Added Themselves To Thu Number Of Such Institutions, As Though There Were Not More Than Enough Already. When The Portrait Painters And The Twenty-Five Open In A Few Days, To Be Immediately Followed By The Old Water-Colour Society, There Will Be No Less Than Nine Of These Large Exhibitions On View In The West-End Of London, Not To Mention One Man And Onewoman Shows At Various Dealers Galleries. One Can Only Hope That All This Activity On The Part Of Modern English Artists Meets With Its Due Reward, Though It Is Hard To Say Where The Purchasers Of So Many New Pictures And Sketches Are To Come From. We Must Assume, However, That The Artists And. Their Men Of Business Know How To Keep Some Kind Of Balance Between Supply And Demand, Though It Is Difficult To Reconcile The Increasing Output With The Almost Universal Complaints That One Hears About Slack Trade. These Questions, However, Are Not Quite To The Point Just Now, When What Concerns Us Is The Merits And Demerits Of The New English And Other Exhibitions. The Small Gallery In Dering-Yard 67A, New Bond-Street Opens With A Fair Average Show, But One Altogether Less Interesting Than That Of Last May. The Chief Impression Made On The Visitor Is That The Tide Of Artistic Fashion At The Moment Must Have Set Towards Montreuil In Piccardy, Whose Marketplace, Church, Old Court-Yards, And Old Gardens Seem To Have Been The Summer Inspiration Of Mr. Wilson Steer, Mr. Hopwood, Professor Fred Brown, And Several Other Members. Is There To Be A Montreuil School As A Sequel And Rival Of The School Of Barbizon ? Hardly, For An Old Town, Charming Though It May Be, Cannot Supply The Infinite Variety Of Themes That Millet And Rousseau And Their Friends Found In The Forest Of Fontainebleau. But In At Least Two Of The Pictures Of This Little Place There Is Real Charm And Beauty In Mr. Steers Court-Yard And In Mr. Browns Market Day, Studies Of Brilliant Light Upon Old. Houses And, In The Latter Case, Upon A Crowd Of Moving Figures. One Of Mr. Steers Figures, However, Is A Puzzle What Is The Womans Black Head Doing In That Position ? Two Other Leading Members Of The Club Have Pictures That Will Attract Notice, Mr.-Tonks With His Bird-Cage 108 And Mr. Orpen With His Grace Orpen 59, And His Small, Seated Portrait Of Mr. Percy Wyndham In His Library 84. The Last Is Excellent A Good Likeness, Though A Little Stiffly Posed, And The Background Painted With What So Few Artists Can Combinea Right Sense Of Values And A Thorough Observation Of Detail. The . Portrait Of The Artists Wife Is Wholly Different, But Not Less Good Large In Design, And Full Of Movement. Mr. Tonkss Picture Is A Nearly Lifesize Portrait Of A Lady Tending A Bird-Cage, And Is, Like All The Artists Pictures, A Dexterous And Attractive Harmony Of Gay Colours, Among Which A Bunch Of Brilliant Flowers Strikes The Dominant Note. Mr. Sargent Is Again An Exhibitor, With Some Sketches Done In Switzerland And North Italy A Mountain Landscape, The Moraine, And Two Rapidly-Painted Groups, The Fountain, With Portraits Of A Brother Artist And His Wife, And The Brook, With Two Girls Lying By The Side Of A Tumbling River. Masterly, Of Course And The Faces Charming But The Hand Which A Touch Would Alter Seems To Have Been Painted So That Those Who Have Denounced, The Hands In Every Sargent Picture Might Find Themselves Justified. Lastly, Let Us Mention Honoris Causa The Admirable Plain Of York, By Mr. W. W. Bussell The Late Spring Of Mr. Mark Fisher The Imaginative Vue De Moret Of Mr. A. Jamieson And The Stall Of Miss Clare Atwood. The Drawings Are Remarkable For Some Fresh Successes Of That Excellent Artist Mr. Muirhead Bone And Some Distressing Failures By Mr. A. E. John, Who Seems To Be Trying How Much The Patience Of His Admirers Will Stand. One Of The New Gatherings Of Which We Spoke Is The Society Of Country Painters, Which Has An Exhibition At Messrs. Tooths, 175, New Bond-Street. Country Should Mean West Country, For Most Of The Artists Are The Familiar Denizens Of Newlyn And St. Ives. It Is Almost Enough To Mention Their Namesmessrs. Frank Bramley And Arnesby Brown, Mr. T. C. Gotch And Mr. Moffat Lindner, Mr. Adrian Stokes And Mr. Tuke, With Some Recruits From Other Regions, Such As Mr. Francis James And James Paterson. The Visitor May Be Confident, Therefore, That He Will See The Work Of Some Very Accomplished Men, And That The Gallery Is Worth Visiting. Of Course, Too, The Exhibition Consists Of Sketches, Studies, And Small Finished Pictures And Drawings, Indicating That The Society Exists To Satisfy The Wish Of These Prominent Painters To Show What Could Not Well, Be Sent To The Academy. Mr. Gotch Is, Perhaps, The Chief Exhibitor, While Mr. Tuke Sends A Dozen Studies But The Best Things Here Are Two Delightful Child-Pictures By Mr. Bramley, Who, Except For One Important Picture, Has Appeared In Public Too Little Of Late Years. A Word Should Be Added In Praise Of Mr. Hugh Norriss Pleasant Series Of Landscapes In Water-Colour And Of Mr. Ayerst Ingrams Vigorous Little Pictures Of The Sea. The Grafton Galleries Are Filled With A Vast Assemblage Of The Works Of The United Arts Club The Same Club Which Last Week Was The. Victim Of An Adverse Decision By The Court Of Appeal. We Are Not Here Concerned With That Judgment, Except To Express Our Sympathy With A Number Of Innocent Artists On Whom The Law Has Pressed Heavily. The Club Has Now Moved To The Grafton, Where Over 400 Pictures, Drawings, And Other Works Of Art Are On Exhibition. It Need Not Be Said That The Effect Would Be Far Better If The Number Had Been Half As Large But Those Who Can Pick And Choose Will Find Much To Admire In The Sketches Of Mr. .Lavery, The Pictures Of Messrs. Coutts Michie, Leslie Thomson, Hughes-Stanton, And Glyn Philpot, The Beautiful Calligraphy Of Mr. Graily Hewitt, And The Printing Of The Eragny Press. Among Many Minor Shows One That Claims A Word Of Notice Is That Of The Work Of Mr. Austin Spare, At The Bruton Gallery, Bruton-Street. Mr. Spare Is Very Young, And Therefore Has Time To Learn. What He Should Learn, First And Foremost, Is That Ugliness Is A Poor Sort Of Ideal, And Aubrey Beardsley A Poor Sort Of Model. Among All These 114 Pen Drawings There Is Scarcely One That Reveals Any Desire To See And Draw Beautiful Things. Moreover, The Work Is Often As Careless As It Is Clever But It Is Clever Enough To Promise Considerable Things If Mr. Spare Will Only Be Wise In Time.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS167966052/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=d7fec878,,
(By Our Art Critic),The Royal Academy,The Times,1930-May-03,"London, England","The Royal Acadeivy I.-Pictures And The Public A Varied Exhibition Tlhe Annual Exhibition Of The Royal Academy Ioil Be Open To The Public On M1Londay. On Page 16 Is Given A First Se.Cction Of The Exhibits. By Our Art Critic Every Year It Is Necessary To Repeat That The Royal Academy Is An Institution With The Virtues And Defects Of The Kind. When Its Institutional Character Is Forgotteni, It Is An Open Question Wlhether The Royal Academy Suffers More Firom Its Friends Or Its Foes Frota Thlose Who Claim That It Adequately Represents Contemiiporary Art, Or From Those Who Deny That It Has Anything To Do Wvith Art Whatever. To Anybody. Who Regularly Frequents The Other Art Exhibitions Of The Year It Must Be Evident That The Claim Cannot Be Sustained That The Academy Has Very Little To Say To Contemporary Art In So Far As That Means The Ideas And Problems Which Are Exercising The Minds And The Talents Of The More Active Artists Of The Day But, To Anybody Whlo Goes Round Tile Academy Wvith An Unprejudiced Eye, It Is Equally Evident That A Good Deal Of Genuinie Art Finds Its Way Into Burlington House. A Moments Reflection Shows That In Wlhat It Does And Wlhat It Leaves Undone The Academy Does Not Differ From Any Other Institution. No Institution Keeps In Very Close Touch With Life In The Province That It Nominally Represents It Would Lose Its Character If It Did, Because An Institution Has A Life And Organization Of Its Own Irrespective Of Wvhat Is Going On In The World Outside. Nobody, For Instance, Would Atrgue That The Family Represents The Maximumn Of Available Friendship And Affection. On The Other Hand, No Institution Can Completely Ignore What It Nominally Represents, And Continue-And The Academy Goes On From Year To Year. As To The Gains And Losses To Art By The Continued Existence Of The Academy As An Institution There Is Much To Be Said On Both Sides. The Root Of The Question Is The Relatiotn Of The Acaderny To The Public. On That Point We Had Some Striking Evidence In The Popular Success Of The Italian Art Exhibition-For It Would Be Idle To Pretend That The Exhibition Attracted Half A Niillion People Entirely By Its Intrinsic Merits. Sometliing Wvas Due To The Fact That It Was Held At The Royal Academny. To A Certailn Oider Of Mind The Ideal Of An Unslhepherded Public In Close Contact Wvitlh Contemporary, Art Is Tempting, But Experience Shows That Thinlgs Do Not Happen That Way. When People Can Go To See Anything Anywhere They Dont. Thliv Need To Have It Given A Local Habitation And A Name. Academiy Art What It Amounts To, Then, Is That-Like Aiiy Other Institution-The Academy Makes Up As A Public Convenience For Wlhat It Neglects In Contemporary Art. There Is No Reason Whatever To Suppose Hat The General Public Would Get Inlto Closer Contact Witlh Contemporary Art If The Academy Wvere Abolished. Going To Churchl Is Not The Whole Of Religion-But We Knowv All About The Tman Who Goes To Chlurchl In Tle Greeon Lields. What The Academy Represents Is, Roughly, What The Great Majority Of People Niean By Art-Which Is Not Necessarily Nearer To The Hteart Of Thc Subject Than What They Nlican By Literature Or The Dralma. It, Wvouldl Not Be Safo To Call It Academic Art, Becaziso The Wvord Is In Dispute But Acadeniy Aiit, With Its Implicaitioni Of Alaptation To The Tastc Of The Majority Wvho Find Burlingilton House An Aniual Convenience, Is A Fair Enoughi Description. Some Such Preliminary Is Necessairy To A Just General Estiiiate Of The Present Exhibition. It Is Oven Less In Touch Withl Contemporary Art Than Have Been Those Of Recent Years, But It Is Rather Better Than Usual, And Much More Varied In Effect, On Its Own Lines. Taken As A Whole, It Emphasizes The Institutional Character Of The Academy And Cultivates Its Peculiar Resources. From Wahat Has Been Said It Almost Follows That There Are Rmore Oil Paintings Than Last Year65 To Be Precise-Or The Year Before, Because The Typical Academy Picture Is The Oil Painting. The Quotation In The Catalogue Is From The Late Poet Laureate With New Attainmnent New Orders Of Beauty Arise. Fromi Wlhat We See Around Us Tlhis Can Only Be Interpreted As Meaning That Newv Beauties Are Seei When Beautiful Subjects Or Objects Are More Perfeotly Represented Or Arranged In A New Order. With The Order Of Beauty Which Arises Fjoni The Play Of Forlmis Or Colours In Tho Abstract Tho Academiiy Has Little Concern. Distinguishing Fe.Xtur.Es As Last Year, Gallery Vi. Is Devroted To Drawvings, Engravings, And Etchings, In Wvlichl The Tehlnical Standard, At Least, Is Consistently Higl, And Water-Colour Overflows-Largely In The Form Of Tetupera, Whlich, If Nlemory Can Be Trusted, Is Officially Recognized For The First Time-Into The Smaller Of The South Rooms. The Maost Startling Incidert In The Exhibition Is A Watercolour By Mr. P. Wilson Steer-Not Sent In By The Artist But Bought By The President And Council Under The Terms Of The Chantry Bequest In One Of Their Excursions Inito Contemilporary Art. This Alone Xwould Distinguish Lll Academy Of 1930, But In Addition Tlhere Is An Cxhibit, Of Plate For Delhi, By The Goldsmitlhs Company, Which Is Surely Tho Thin End Of The Wedge Of Applied Art. Tho Placo Of Honour In The Big Roomii Is Held By A Landscape, The Valley Of The Var, France Sunrise, By Sir H. Hughesstanton, R.A., And The Problem Of Liow Best To Colour The Walls Of The Big Room Is Still Unresolved. At Present They Are Of Tho Samre Sullen Purplish Terra-Cotta Wvhicli Menaced The Florentines In The Italian Art Exhibition. Tlho Best Colour For All Purposes Is Admittedly Difficult To Decide, But Going By The Look Of The First Room One Wvould Say That Something Between Its Grey And The Biscuit Of The Frieze In The Big Room Should Serve. Except On A Small Scale, In Groups, There Is Only One Royal Portrait, Her Mlajesty The Queen, By Mr. David Jagger-Three-Quarter Length, Seated, In A White Satin Evening Dress And Fur-Collared Cloak Of Royal Blue-And It Is Interesting For Several Reasons. In The First Placo It Is Obviously An Unofficial Portrait, And So Suggests A Particular Graciousness, And In The Second Place It Presents A More Credible Likeness Than Almost Any Royal Portrait We Have Ever Seen. What It Suggests Is The Pictorial Record Of One Of Those Endearing And Unrehealrsed Contacts Between Sovereign And Subject That Wve Read About When The King Or The Queen Goes Visiting Among Their People. This Is Said With The Greater Satisfaction Becauso Mlr. Jaggers Style Of Painting, His Rather Slick Rendering Of Surfaces And Textures, Is Not Very Much To Our Liking. He Is Certainly To Be Congratulated On The Use He Has Made Of This Opportunity. There Are Several Pictures Of The Problem Kind, And The Happiest Is The Chess Playerstwo Little Girls On The Floor Of A Gaily Furniished Room, With Sunlight Striking Across-By Sir John Lavery, R.A. Particularly In Colour, It Leans Too Heavily Upon Assorted Facts To Bo Called A Great Work Of Art, But It Is A Very Ingenious Composition In Perspective, Andl, Taken Together With His Ecellent Poritrait Of Time Lord Mclchett, So Firmly Constructed And Solidly Realized As To Be Lot Iiiimiiediately Recognized As Hiis, It Himspires A New Interest In T He Artist. Twvo Of Tho Other Probleni Pictuires Afford A Useful Illtustration Of How This Kind Of Thing Ought To Be Done. Were Yott Theret Ihiea They Crucified My Lord ? By Mr. Mark Syiunns-A Sort Of Closely Packed Pre-Raphaelite Version Of A Pieter Brueghel The Elder Motive, Representing All Vypes And Orders Of Humanity At The Crucifixion-Dbes Not Really Set Out To Be A Painting, But A Picture To Be Read And Therefore It Is Accepted Xwith All Its Discrepancies. You Do Not Really See The Picture, But Through It To The Story. Destructive Allegory Ho-Mo Sapiens, By Mr. John Keating -Represcnting A Spectacled Rnan Bearing A Rifle, Gas Mask, Bishops Mitre, And Judges Iwig, Before A Background Of Skyscrapers And Aircraft, And, Presumably, Intended To Expose The Follies Of A Mechanical Civilization-On The Other Hand, Does Set Out To Be A Painting, Is, In Fact, By An Hrtist Wvho Can Paint Very Vell Realistically. Thle Result Is That You Do Not Accept The Allegory. The Realism Of The Representation Brings Out The Discrepancy Of The. Facts. Nor Is The Allegory True Man May Be A Fool, But Lie Does Not Build Skyscrapers So Close Together As That. The Moral Is That, Contrary To General Belief, You Cannot Both Paint A Picture And Tell A Story. Mlany Of The Academy Exlhibitors Do Not Try To Paint A Picture, But Before Coming To Their Works-Often Admirable On Their Own Lines-It May Be Wvell To Uiame A Few Things Of Outstanding Merit, For Artistic And Human Reasons Combined Sir Gerald Du Mlaurier, By Mir. A,Tigustus John, R.A., Is Probably The Firtlst Oil Painting In The Whole Exhibiticn. It Is Rather Grubby In Colour, But This, And An Effect Of -Worry In The Handling, Only Intensify The Impression That The Artist Has Completely Lost Himself In His Conception Of The Subject. The Head Being Placed Higah, The Clasped Hands Are Properly Left Unfinished. Othervise They Would Make A Second Focus. Altogether Mr. Jolins Work This Year Is Remarkable For The Way In Which It Puts Grip Of The Subject Before Facility. Portrait Of A Young Man -One Of The Several Diploma Works Which Lend Circunistantial Interest To The Exhibition, Is A Fine Head And Earl Spencer, Viscount Althorp, K.G., G.C.V.O.. Though, At A Glance And Near To, It Strikes One As Rather Comic, Is Seen At The Proper Distance To Be A Very Dashing Military Portrait, Naking Its Effect Bv Arrangement, And Having A Splendid Foil To Scarlet In The Dark Blue Background. The Work By Mr. John Wlhichl Is Niost Likely To Be Argued About Is His Portrait Of Miss Tallulah Bankhead In The First Room. In Form It Is A Narrowish Upright, With The Lady In Pink, Wvith Lightly Crossed Hands, Against A Grey-Blue Background. It Is Definitely Fantastic, With Suggetions Of Both Rossetti And Albert Moore, But It Springs Like A Flower Out Of An Intense Reaction To An Inter.-Sting Personality. Two Other P9,?Traits Claim Attention. The First Is Rthe Late Dame Miillicent Fas Cett.. U.B.E., Ll.D., By Mirs. Annie L. Swynnerton, A.R.A., Which Nmakes A Devastating Comparison With Milss H. M,. Wvhite, Ll.D., Principal, 4Lxander College, Dublin, By Sir Wivilliam Orpen, R.A. There Can Be No Question Whichl Is The Cleverer Of The Two, But Wvhereas Sir William Orpen Puts You Off With A Brilliant Rendering Of Externals, Mrs. Swynnerton Presents You To A Real Human Being. The Titles Of The Twvo Subjects Niake The Coniparison All The Morc Pointed. Tlhe Other Portrait Is 2Miss Lidgett, By Mr. Francis Dodd, A.R.A. It Is Chosen Because It Showvs Very Wvell The Kind Of Portraiture That English Artists-Since They Lost The Decorative Swving Of The Eighteenth Century-Attempt Most Successfully. As A Picture-Though The Colour Scheme Is Pleasing-It Has No Great Merit, The Figure Having No Depth, But From The Point Of View Of Character And Facial Expression, Particularly In The Eyes, The Painting Of The Bead Is A Wonder.

Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1932-Nov-25,"London, England","Entertainments Art Exhibitions The Von Auspitz Collection The Von Auspitz Collection Of Old Nasters, Exhibited At Agnews Galleries, 43, Old Bond Street, Is An Amusing, Ingenious, And Sophisticated Collection Which Admirably Reflects A Modern Taste In Old Masters. Where A Picture Is Not Precisely A Good One, It Is Usually Entertaining, And It Is Obvious That The Collector Has Not Been Oppressed By Great Names. Italian Paintings Predominate, Althouglh The Finest Works Of Art Are From Other Schools. Thus There Are A Small Sketch Of A Head By Rembrandt, A Large Landscape By Ruisdael In Which The Painter Has Frankly Accepted And Made A Most Interesting Harmony Of The Most Difficult Greens And Reds, A Goya Portrait Which Is That Rare Thing, A Solid Work With Exquisitely Pretty Colour, An Impressive Portrait Of An Old Lady By Memling, And An Interesting Portrait By El Greco, More Remarkable, Perhaps, In Its Colour Than In The Modelling, Among The Italian Paintings The Most Unexpected Is A Little Nativity By The Piedmontese Painter Defendente Ferrari. One Would Hardly Have Supposed From His Large Altarpieces, With An Awkward Mixture Of High Renaissance Chiaroscuro And More Primitive And Papery Forms, That This Painter Could Have Achieved So Elaborate A Definition Of Space And So Complete A System Of Romantic Lighting. It Is One Of Those Pictures Which Introduce One Into A Fantastic World Which Yet Appears To Have Its Own Consistency. Foppa, It May Be Remembered, Has Sometimes This Same Gift, But Here, In An Interesting Example Of His Work, A Saint Sebastian, He Has Rather Inconsistently Introduced A Leonardesque Figure Into A Romantic Landscape Composed In His More Usual Manner. It Must, Therefore, Be A Very Latc Work. There Are Several Curious Works Of The Ferrarese School, Of Which The Best Is A Remarkable Small Figure Of St. Anthony Abbot By Ercole Roberti, And The Oddest An Adoration Of Thc Magi, In Which The Virgin, It Is Interesting To Note. Must Have Been Copied Directly From A Flemish Picturc Or Drawing. It Is Not A Question Of The Usual Influence This Is A Complete Copy. The Attribution To Galasso Galassi Must Be Rather Speculative, Since Only One Work Doubtfully-By This Painter, Celebrated In His Time, Now Exists, And That Is Quite Different. Perhaps One Might Think Of Parentino As An Alternative. To Turn To More Imposing Works, There Are Two Largc Decorations By Tiepolo, A Very Sound Portrait By Moroni, And A Pleasing If Rather Hard Landscape By Canaletto S Nephew, Bellotto, Painted On His German Tour. A Small Deposition By Benozzo Gozzoli, With An Interesting Hint Of Castagno In The Landscape, A Pretty Prcdella By Matteo Di Giovanni, And Two Angels Making Music By The Maestro Del Bambino Vispo Should Also Be Noticed.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS201926521/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=1f35d0bc,,

In The Taq-I-Bostan Reliefs, As Well As A Silk Panel, Almost Equally Rare, Attributed To The Seljuk Period. Silk Bocades Of The Late Sixteenth Century, With Figure Subjects, And Robes And Coats Of Coloured Figure Brocade Of The Seventeenth And Early Eighteenth Centiuries Have Also Been Chosen. A Large Dark Blue Satin Portiere Of The Late Sixteenth Century, Brocaded With Palmettes, Butterflies, And Wisps Of Cloud,In Coloured Silks And Silver And Silver-Gilt Thread, Is To Be Temi. Porarily Transferred To The Academy.

Mawes, Cornwall. These Things, However, By No Means Exhaust The List Of Accomplished, Or.Otherwise Interesting, Oil Paintings-Nor Even Of Those In The Big Gallery. There Are A Large Number Of Artists For Example, Who Show Their Skill In Still Life And Flower Painting. In Still Life There Are The Studio Table V-Rather Sand-,Papered In Style, If One May Put It So-Of Mr. James Gunn, And Other Good Things By Mr. Adrian Hill Mr. Cowan Dobson, Mr. Will C. Penn, And Mrs. Helen Bedford, While The Flower Paintings Include The Luscious, But-Yet Rather Cold, Virtuosity Of Mr. H. Davis Richter,F The Attractive Colour And Comparatively Loose Drawing Of Mr. Rowland Suddaby, The Soft But Rich Hues And Broad Touch Of Miss Irene Ryland, And Pleasant-Things By Mr. Francis Dodd, Mrs. Evelyni Clutton-Brock, And Miss Grace English-To Name Only A Few. ,Architectural Painting, -Which Is In A Way Allied. To Still Life, Is Represented By Several Examples Which Are Not Only Decorative But Of Much Topographical Interest. Among Them Are Mr. John Coles Admirable No. 70, Park Road, N.W. An Enlarged Version, If Memdry Is Not At Fault, Of A Subject He Has Previously Painted On A Smaller Scale, Mr. Harold Workmans The Arches, Villiers Street, And The Soho Corner Of- Mr. Edward Le Bas, Who Seems, In This Picture, To Be Going Back To The Tradition Of The Camden Town Group.- - Pleasant Landscapes Though Landscape Is Not The Strongest Feature Of This Exhibition, There Arc Nevertheless -As Iri Almost Every Collectioh Of English Pictures-Some Good Things Of The Kind. Many Of Them, However, Are Comparatively Small, Like Sir Walter Russells Altogether Charming Studland Deach, With Its Bright Bathing Tents Outlined Against A Darkl Green Line Of Trees Coming Down To The Shore. Mr. Lucien Pissarros Thistle-Grown Field In France Mr. Philip Connards Little Sutton Farm, Miss Constance Bradshaws A Welsh Estuary And Miss Elsie Fews Delicately Gay And Pretty Little Eywood House With. Things By Mr. Sydneylee Mr. P. H. Padwick, Miss Ethel Gabain, Mr. William Hoggatt, Mr. John Copley, And Others, Also Linger Pleasantly In The Memory. So, Too, In Other Kinds, Do Mr. Claude Rogerss Small Head Of A Woman, Very Solid And Full Of Character, In Spite Of Its Comparative Lack Of Definition And Of A Rather Disturbing Shadow On One Cheek Mr. C. Maresco Pearces Lively Little Conversation Piece. No. 13, Bedford Square Mr. Ethelbert Whites Peace In Kensington Gardens, A Picture Of Londoners Taking Tea Under Gaily Coloured Umbrellas Which Showvs A Change Of Style, Both In Subject And Colour, From His Usual Work Mr. A. K. Lawrences Large Nude Standing Among Rocks And, By Way Of Contrast To The Last, Mr. Ruskin Spears Sombre Little Nude Study. The English Standard Is So High In Watercolour That A Critic Isapt To Be Exacting In Considering It, And Certainly There Are A Good Many Essentially Trivial Things In The Watercolour Rooms At Burlington House. But There Are Some Good Things Too, Such As Mr. George Grahams Green And Grey Drawing Of Rain, Falling On To The Fells Out Of A Leaden Sky, Mr. E. Boye Udens. Excellent Architectural Burgate Street, Canterbury, And Mr. Martin Hardies Windy Sky With Birch Trees Bent Across It. Mr. E. A. Sallis Benneys Blue Monochrome Of Kings College Chapel, Cambridge, Is Also A Sound Work. Mr. Robin G.Uthries Pen And Wash Drawing Of A Girl, Dinette, Is Lively And Nervous And Mr. Tan Strangs Tree Group. Buckinghamshire Shows Once More With What Riclness As Well As Detail This Artist Drawvs Landscape In Black Chalk. Therc Are Convincing Portrait Drawings Of Miss Dorothy L. Sayers By Pigalle, And Of Dr. Malcolm Sargent By Mr. Russell Reeve. Engravings And Sculpture Of The Engravings It Is Here Possible To Say No More Than That They Include Dry-Points By Sir Muirhead Bone And Mr. Malcolm Osborne, And Wood Engravings By Mr. C. W. Taylor And Almost As Perfunctory Treatment Must Be Given To The Sculpture. A Special Word, However, Must Be Spared For Mr. Charles Wheelers Head-Grave And Slightly Stylized Syrinx, In Polished Lead, And To Another Heat In The Same Medium, Mr. George Ehlichs Restrainedly Tragic Dumb Girl. The Exhibition Does Not Cover The Whole Of Contemp6Rary Art. The More Advanced Schools Are Hardly Represented-Though There Are Contributions By Miss Eileen Agar And Mr.,Ceri Richards-And Such Painters As Mr. Ivon Hitchens, Though Present, Are Not Seen At Their Best. Even Amorig The Academic Painters Some Eminent Figures Are Absent. Yet There Is Much That Is Attractive Among The Exhibits And, Since The Walls Afe Not Overcrowded, They Arc Seen To Advantage. To The Royal Academy, And To The Exhibiting Artists The Thanks Or Thc Public Are Certainly Due And, As The Cause Which Has The Patronage Of The King And Quteen Is Excellent, It Is Greatly To Bc Hoped That Thc Exhibition Will Meet With An Encouraging Reception And Brisk Sales. .

Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1950-Oct-21,"London, England","Art Exhibitions Mr. Clifford Hat.. Mr. Clifford Halls Oil Paintings At Roland, Browse And Delbancos Gallery, 19, Cork Street, Include A Number Of The Small Paintings In Which He Always Seems Most At Ease, But Also Some Larger Works In Whih He Has Worked Very Methodically And With An Admirably Serious Approach. His Technique And Style Derive From Sickert But His Larger Designs Are Usually Stiffer And More Geometrical Than Those Of The Master He Uses His Medium With A Certain Austerity And Concentrates On Form Construction And A Strictly Calculated Design. Place De Lodeon Is Perhaps The Most Successful And The Most Completely Realized Of His Landscapes In Some Of His Other Works May Be Seen The Defects Of His Qualities, A Certain Aridity And The Absence Of Any Spontaneous Response To His Subject. In Mr. Leslie Hurrys Watercolour Drawings At The Same Gallery Modem Surreahsm Is Combined With An Imitation Of The More Preposterous Inventions Of English Painters Of The Romantic Revival. Perhaps The Strangest Mixture Is In Industrial Family, Where Mechanized Figures Appear Against A Background Of Strawberry Hill Gothic. His Theatre Designs For Kcing Lear And Medea Are Less Whimsical And More Portentous. Jankel Adler An Exhibition Of His Watercolours, Gouaches And Drawings In Various Mediums At Gimpel Fils Gallery, 50, South Molton Street, Makes A Good Introduction To The Art Of Jankel Adler. In Oil Painting His Touch Was Sometimes Heavy And He Had, Moreover, A Tendency To Use Overelaborate Concoctions Of Paint In His Effort To Enrich The Surface Of His Pictures. But In Watercolour There Are No Such Obstacles To Prevent Appreciation Of His Remarkable Fertility Of Invention, His Power Of Giving Vitality To The Most Extravagantly Distorted Forms, And The Natural Breadth Of His Design. His Art Was Based On That Of Picasso, And Adler Made No Very Radical Changes In The Idiom He Borrowed, But He Used It With Complete Freedom And As An Appropriate Expression Of His Own Quite Individual Imagination His People Are Never Picassos And Their Expressions Are Very Different Even When Their Bodies Are Constructed In Much The Same Way. It Was For This Reason, No Doubt, That He Had Such A Marked Influence On A Number Of English Artists Just After The War Through Adler The Young Painter Was Introduced, Not So Much To Picasso Himself, As To The Possibility Of Using What Was By Then A Familiar Mode Of Distortion, In Themes Of His -Own Choosing Rather Than In A Mere Variation On Picassos Own Themes. Marine Arnsts The Fifth Annual Exhibition Of The Society Of Marine Artists, At Guildhall, Is Largely Dominated By Paintings, Of Which The Shipyard By Mr. Norman Wilkinson And Glamorous Night By Mr. Charles Pears May Be Taken As Good And Characteristic Examples, In Which The Artists Style Has Clearly Been Affected By The Requirements Of Modem Methods Of Reproduction. As Firm Outlines And Sharp Contrasts Come Out Best, This Certainly Makes For Clarity Of Design, But Also, In The Attempt To Render The Multiplicity Of Waves And Ripples With A Perfectly Clear Definition Of Every Contour, For The Use Of Rather Rigid Formulas. Mr. Pearss Black And White Sea, With The Sparkle Of Reflected Light Indicated By A Multitude Of Neat Dots, Is An Extremely Ingenious Instance Of The Use Of A Device Which Would Be More Justifiable In A Poster, For Example, Than In A Painting. But There Are Also A Number Of Workswhich Are Painted With A Freer Finish And More Interest In The Actual Quality Of Oil Paint Among These May Be Noticed Mr. Leslie Kents The Foreshore And Mr. P. Maurice Hills Attractive Little Interior, Marine Only In The View Through The Door And Window, The Toll-Bar Cafd, Fowey. Among The Watercolours May Be Noticed Mr. John Worsleys Sensitive View Of Portsmouth Harbour, Mr. S. E. Becks Modest Little Study Making Smoke, And Some Accomplished Paintings By Mr. Martin Hardie.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS135613269/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=0f468940,,

M. Gross, An Austrian Artist Whose Work Has Often Been Shown On The Continent. He Is An Architect As Well As Painter, But There Is None Of The Usual Tight Construction Of The Architect In His Pictures On The Contrary, His Drawing Is Free And Rhythmical And His Paint Is Usually Varied And Opulent, Sometimes With A Jewelled Brilliance Of Colour. His Largest Painting, Girl With Fruitbowl, Has A Most Luxurious Appearance And With All Its Sparkle And Glitter There Is A Firm And Well Sustained Design, Though The Modeleng Of The Head Is Perhaps A Little Too Linear To Agree With The More Ornamental Passages Elsewhere In The Picture. His Smaller Compositions, In Oil On Paper, Pastel, Or Gouache, Are Agreeably Light And Delcate In Touch And Im Several, Particularly The Audience And Refugee Children, There Is Some Sharp Observation Of Character.

If The Numbers Could, Be Reduced By About Onehalf, The Exhibition Of The Society Of Portrait Painters At The New Gallery Would Be A Very Good One Bub Ib Is Not Possible To Fill Three Large Rooms With Fine Portraits, Even Though A Few Should Not Be The Work Of The Present Year. Nearly All The Oil Pictures In The South Room Might Well Be Spared. But Not The Drawings, For These Include Some Of The Best Things Here, Especially Those Of Professor Legros, Mr. William Strang, And Mr. C, H. Shannon. For The Rest, All That Need Be Mentioned Are Mr. Richard Jacks Full-Length Portrait Of A Small Boy In Brown Clothes And A Red. Tam-O-Shanter Cap 122, Mr. Hugh Rivieres Lady Heygate, And .Mrs. Joplings Head Of A Gallant Young Corporal In The Imperial Yeomanry. We Come To A Higher Average Of Work When We Enter The West Room. Here Are Some Portraits Painted Many Years Ago, Such As The Well-Known Ford Madox Brown, By Himself, And A Small Half-Length Of A Frenchman, The Excellent Work Of Ribot Before He Fell Into His Disastrous Imitation Of The Black Masters. If Mr. Whistler Is To Keep His Hold, Even Of Those Who Sincerely Admire His Work, He Must Show Something Better Than Green And. Gold. 5 But, On The Other Hand, M. Blanche Cannot Fail To Conquer The Applause Of Those Who Until Now Have Known Only His Pastel Drawings By Such A Completely Successful Picture As His Arthur Symons, Esq. 9. Few Portraits Here Are So Completely Realized Few Are So Masterly In Technique. Mr. Hugh Glazebrcoks Miss Lilias Walker 17 Is A Success And Deserves Its Conspicuous Position Mr. John Colliers Joyce 26 Is A Charming And Evidently Truthful Portrait Of A Very Young Girl Mr. E. A. Waltons Dr. Dey Is A Powerful Picture, Which Will -Improve With Time And Mr. J. H. Lorimers Sir John Scott, K.C.M.G. 33, Is A Clever Likeness Of A Remarkable Man, Though We Confess To A Prejudice Against The Artists Fondness For Highly-Polished Surfaces. Child Portraits By Mr. Llewellyn 34 And Mr. George Henry 39 Lead Us On To Mr. Guthries Very Distinguished Picture Of The Late Alexander Osborne, D.L. 48, A Work Planned With Much Dignity, But Unfortunately Tending To Blackness In The Flesh Tints. Mr. Richard Jacks Mrs. Donald Smith 52 Shows Us This Painter Coming As Near To Mr. Sargent As Any Follower Is Likely To Come A Capital Picture In Every Way, Did It Not Suggest Somewhat Too Closely Another Painters Style. The Same Objection May Be Brought Against The Beautiful Work By Mr. C. H. Shannon, The Circular Group Called The Bunch Of Grapes 32. It Is A Fine Thing Both, In Design And In Colour, But It Inevitably Recalls The Pictures That Mr. Watts Used To Paint Some Thirty Or Forty Years Ago. In The North Room There Is Not So Much That Is Excellent. The Most Popular Picture Will He Mr. Heywood Hardys The Zetland Hunt, A Crowd Of Riders And Hounds With Aske For A Background But The Most Important Pictures From The Point Of View Of Art Are The Study By Mr. Watts 87 And The E. Davis, Esq., By Mr. Orchardson 83, Though The Latter Has Never Been Ranked Among The Best Of The Artists Pictures. Mr. A. Stuart Wortley, The President Of The Society, Shows A Carefully-Painted Portrait Of Lord Kinnoull 66, And The Contributions Of Mr. Collier, Mr. Blake Wirgman, And Mr. Lorimer Are Worthy Of Note. With The Portraits Are Shown The Works Of The Society Of Miniature Painters, Who For The Moment Have Migrated Here From Bond-Street. The Light Yesterday Was So Bad That We Could Not Prptend To Judge Them Properly, But It Seems To Be An Attractive Exhibition. Most Of The Wellknown Members, Such As Mr. Alyn Williams, Mr. And Mrs. Lee Hankey, Mr. Dudley Hardy, Mme. Debillemont-Chardon, And Many Other Ladies Are Well Represented. The Exhibition Of The New English Art Club At The Dudley Gallery Is Of Not More Than Average Interest Indeed, It Suggests Once More, And Rather Painfully, The Question Whether Anything Is To Come Of A Movement Which Has Promised For Ten Years And Has Not Come To Performance. The Best Thing Here Is Undoubtedly Mr. C. W. Purses Lord Roberts But This Is Avowedly A Sketch, And The Finished Picture Was Exhibited, Several Years Ago At The Academy. It Is A Brilliant Thing And. A Great Contrast To The Majority Of Equestrian Portraits, In Which Wooden Men Are Mounted On Immovable Horses. Mr. W. W. Russell, Mr. James Henry, And. Professor Fred. Brown Once More Show A Charming Gift For Landscape Mr. Conder Paints Rough First Sketches Of Watteaus, But Gives Us No Chance Of Judging Whether He Possesses Anything Of Watteaus Delicacy Of Hand. Mr. W. Orpen Has A Good Seated Portrait, Rather Too Black 119, And A Still Better Figure Subject Which He Calls The Mirror Close To This Latter Are Mr. Bernhard Sickerts Very Clever Chiswick Mall And. The Interesting Little Picture The Escaped. Bird, By Mr. Henry Tonks. The Water-Colours Include Characteristic Drawings By Mr. Brabazon, Mr. Francis James, Mr. V. 8. Mccoll, Mr. E. E. Fry, And Other Well-Known Exhibitors. Of Minor Exhibitions And. One-Man Shows There Are So Many That We Cannot Pretend Even To Name Them All. Bond-Street Teems With Them. Messrs. Forbes And. Paterson Have Yet Another Display Of The Colour-Dreams Of Monti.Cell!, Whom, I In Spite Of All Temptations, The Lovers Even Of The Most Modern Art Cannot Quite Bring Themselves To Regard, As A Great Man. Great Or Not, However, Tins Little Gallery Contains The Best He Could, Do. At Messrs. Dowdeswells, Mr. Oliver Hall Proves With The Brush, What He Has Often Proved, With The Etching Needle, That He Has A Real Gift For Landscape, Though We Are Not Sure That He Quite Realizes The Variety Of Colour Possessed By The Landscapes Of Southern England. Mr. Finn, At The Modern Gallery, Once More Shows Clever Drawings Of Cathedrals, This Time Choosing Lincoln, And Ely. It Is Impossible To Praise The Extremely Artificial Beauties In Mr. Herbert Schmaltzs Dream Of Fair Women At The Fine Art Societys Gallery But In The Adjoining Room Are A Number Of Those Beautiful Visions Jjof Mr. Albert Goodwins, Of Which It Is Scarcely Possible To Have Too Many. Lastly, If -We May Pass From Bond-Street To The Neighbourhood. Of Christies, And. From The New To The Older Art, We Find, A Number Of Interesting Pictures At Messrs. Shepherds, Who Still Strive Manfully To Present The Public With Good, Works Of This Class, In Spite Of The Increasing Difficulty Of Finding Them. A Portrait Of The Wife Of William Collins, I?. A., By Mrs. Carpenter, Shows That The Celebrity Which That Lady Enjoyed As A Portrait Painter Was Not Undeserved And. A Few Genuine Works By John Russell, Gainsborough, And Opie A Lamplight Scenetogether With Some Good Old.

In Relation To Industrial Potting -The Pieces At The Paterson Gallerystand For Pure Artistic Research-As Necessary In Its Way As Pure Scientific Reserh.

A Large Proportion Of The Paintingsand Drawings By Mr. Mariano Andrea Who Was Born At Bareelona In 1888 At The Claridge Gallery, 52, Brook-Street, Are Of Musical Subjects, And There Is More In The Circumstance Than Sentimental Preference Would Explain. The Truth Is That Mr. Andreul Is Strongly Musical In His Pictorial Inclination, Putting The Emphasis Upon Melody Of Lne. He Is, Fineed, A Very Skilful Composer, Able To Bring Human And Inanimate Forns-As Of Cellos And Pianos-Into Relationship So That They Make A Unified Design, And Wvhat Waes The Skill Au The More Remarkable Is That The Forms Are Sharply Delineated And Modelled In Relief With A Good Deal Of Gradation. Groupe Musicale, Of Ladies With Various Instruments Round A Piano, And Matin, A Group -Of Figures, Also With A Musical Reference, In Landscape, Are Delightful Compositions From The Point Of View Of Entertaining The Eye. Beyond That Mr. Andreii Does Not Go Very Deep His Work Is Curiously Remote From Psychological Interest-Though Deux Femmes Jouant Aux Eartes, With The Ace Of Hearts In Play, Hss An Emotional Su Lestiveness But-He Is A Very Accomplishe Mrftran, Particularly In Pencil.

Mr. James Gunn, Who Exhibits Ortraits And Landscapes At The Qolnaghi Ries. 144, New Bond-Street, Wins Respect And Gives Pleasure By Considered Refinement Of Workmanship In A Vein Of Simphfied Realism.

Self-Portrait Is Practically A Study In Greys, Running Through The Whole Scale From Almost Hiit Wsiifst-Hlackthefleslitins-Heing Subdued Into Harmony With Them And The Pater Naade By The Greys, Apart From Their Representative Function, Gives A Good Idea Of Mr. Gunns Talent As A Composer.

She Could, Apparently, Do Nothing By Rule, But Sho Had Imagination, Wit And Humour, Keen Sensibility, A Natural Instinct For Design, A Fine Sense Of Colour, .And, At Any Rate In Water-Colour, Full Confidence In The Medium. There Is Batdly A Picture Or Sketch In The Exhibition Of 179 Items Which Does Not Give The Impression Of Whole-Hearted Enjoyment. Mirs.

In Such Flower Paintings As White Flower Group And Flower Piece, Lent By Mrs. Asquith, And Ivory And Grey, Loosely Composed, But In Perfect Balance, Nith No Great Concern For Depth, The Natural Susceptibility To The Emotional Appeal Of Form, As Well As Of Colour, Is Unmistakable. They Get By A Sort Of Rhythmical Instinct What Many Others Attempt By Theory. Market Day, 3Iontreuil, And The Old Curiosity Hop, An -Interior, Show How The Same Instinct Rather Than Science Enabled Mrs. Downe To Bring Much Detail Into Unity It Is The Underlying Tone, So To Speak, Which Holds The Pictures Together. The Freakish Humour Which First Attracted Notice To Mrs. Dovne Is Shown In D For Donkey Having A Lark And Holding Up The Traffic And Amiong The Landscapes, From The Miorridge, North Staffordshire, And Stormelouds, Bosham, May Be Specially Noted.

He Thought, Probably, That The Educational Object Of The Design Would Best Be Served In This Way, And That The Public Had No Need Of Any Other Gathering Together Of Contemporary Pictures Than The Annual Exhibitions, Metropolitan And Provincial On This Point The Manchester Projectors Differed From His Royal Highness, And, We Venture To Think, Wisely. Neither Ancient Nor Modern Art Can Be Thoroughly Appreciated Apart. Enthusiastic Devotion To Either, And Il-Judged Contemptfor Either, May Readily Be Engendered By Exclusive Study Of One Or Ofthe Other But Appreciation Isonlypossible To Those Who, Holding In Check Their Own Tendencies, And Studiously Estimating The Objects, Advantages, Conditions, And Applications Under And For Which The Ancient And The Modern Painter Worled, Will Be Content To Study The Art Of Every Century, From The 13Th To The 19Th. Opportunities Of Doing This By Help Of Anything Like A Complete And Systematically Arranged Series Of Examples Are So Rare That We Rejoice That The Planners Of The Manchester Lxhibition Did Not Let Slip The Chance Of Adding This, The Best And Fullest, To The Number. There Is No Other Country In The World Where It Is So Possible To Gather Within The Countrys Own Borders The Means Of Effecting This Completely, And That, Too Without Trenching On Public Galeries And National Collections. With The Exception Of Some Examples Of The Ceramic Art From The British Museum And The Department Of Science And Art, And Of Some Arms And Armour From The Tower, Everything Here Exhibited Comes From The Galleries Of The Sovereign, Or From The Collections In Private Houses. British Individualism Is Impressed On This As On Every Other Manifestation Of British Mind, And Along With This That Feature Which, Individual As We Are, Links Us More Closely In Nationality Than Any Other People,-British Public Spirit. The Work Has Been Planned For Objects Nothing Less Than National. The Owners Of The Rarest Pictures And Miniatures, Of The Most Fragile Treasures In Glass, Porcelain, And Pottery, Of The Most Precious Works In Gems And Gold And Silver, Of The Most Curious Specimens Of Cabinetwork, Of Engravings And Etchings, Unique And Almost Priceless, Have Not Secrupled, For A National Object, To Expose Their Treasures To The Dangers Of Packing And Transport, The Rislk Of Thieves And Fire, And The Thousand Hazards Of A Crowded Exhibition-Room. For Works Of Which The Money-Value May Be Reckoned In Millions, The Owners Have Only Required The Protection Of In. Surance To The Amount Of Less Than 200,0001. Where Contributions Have Been Refused It Has Been In The Vast Majority Of Cases, Not From Indisposition To Contribute, But From The Strict Stipulations In Family Settlements Forbidding The Transfer Of Heirlooms From The Galleries Where They Are Hung. And Thus Many Of The Noblest Tributes To Devotion, Of The Most Gorgeous Appliances Of Wealth And Civilization And Of The Most Artistic Ministrations To The Refinements Of Life, Have Found Their Way To Smoky, Sooty, Steamy Manchester And For Its Toiling Crowds, Within Hearing Of Its Never-Ceasing Dia Andwhirl Of Wheels, Under The Canopy Of Its Black Cloud From Innumerable Chimneys, Arises A Temple Dedicated Tothe Beautiful. It Was A Noble Duke, And Not Amanchester Cottonspinner, -Who Asked The Question, When Applied To For Some Of His Pictures, What In The World Has Manchester To Do With Art I Manchester Has To Do With Art, If Only Because It Is Condemned To The Most Continuous And Unlovely Forms Of Labour. It Has To Do With Art Because Art Is A Potent Means Of Education And Refinement And Without These Manchester Cannot Continue To Prosper, Morally Or Materially. It Has To Do With Art, Finally, Because Mianchester Is The Great Centre Of The Manufacturing District Of The North, And Art Is The Foundation Of Design, And Design Is Of The Essence Of Successful Manufactures. Before Entering Upon A Detailed Consideration Of The Works Here Exhibited, We Would Offer A Few Suggestions To The Committee With Reference To The Means By Which Their Undertaking May Be Made Most Conducive To Its Best Objects. The Sooner Some Plan Is Devised For Admitting The Working Tbousands To Their Exhibition The Better. Manchester Is One Of The Few Seats Of In- Dustry In Which A Saturday Half-Holyday Is The Rule N All Establishments. Let The Exhibition, Then, Be Opened On Saturdays At The Lowest Possible Prlce Of Admission-If 2D. So Muchthebetter-Fortheworking Classes. But For These The Contents Of The Building Will Be A Chaos Unless A Cheap And Compendious Guide-Book, Not A Detailed Catalogue, Be Furnished. If Thecommittee Do Notfurnishone Themselves, Let Them Select The Best From The Many Which Are Likely To Be Produced By Independent Enterprlse, And Give Facilities For Its Sale In The Building. Would It Not Even Be Possible To Provide Guides, Competently Informed, Who At Stated Intervals Might Conduct Parties Through The Galleries, Explaining The Nature And Relations Of Their Contents T Tho Catalogue At Present Printed Is Marked Provisional. It Is Easy. To Understand How Incomplete The First List Of Contents Of Such A Collection Must Almost Inevitably Be. The Non-Arrival Of Some Works, The Late Arrival Of Ethers, The Heavy Labour Thrown On Those Charged With The Superintendence Of De. Partments At Tho Last Moment Are Quite Sufficient To Account For The Incompleteness And Disorder Which Make Little Better Than Printers Pie Of Some Portions Of Thle Pre2Ent Catalogue. No Time Abo, I E Lost In Setting This To Rights. In The-Cblffolo- T Ical List Of Old Masters Appended To The Catalogae Of The Ancient Pictures Figures Should Be Introduced Referring The Repder To The Examples Of Those Painters To Be Found Here. To The Works Of Some Of The Modem. Masters Whose Importance In The History Of Native Art Warrants This The Dates Of Production Should Be Appended Inthecatalogue. We May Instance Lawrence, Wilkie, Rnd Turner As Cases In Poin. This Is Particularly Required For The Watercolour Drawinga Of The Last Master, In Which The Exhibition Is So Peculiary Rich. All Visitors Who Are Desirous Of Profiting By The Exhibition Should, Of Course, Begin With The Old Masters, And Study Their Works As Much As Possible In The Chronological Order. The Works Of The Early Italian And German Schools Are Hung In Saloon A, And Should Botalh Be Exarmined Before Passing To The Later Productions Of The Two Countries In The Vestibules, Saloons B And C, And Saloon H, To The Left, Looking Towards The Orchestra, Which Contain The Flemish And Dutch Masters Of The 17Th Century And A Eelection Of The Choicest Ornaments Of The Hertford Gallery. When This Review Of Art To The Plose Of The 18Th Century Is Concluded The Visitor May Pass With Better Chance Of Profit To The Works Of Modem English Painters, From The Predecessors Of Reynolds Down To The Contributors To Last Years Exhibition Of The Royal Academy. The Collection Of Historical Portrai.Ts, The Watercolour Gallery, And The Unrivalled Series Illustrative Of The History Of Engrving In All Its Branches, Will Each Form A Separate Subject Of Study. We May Mention That It Is In The Part Devoted To This Last Department Of The Fahibition That The Provisional Catalogue Has Been Left In Most Hopeleas Confusion. It Is Not Till Thae Pictures Have Been Carefully Examined That The Illustrations Of Design In The Various Branches Of Glass, Porcelain, And Pottery, In The Ivories, The Enamels, The Bronzes, The Furniture, And The Arms And Armour Here Collected Can Be Examined With Something Like Appreciation, For These Will Be Found To Reflect In Theirrespectivedevelopements, In Their Beauties To Be Turned To Account, And In Their Faults And Deformities To Be Avoided, The Mutual Relation, Progress, And Decadence Of The Various Schools Of Painting And Architecture. We Are Writing Principally For Those Who Will Bring Ittle Previous Knowledge To The Consideration Of This Collection. We Must Therefore At Starting Put The Visitor On His Guard Against Contempt And Hasty Irreverence Towards The First Efforts Of Painting As He Will See Them Exemplified In The Works Of The Byzantine And Early Italian Schools Which Line The End Wall Of Saloon A, Beginning On His Right Hand As He Faces Them. He Must Bear In Mind That Modern Art Took Its Rise At A Time When Ancient Art Had Become Helplessly And Hopelessly Degenerate. What It Was In Its Later Forms Is Here Indicated By The Frgments Of Ancient Fresco Contributed By Mr. Dilke, Sir M. W. Ridley, And The Earl Of Pembroke. Ancient Art Had Been Devoted To The Service Of Paganism, And Many Of The Most Influeatial Among The Early Christian Teachers Condemned Art Altogether, And Would, If They Could Have Had Their Will, Have Banished It Entirely From The Service Of Religion. But The Nature Of Man Was Too Strong For Them. The Thought Would Find Expresdon In Form As Well As In Words. Admitting This Overmutering Necessity, The Church, Though It Could Not Stifle Art, Resolved To Fetter It. The Ravages Of Barbarian Horde3, And The Internecine Struggles Of Rude Chieftains, Had Driven The Arts To The More Peaceful Evast, And Byzantium Became The Fountain-Head Of The Theorles As Well As The Practice Of Painting. The Byzantine Church Imposed On The Artists Who Wrought In Itj Service, And Who Were Generally Monks Or Priests Of Its Communion, The Sternest Limitations Of Invention And Representation. To This Day The Greek Church Maintains These Limitations. The Picture In Greek Churches Are Still Executed In Precisely The Same Manner, Still Retain The Same Faces, Forms, Draperies, And Attitudes As They Did Undler Honorius And The Comneni The Chresmologia Or Manual Of Imago Painting Which To This Day Guides The Practice Of The Paintermonks Of Mount Athos-Still The Official Workshop Of Greek Religious Painting-Is The Same As Controlled The Painters Of The 9Th And 10Th Centuries, From The Time That The Partisan Of The Use Of Images In The Church Triumphed Over Leo The Isaurian. It Is True That After The Conquest Of Italy By The Lombards A Native School Of Art, Indepenadent Of The Byzantine, Began Feebly To Develope Itself. But It Was So Rude, So Inferior In Technical Dexterity To Its Eastern Rival, That It Had Succumbed To It Before The 11Th Century, And We Have To Seek In A Few Ivory Carvings And Some Scattered Missals For Evidences Even Of Its Existenee. The Sdent Will Find Such Evidences Among The Ivories In The Mayer And Douce Collections Exhibited In This Building. Thus Fettered By The Unyielding Rules Of Byzantine Iconography, Whieh Extended Not Merely To The Types Of Particular Saints Or Saered Personages, But To The Whole Anangement Of Every Story That Was Permitted To Be Told In Colour, It Was Only By Slow And Painful Steps That Art Emerged Into Something Like Free And Dramatic Representation. All This End Wall Contains Illustrations Of This Struggle From The Stiff And Meagre Forms, The Scanty Draperies, Rigid Attitudes, And Symmetrical Arrangement Of The Byzantine Chresmology, Towards The Comparatively Unfettered Eomposition And Correct Drawing Of The Early Tusean School Of Meacio. It Was Well Done To Hang Among These Early Works Some Modern Rusia Pictures, As Showing The Unyielding Grasp Of Byzantine Art Tradition. All Namnes Attached To Small Works Of This First Century Of Italian Art Must Be Taken With Hesitation. It Is Next To Imposible Here To Refer To Any Picture As An Undoubted Example Of Cimabue Or Giotto, The Two Masters Who Usually Stand At The Head Of The Italian Emancipators Of Art From Its Byzantine Swaddlingclothes. This Is Inevitable. The Larger And Wellidentified Pictures Of The Time Are Either Immoveable Mosaics, Half-Effaced Frescoes, Or Altar Pieces Too Highly Valued To Be Obtainable By Foreign Collectors. The Painting Of Small Detached Pictures At This Period Was Rarely Practized Art Worked Exclusively For The Church. The Smaller Works Of The Time, Exhibited In Galleries, Are Either Portions Of Larger Fixed Altar-Pieces Removed From Churches And Being The Miniatures Which Embelished The Predeaa, Or Base Of The Laiger Pictlure, Or Portable Triptycles Pictures With A Double Folding Shutter, Intendea To Be Carried About By Lords Or Pre. Iates In Warlike Expeditions, Or Religious Pil. Grimages And Peregrinations. But Already In The Pictures Bearing The Name Of Duccio Da Siena 11, And Ijgolino Da Siena 12, Which Are Undoubted Works Of The Siennese School, The Observer May See Indications Of Vitalily And Dramatic Intention. Let Him Note, Espeelally In The Former, The Feeling Of Maternal Tenderness In The Virgin Mother, Aud Of Infantina Affeion In The Chllds Pressure Of His Cheek To Hers Such Expressions Are The Foreshadowing Of That Employment Observable In Succeeding Schools Of The Virgin And Her Divine Son As A Type Of Motherly Love, Even Rmore Than A Symbol Of The Mysterious Relation Of Christ To The Human Family. The Work Whaich Has Been Ascribed To Fargharitone Darezzo A.D. 1236-1313, Representing The Virgin Crowned By The Saviour, Is Unquestionably Of Later Date, And Might Be Referred With More Probability To -Some Scholar Of Giotto. The Treatmen.T And Character Ara- Precisely The Ie Ma Mi.Y Be Seen I The Lar Qqtqation6 Thovi , U It Master, In The Centre Of The Space Between The Two Doord Which Haa Itself Obviously Been Subjected To Severe Procems Of Repainting. The Only Works Here, Which We Can With Confidence Ascribe To Giotto Are The Two Fragents 1.4 And-16, Which Formed Part Of The Frescoes By That Master In The Church Of The Carmtine At Florence, Now Destroyed By Fire. They Were Actually Sawn From The Wall By Patch, The Engraver, Who Published Complete Engravings Of The Series Before The Destruction Of The Churcl There Is Giottosintensity Of Tenderness In The Head Of The Woman Who Holds The Child, And Manifest Traces Of His Grace And Comparative Freedom Of Action In The Figure Representing The Daughter Of Eterodias. Again, The Picture Ascribed To Simon Memmi 20 Is An. Inscribed And Dated Work Of The Master, Apd There Is Nothing In The Work Itelf To Disprove The Inference From The Inscription. So The Small Altarpiece With Wings 23, Bearing The Name Of Taddeo Gaddi And The Date Of 1338, Is Probably A Genuine Work Of This The Most Distinguished Of Giottos.Pupila And The Figuires With Musical Instruments 2X5, Ascribed Here To The Same Master, Are Not Unworthy Of Him. They Have Grace And Naturalness Of Action Enough To Show The Great Stride Which The Art Had Already Made From Its Byzantine. Beginnings. These Pictures, Then, We Repeat, Must Be Regarded Only As Showing The General Eharacteristics Of Italian Art Before Its First Great Advance Into Naturalness Under Masaccio. But The Visitor Must Not Suppose That Anything Here Shown Can Give Him An Adequate Idea Of The Powers Of Giotto, The Master From Whom The Real Commencement Of Tuscan, As Distinct From Byzantine Art, Should Be Dated. Giotto Can Only Be Judged In Florence, In Padua, And In Naples. The Newlyuncovered Frecoesjiu The Church Of Santa Maxis Novella, The Painted Walls Of The Arena Chapel, And The Series Of The Sacraments In The Church Of The Incoronats, Must Be Seen Before We Can Appreciate The Singular Invention, Rare Power Of Telling A Storys And Profound Sentiment Of Beauty, Which Have Crowned Giotto, The Sovereign Of Italian Art, Before Masaccio. None Of His Pupils Carried Painting Beyond The Point At Which He Left It. Andrea Orcagna Had A Power Of Conception, Especially In The Terrible, Which Places Him Apart But In Technical Mastery, And In The General Conception Of Artistic Representation, He Cannot Claim A Distinctive Throne In The Hierarchy Of Painting. But Adequately To Estimate Him We Must Study His Ast Judgment, And His Triumph Of Death, On The Walls Of The Holy Fieid Of Pisa, That Impressive Burial-Place In Which Ancient And Modern Art Have United To Solenize Death And Enforce Its Lessons On The Living. With Masaccio The Visitor To The Manchester Exlhibition May Trace The Advance Of Art To A New Reach Of Power. As Has Always Been The Case, This Is Due To A New Infusion Of Naturalness,-An Effort At More Truthful Representawion Of Things As They Appear. A Hundred Years Separate Masaccio From Giotto, But The One Left Art Still Formal And Half Fettered, The Other Left It Consummate In The Power Of Representing The Human Face And Form. The Single Work By Which Masaccio Is Here Represented-Called His Own Portrait, And Sufficiently Resembling The Acknowledged Type Of His Faoeto Justify The Designatin-Though The Carnations Have Flown, Is As Solid And Simple A Rendering Of A Youthful Head As Raphael Or Titian Could Have Painted-Startling, Indeed, In Its Reality And Strong Expresaion Of Individual Character. Inadequate As It Is To Give The Untravelled Spectator A Conception Of Masccios Range And Grasp Of Power, Which Must Be Seen In That Brancseci Chapel, In The Church Of The Carmine At Mlorence, Which For So Many Years Was The Academy Of The Men We Reverence As First In Art-Of Leonardo, And Michael Angelo, And Raphael-Its Qualities Are Marked Enough To Enable Any One To Apprecate The Gap That Separates The Wchool Of Giottofrom The Tuscan School Of The 15Th Century, Which Begins With Masaccio. The Appearance Of Every Great Master In The History Of Art Is Marked Bysuch Wide And Sudden Intervals. One Such Divides Giotto From His Predecessoe R Masacclo Marks A Second. Raphael, Leonardo, And Michael Angelo Unite To Indicate A Third. And When We Turn To Germna Art We Shall Find The Same Law Exemplified In The Cases Of The Van Eycks, Mabuse, Quentin Matays, And Rubens. We Have Dwelt At Some Length On Thesa The Incunahula Of Painting, Because It Is Here That Just Appreciation Is Most Difficult For The Untrained And The Untravelled. Everyman Has A Difficulty In Conceiving How Art Could Ever Have Been So Barbarous As It Appears In The 14Th Century. It Seems As If Any Attempt At Representation Ought To Have Been More Like Life Than This. We Have Been Anxious To Point Out That Art Did Not Begin With The Attempt At Representing Things As They Are-That It Commenced In A Rigidly Defined Religious Symbolism, And That Every Deviation Into Naturalness From The Narrow Track Marked Out By The Laws Of Byzantine Orthodoxy Was A Rebellion From Which Reverent Spirits Would Naturally Shrink, And By The Consciousness Of Which They Must Often Have Been Haunted And Checked, Even In The Effort To Which Their Perceptions And Consciencoshadimnpelled Them. That Art Was To Be The Handmaid Of Religion Was Of Itself Enough To Deter Artists From Attempts At Natural Representation. The Saviour, The Virgin The Saints, And Mnrtyrs Were Glorified Beings. The Church, Which Was The Witness Of Their Lives And The Depository Of Their Doctrines, Might Be Supposedto Be Authorized To Prescribe How They Should Be Represented To The Faithful Considerations Of Earthly Beauty And Symmetry Had No Place In Such A Matter. That Art Should Be Unlike Nature Ws No Reproach While Art Owned Only. A Supernatural Fnontion And It Is A Testimony Tothesoundecclesiastical Sensewhicb Governed The Byzantine Churchinitsstern Repression Of Private Judgment In Art, That, From The Time Naturalness Of Representation Was Introduced As An Aim In Art, Thepainter, Generationbygeneration, Grew Less And Less An Effective Aid To The Priestthat Art Gradualy Divorced Itself From The Exclusive Service Of The Altar And That Ita Nominal Dedication To Relgion Proved Altogether Insufficient To Keep It, A It Had Been, A Mere Aiceasary To The Church. Nve Hope To Trace The Progrse Of This Change By Help Of This Gallery In Future Articles. Anctester, Mv 9. The Prevalence Of A Raw Easterly Wind Produced A Hlisht Diminution In Tbe Number Of Visitors To The Exhibition On Friday. On The Other Hand, The Sale Of Season Tickets Was As Great As Ever, So That The Receipts Amounted To Much The Same As During The Preious Days-Viz., Nearly 8001. The Confidence In The Financial Sucecess Of The Undertaking Therefore Remains Unabated. During Saturday The Weather Though Enlivenedwith Occaional Gleamsof Sunshine, Was Severe, Even For An English May Yet, On The Whole, The Attendance Was Apparently Rather Better 1Han On Friday. While The East Wind Blows The Interior Of.The Building Is Cold To An Extreme, And, What Is Worse, No Means Can Be Applied To Warm It. The Very Perishable Nature And Enormous Vlue Of Its Contents Upwards Of 6,000,0001. Have Led To The Moat Stringent Precautions Being Taken Against The Possibility Of Accident From Fire No Light Or Fire Of Any Description, Or Under Any Pretence Whatsoever, Is Allowed Within The Walls, And So Rigidly Is This Law Carried Into Effect That Even The Official Letters On The Business Of The Exhibition Are Tealed At A Detached Office Far Removed. Thus When The Weather Is Cold The Building Is Cold In Proportion, And Cold It Must Remain Till Eollus Is More Propitious. As A Matter Of Course, Thisinifaences The Attendance, For The Pictures And Rare Works Of Art Can Only Be Studied By Visitors When Standing Still, And Who Therefore Feel The Low State Of The Thermometer A Most Unpleasant Adjunct To Tbh Entertainment Of The Day. The Sale Of The Provisional Catalogue Has Been So Rapid That A New One, On A Greatly Improved Plan, Will Be Issied In A Few Days. With Re-Gard To This We Would Beg To Suggest That, Among Other Improvements, It Should Contain, As Well As The Tames Of The Old Masters, Their Place Of Birth Andathe School To Which Each Belonged. Two Additional Words Would Effect This, And The Latter At Loat Would Much Facilitate General Visitors In Atudying Practicaly The O.Mparative Merits Of The P Lapte, Roma And Yenex Styles.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS151687339/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=1733f6d4,,
"Taylor, John Russell",Homage unmasks the myth,The Times,1993-Apr-12,"London, England","Galleries John Russell Taylor In Venice On A Show That Celebrates But Also Exposes Marcel Duchamp Homage Unmasks The Mvth Like It Or Not, There Is No Doubt That With Todays Conceptual Avant-Garde The Focus Has Decisively Shifted From The Artist As Maker To The Artist As Star. If Any One Person Was Responsible For This, It Was Marcel Duchamp, Now Being Anatomised In This Years Major Show At Fiats Venice Arts Centre, The Palazzo Grassi. Duchamp Was The Man Who Put A Ready-Made Bottle Stand, A Ready-Made Urinal, Into Art Exhibitions, In 1914 And 1917 Respectively, As Original Sculptures. Possibly, Some Said, As An Attempt To Open Our Eyes To The Plastic Beauty That Lies Around Us In The Least Regarded Everyday Objects Possibly, Others Suggested, As A Satire On And Send-Up Of The Whole Concept Of Fine Art In Any Case, It Was Exactly The Period Of Dada In Switzerland And The Beginnings Of Surrealism In France, So This Kind Of More Or Less Seri - Ous Prank Was Very Much In The Spirit Of The Times. Duchamps Great Strength Was That He Never Really Elu - Cidated His Inten - Tions , But Left That For Others To Do. He Was The 20Th Centu - Ry S First Artistic Guru. His Own Pro - Nouncemen T S Were Either Gnomically Duchampi Was The 2 I Century S First Artistic Guru Obscure Or Childishly Simple, So There Were Ample Opportunities For Disciples To Gather Up And Explicate Every Last Fragment From The Work - Bench . In Other Words, He Had All The Makings Of A Myth. He Clearly Wished To Be A Myth, And Duly Became One To Such An Extent That 405 Unnumbered Pages Of The Telephone Directory-Sized Catalogue Are Taken Up With Ephemerides , Telling What He Was Doing Missing A Train, Having A Telephone Conversation On Each Day Of The Year In Arbitrarily Selected Years Between 1900 And His Death In 1967. Hagiolatry Could Hardly Go Further. Compared With All This Battery Of Incidental Information, One Might Expect The Work Itself To Look Rather Puny. And Sure Enough It Does. It Seems Sad That All That Remain To Bear Witness To 81 Years Of A Life In. Art Are 20-Odd Paintings, A Number Of Objects Like Spades And Bicycle Wheels, Not To Mention Urinals And Bottle Racks, And Thousands Of Little Pieces Of Paper Bearing Faint Scrib - Bles Or Sometimes Not Even That. . Ae Of This Is Reverently Displayed, Though The Objects Are Seldom Even The Originals, Touched At Least By The Hand Of The. Master , But Replicas And Reconstructions Made After His Death, While Much Of The Material Seemingly Rescued , From Du - Cham P S Wastepaper Basket Is Shown As Reproduced Infacsimile In Some Of Thesigned Limited Editions Of His Later Years. Of Course One Can Say. That That Is The Whole Point, That Ideas Of Original Materi - Al , The Hand Of The Artist And So On, Are Shown To Be Deeply Irrelevant To Duchamp In Particular And 20Th Century Art In General. One Can, But Perhaps Not Every - Bod Y Will. The Show Itself Is Exemplary In Lay - Out And Execution. Fears Of Cuteness Set Off By The Bicycle Wheel Hear The Be - Ginning Being Pro - V Ided With A Win - Dow - Dresser S Painted Shadow Are Not Subsequently Realised. And While The Systematically Minded May Be Disturbed By The Deliberate Rejection Of Chronolog I - Cal Order, This Programmed Arbi - Trariness Is Very Much In The Spirit Of Duchamp Himself. At Any Rate, It Introduces A Teasing Element Which Seems To Have Played An Important Part In Duchamps Psychological Make-Up . The Paintings Begin With Some Charming But Conventional Land - Scapes From Around 1902 And End, In Effect, With His Famous Nu Descendant Un Espalier, A Som E - What Futurist-Looking Attempt To Re - Create The Movement As In Stop - Motion Photography, Which Caused A Sensation At The Epoch-Making New York Armory Show In 1912. Remembering That Duchamp Had Two Talented Older Artist-Brothers With Whom He Must Have Com - Pared Himself, One Has To Wonder If He Was Not Like The Would-Be Concert Pianist Who Realises He Is Just Not Good Enough To Reach First Rank And Decides To Settle Instead For Being Liberace. Whether Or Not Such A Feeling Was Responsible For His Change Of Direction, And Especially His Forsak - Ing Of Painting, He Was Clearly Not Lacking In Application Of A Sort. He Was Constantly On The Move, Con - Stantly Attracting Publicity To Him - Self , Constantly Doing Something, Usually Within A Self-Destroying Dada Convention. His Life , As Has Been Said Of So Many Who Followed In His Tracks, Became His Art, And The Trickle Of Tangible Work In The Show Is Mainly The Incidental Record Of That One All - Consuming Artwork. It Is Significant That His Most Public Years And His Major Publicity Stunts Were All In New York, Then As Now The Place Where Charisma, Whether Or Not Backed Up With Talent, Will Get You Furthest . He Was .. In New York Primarily From 1915 To 1923, And Again From 1942 Until His Death, Spending Most Of The Intervening Period In Paris, Where He Tended To Be Seen As Just One Of Many Jokey Characters Of The Avant-Garde . In A Sense He Was Certainly The Great Precursor Of Much That Is Highly Fashionable In Art Today. If There Were Any Doubt Of That, This Exhibition Would Dispel It. What Is Still Far From Dear, However, Is The Value Of Any Specific Thing He Did. It Is Tempting To Say That Seeing So Much Of It So Scrupulously , Res Pect - Fully Displayed Explodes The Reput - Ation , Which Has Always Thrived On Mystery And Myth. On The Other Hand, Duchamp Himself Would Probably Have Loved It, As The Biggest Duchampian Joke Of All.

Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1893-Apr-27,"London, England","Art Exhibitions. Up To The Moment When The Academy Opens, The Series Of One Man Exhibitions Seems To Continue Without A Break. There Are Three New Ones In Bond-Street Alone, And Another At The Goupil Gallery, Lately Transferred To The Lower End Of Regent-Street. At The Fine Art Societys Rooms, To Mr. Wetherbees Collection Of Pleasant Pictures Of English Pastoral Life Have Been Added A Large Series Illustrating Marinjon And Rokeby, The Figure Subjects By Sir James Linton And The Landscapes By Dkr. Orrock. To Name These Painters Is To Describe Their Work. Sir James Linton Supplies A Dozen Groups Or Single Figures, Finished Like Enamel, Rich In Colour, And Remarkable In The Quality Of Their Textures. These Characteristics Must Strike Every One But It Is Not Easy To Find In The Drawings Any Particular Reference To Scotts Poetry. This Painters Fault-Or Shall We Say Merit ?-Is That Al His Works Are Studies In Cclour And Texture Alone There Is Notaing Dramatic In Them They Are Artistic, And In No Sense Literary. Mr. Orrocks Landscapes Are All Studied On The Spot, And Most Of Them Painted In The Open Air, And Thus Far They Have An Element Of Truth In Them Which Is Recognizable At A Glance. The Personal Element, However, Is Strong The Artist Has His Decided Preferences In The Matter Of Colours,And Is Apt To See Scotland, Yorkshire, Even Essex And Surrey, With The Same Eyes. But The Dexterity Of His Brushwork And The Beauty Of His Atmospheric Effects Are Not To Ba Questioned. Opposite, At The Japanese Gallery, Are A Group Of Drawings Of Indiza And Ceylon By Mr. John Rarley, A Grandson Of The Eminent Contemporary Of Turner And Girtin, And Friend Of Blake. Mir. Varleys Work Is Fairly Well Known His Eastern Drawings Are Competent, Though Not Hlighly Interesting. A Much More Noteworthy Artist, And One Who Has Never Yet Received Quite The Recognition He Desorves, Is Mr. C. E. Holloway, Whose Recent Work Has Been Brought Together By Arr. Van Wisselingh In His Little Gallery At The Bond-Street End Of Brook-Street. Mr. Tholloways Sketches Of The Sea Are Quite Equal To Anything Of 3Iesdags Perhaps Some Day It Will Be The Fashion To Think Them So. The Small Show At The Gonpil Gallery Would Have Attracted More Attention If It Had Not Followed So Closely Upon The Similar And More Important Display Of T The Late Edward Calverts Work At Burlingtonhouse. But Some People Are So Keenly Interested In That Inspired Amateur, And In ,The Beautiful Dreams Of An Areadian World Which His Brush Transferred To Canvas Or Paper, That They Will Be Glad To See This Fresh Collection Of His Rare Sketches. At Messrs. Vokinss,In Great Portland-Street, There Is A Large Collection Of The Recent Drawings Of An Artist Who Is Much Admired By The Lovers Of The Infiuitely Pretty In Art, Mr. E. Wake Cook. They Are Views Of The Italian Lakes, Of E.W Zealand,And Of Other Regions, And They May Be Described As Echoes Of Turner, Crossed By Birket Foster. Extremely Conscientious, Crowded With Minute Detail, And As Full Of Colour As The Rainbow, These Drawings Are The Very Antithesis Of The Art Now Most In Vogue. Perhaps For That Very Reason They Are Worth Seeing. The Society Of Lady Artists Have Left The Egyptian-Hall And Found A Roomy And Welltlighted Gallery In Maddox-Street. Their Exhibition Is One Of The Best That We Remember To Have Seen Under Their Auspices. There Is, As Of Old, A Good Deal Of Slight And Rather Too Elementary Work, But There Is Also Much That Deserves Other Epitbets. Miss E. M. Osborns Portrait 184, Mliss Oharas Sea-Pieces, The Flowers Of Miss Helen Thornycroft, Mliss M1. S. Grose, And Miss Grace Hastie, And Miss R. Solomons Emmanuel Hospital Would Do Credit To Any Exhibition Of Water-Colours. There Is Less That Is Good Among The Oil Pictures, Where Much Of The Work Is Crude And Unformed But Here Xiss Newcombes Woodland Landscape, Miss Florence Pashs Interior Which She Calls Fairy Tales 15, Mrs. Wrights Minerals-In Emulation Of Miss Kate Wvhitleys Marvellous Productions Of The Same Kind-Aadmiss Donaldemiths Landscapes Are All Of Considerable Excellence. Lnthe Smaller Gallery Some Portraits In Pastel Should Be Remarked-Especially Those Of Miss Donald-Smith And Miss Janet Archer And Mliss C. 31. Beresfords Series Of Water-Colour Sketches, Painted In Many Different Lands, Are The Work Of A Clever Artist.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS201513115/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=d9b9b3de,,
Null,Slade Students' Part In Young Painters' Exhibition,The Times,1955-Oct-14,"London, England","Slade Students Part In Young Painters Exhibition The New Exhibition At The Institute Of Contemporary Arts, 17-18, Dover Street, Consists Of 36 Works By Eight Painters, All Of Them British, All Of Them Born Between 1916 And 1932, And Five Of Them Recent Or Present Students At The Slade School. This Emphasis On The Slade Is Of Particular Interest At A Time When A Remarkable Amount Of Public Attention Is Being Given To A Group Of Young Painters Au Of Whom Are Products Of The Royal Couege Of Art, Our Other Senior Art School. It Is No Accident That The Kensington Neophytes Have Been More In The Public Eye Than Their Bloomsbury Counterparts The College Nowadays Excels In Turning Out Young Artists Who Are Impressively Adept At Making The Most Of Their Gifts And Whose Work Is As Brashly Vivid And Appealing As It Is Precocious, Whereas The Slade Graduates And Undergraduates Of The Present Generation Are Altogether Less Sure Of Thiemselves, More Halting, More Questioning, And Therefore Much Less Prolific. Indeed, One Rather Suspects That For Every Picture Completed By A Slade Student A College Student Completes An Exhibition. This Would Certainly Seem To Be No Exaggetation In The Case Of Mr. Michael Andrews, Who Left The Slade In 1953 With The Rome Prize For Painting. Mr. Andrews Perhaps The Most Imaginative And Serious Young Painter We Have, Characteristically Contributes Just One Picture To The I.C.A. Exhibition-A Composition Of Sunbathers In A Garden Who, As He Puts It In The Catalogue, Were Supposed To Have Plumped Themselves Down Unceremoniously-But Formally With Respect To Their Surroundings. If Mr. Andrews So Rarely Has Any Tangible Record Of His Progress To Offer His Admirers That He Is In Danger Of Being Taken For A Rumour Rather Than A Person, His Low Productivity Has The Compensatory Advantage Of Precluding Repetitiousness And Making Every Picture He Completes A New Experience, For Us And For Himself. As A Consequence, A Visitor To The I.Ca. Who Happens To Be Unaware That The Appearance Of A New Painting By Mr. Andrews Is Something Of An Event Will Still Surely Feet, On Internal Evidence, That This Group Of Sunbathers Is The Outcome Of Profoundly Thoughtful Painting Which Has Had No Traffic Whatsoever With The Well-Tried Formula. The Picture, For All The Care That Has Evidently Gone Into It, Is Very Imperfect, Full Of Gaucheries And Inconsistencies, But The Drawing Of The Figures And Their Disposition In Space Have A Tautness And A Freshnessvand An Insight Which Render It Unusually Moving And Memorable. If, However, We Are Looking For A Happier Balance Between Vision And Accomplishment, We Have To Turn To Another Ex-Slade Student, Mr. Peter Snow, Who, Hardly Known As A Painter, Has Gained A Certain Reputation For His Work In The Theatre, Which Includes The -Not Very Satisfactory-Decor For Waiting For Godot. Mr. Snows Three Conservatory Still Lifes At The I.C.A. Show Him To Be A Painter In The Tradition Of Matisse With A Mastery Of Colour Worthy Of That Tradition. Mr. Snow Reveals An Ability To Reconcile Gaiety Of Mood With Seriousness Of Approach That Seems To Be The Prerogative Of The French And Is Certainly Rare Among English Painters. On The Other Hand, There Is Something Deeply English About The Suggestion Of A Kinship With Mr. Stanley Spencer That Manages To Percolate Through Mr. Snows Matisse-Ish Style. Incidental Y, It Is Interesting To Observe That Mr. Andrews Likewise Has Inherited Something From Spencer. Mr. Eric Finlay, Still A Student At The Slade, Shares Neither These Painters Link Vwith Spencer Nor, Their Seriousness. Mr. Finlay Is Evidently A Fan Of The Great Marcel Duchamp. The Note On Himself That He Contributes To The Catalogue- Wears Dark Glasses And Runs A Bawdy-House In Marrakesh -Is In Imitation Of The Dadaists One Of His Two Paintings Is Clearly Inspired By M. Duchamps Nude Descending A Staircase The Other Is Presented Behind Deliber. Ately Splintered Glass, Presumably In Recognition Of The Fact That M. Duchamps Famous Paintings On Glass Have Been Splintered In The Course Of Time. It Reflects No Credit On The I.Ca. That They Should Give A Showing To Such Meretricious Nonsense, Or, For That Matter, To The Academic Action-Paintings Of Mr. Duncan And Mfr. Kit Barker. The Other Exhibitors Are Miss Janet Barrett, Mr. Barry Daniels, And Mr. W. G. Poode.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS51336526/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=a229e138,,
From Our Special Correspondent-PARIS,France Shows its Best Sixteenth-century Paintings at Paris Exhibition,The Times,1965-Nov-22,"London, England","France Shows Laintings Its Best Sixteenth-Century At Paris Exhibition Portrait Of A Young Woman Attributed To Raphael. From Our Special Correspondent-Paris A Richly Rewarding Exhibition Of Sixteenth-Century European Painting Is At Present To Be Seen At The Petit Palais, Paris. It Consists Of More Than 360 Items -From High Renaissance To Early Baroque-Lent From Public Collections In All Parts Of France. Many Of The Pictures Are Little Known Even To Specialists And Have Left Provincial Museums For The First Time. Beginning With A Madonna Of 1511 By Fra Bartolommeo, From Besancon Cathedral, The First Two Rooms Represent The High Renaissance In Italy. The Exhibits Include Bellinis Drunkenness Of Noah From Besancons Museum, Correggios Virgin And Child From Orleans, And Carianis Delightful Lute Player From Strasbourg. Great Interest Has Been Aroused By The Raphael Portrait Of A Woman In A Gown With Gold Lame Sleeves, Set Against A Background Of Pale Yellowish Green, Known, Probably Erroneously As La Fornarina, After Raphaels Mistress. Previously Owned By Lord Acton, It Was Bought In 1890 By Strasbourg Museum As An Undisputed Raphael. Later, The Artists Hand Was Questioned And The Picture Attributed Instead To Giulio Romano. Todav T.He Experts Are Once Again In Doubt. Seeing It After Cleaning In Readiness For The Present Exhibition, They Feel That Perhaps The Original Attribution Was Correct. Raphaels Afterthought Professor John Pope-Hennessy, Keeper Of The Department Of Architecture And Sculpture At The Victoria And Albert Nluseum, Who Has Made A Visit To France To See The Picture And To Study X-Ray Photographs, Is Satisfied That It Is A Raphael. Tests In The Louvre Laboratory Reveal That Someone At A Later Stage-Possibly Raphael Himself--Filled In The Neckline With A White Muslim Guimpe. It Has Not Been Removed. Recent Cleaning Has Produced Similar Surprises In A Number Of Other Pictures, Though In Most Cases The Additions Have Been Taken Out. Infrangoiscloucts Baindediane For Instance In The Room Devoted To The E?Cole De Fontainebleau, Heavy Drapery No Longer Swathes The Limbs Of The Chief Attendant. The Bain De Diane Which Once Belonged To Cardinal Fesch, Napoleons Uncle, Has In The Past Been Attributed To Primaticcio And N Iccolo Dell Abbate, But Restoration Has Enhanced Its Beauty And Confirmed The Delicate Touch Of Clouet. It Will Return To Rouen Museum Considerably Increased In Value. Speculation Surrounds The Identity Of The Principal Character. Is She Diane De Poitiers With Henri Ll Wearing Striped Satin Approaching On Horseback ? Is She The Temptation Of St. Anthony , By Veronese. Gabrielle Destres With Henri Iv ? The Same Question Is Asked Of Dame A Sa Toilette From Dijon Mluseum, A Fascinating Portrait By An Unknown Artist, Probably Clouet. The Lady At The Dressing Table Wears A Choker Collar Of Gilt Lace, A Cross Or Medallion On A Long Jewelled Chain, And A Transparent Stole. Her Face Is Seen Again In A Pearl-Trimmed Looking-Glass A Wall Mirror Reflects The Figure Of A Kneeling Servant Searching In A Drawer. Under The Moral Stimulus Of The Reformation, A Very Different Mental Outlook Characterizes The Work Of The German Artists. Instead Of The Frank And Sensuous Enjoyment Of The French There Is An Emotional Intensity That Is Almost Visionary. One Sees It In The Work Of Diirer, Altdorfer, Baldung Grien, And Holbein, And In The Set Of Cranach Portraits From Reims. Yet In La Courtisane Et Le Vieillard . For All Its Apparent Condemnation, Cranach Dwells Lovingly Upon The Young Womans Gorgeous Russet Pink Costume With The Padded Slashed Sleeves And The Boa Of Looped Ribbons. Underlying Unity Moving From Room To Room, It Is Interesting To Discover Affinities And Common Tendencies In The Various Countries, Resulting From The Rapid Spread Northwards Of New Artistic Ideas From Italy And To Note The Underlying Unity Of Pictorial Art, Due In No Small Measure To The Enforced Migrations Of Artists In A Europe Torn By Religious Conflict. The Popularity Of The Portrait, The Cult Of The Nude. The Attraction Of Eroticism, The Preoccupation With Heroic Themes Drawn From Greek And Roman Mythology Are Each Exemplified. The Vigour And Realism Of The Flemish Masters. The Daring Gallantry Of The School Of Prague, The Creative Imagination Of Michelangelo And Of The Italian Mannerists In Florence. Parma And Rome, As Shown In The Work Of Bronzino And Correggio, The Flamboyante And Splendour Of The Venetians. Expressed By The Three Giants. Titian. Tintoretto. And Veronese, Are All Represented. Ten Superb Canvases By Vevonese Include A Portrait Of An Unidentified Voung Woman Uith Crimped Bronze-Gold Hair But The Most Imipressive Picture Is The Temptation Of St. Anthony . His First Masterpiece, Painted At The Age Of 24, And A Design For The Dome Of Mantua. Tine Pale Glowing Skin Of The Temptress Contrasts Dramatically With The Deep Reddish-Brown Shadows. The Martyrdom Of St. Stephen From Lille Museum Is Among The Best Of The Titians. It Is A Late Work, A Final Triumph Of The Artist In His Extreme Old Age. Ttians Virgin. Child And St. John The Baptist With Either Saint Agnes Or Saint Catherine Comes From Dijon Musce Des Beaux Arts. It Was Sold To Liouis Xiv By The Banker Jabach. Who No Doubt Obtained It From England When Charles Is Art Collection Was Dispersed During The Commonwealth. Earlier, It May Have Belonged To Thomas Howard, Earl Of Arundel Tarquin And Lucretia , Very Similar To The Titian In The Fitzwilliaam Museum, Cambridge, Has Recently Been Authenticated By Radiographic Examination At The Louvre. It Is Known Ro Have Belonged To Thomas Howard, Charles 1, Jabach, And Louis Xiv Before Being Sent To The Musee De Bordeaux When The French Royal Collections Were Dispersed. This Vast Exhibition In Which Nearly 200 Painters Are Represented, Covering The Artistic Development Of A Stupendous Century, Is Not Easy To Assimilate. It Begins In A Blaze Of Glory And Ends On A Note Of Bitterness And Tragetdy. It Ranges From Durerrs Study For A Madonna - Portrait Of A Woman With Flowing Hair And Downcast Eyes, To El Grecos Mystic Blue-Hooded Virgin, Lent By Strasbourg Museum. It Spans 100 Years Of Changing Intellectual Values. From Bellegambes Gothic Altarpieces To Rubenss Crown Of Thorns Brought From The Obscurity Of The Hospice De Grasse In The South Of France. It Comes To A Close With Two Flagellations Hy Carracci And Caravaggio, Violent, Emotional, Theatrical, In Which European Art Moves Forward Into A New Phase.

No Indulgence Is Needed To Notice The Sixth Exhibition Of The Streatham Art Society, At The Streatham Hall, For It Compares Favourably With The Average Of Minor Exhibitions In Bondstreet. Indeed, If It Has A General Defect It Is That It Shows Very Little Of That Stammering Of The Talented Amateur Which Often Makes A Visit To Exhibitions Off The Beaten Track A Grateful Experience.

I Mr. Dunthorne, Of Vigo-Street, Has Just Opened To The Public What Can Hardly Fail To Be Ono Of The Most Interesting Among The Minor Exhibitions Of The Day. Be Has Brought Together A Loan Collection Of The Water-Colour Drawidgs Of The Late Frederick Walker, A.R.A., And Has Secured Many Of The Most Famous Examples, Such As The Harbour Of Refuge, The Lishmongers Shop, The Ferry, The Old Gate, And Two Of Mr. Grahams Exquisite Garden Scenes, Stobhall Gardens And Lilies. Altcgether There Are 46 Drawings And Two Important Sketches In Oil, One Of The Latter Being The Plough, A Finished Study For The Large Picture. The Character Of Walkers Genius Is So Well Known, And So Much Has Been Said And Vwritten About It Both In His Lifetime And After His Premature Death, That There Is No Need To Discuss It At Any Great Length Here. Enough To Say That Those Who Did Not See Mr. Desehamnps Exbibition In 1876 Will Do Well To Repair That Omission Now While Those Who Studied Walker Then Will Be All The More Glad Of A Fresh Opportunit Of Enroying His Admirable Art They Will See It Herefin All Its Phases, From The Very Early Blackberrying, A Drawing Made In 1860 And Showin The Strongest Tiaces Of The Influence Of Mr. Birket Moster, Down To The Last Exhibited Drawing, The Old Gate, And The Still Later Sketch, The Unfinished Work Cn Which Walker Was Engaged Just Before His Death, And Which He Prophetically Called The Unknown Land. The Excellent Essay Of M1Ra. Comyrs Carr, Which Is Reprinted As A Preface To-The Catalogue, Contains All That Is Known Or That Need Be Told Of The Story Of Walker Life, From His Birth In 1840 To His Death In Scotland In 1875. Be Was A London Lad, Who Early Showed A Strong Taste For Drawing. Be Entered An Architects Office And Soon Left It, And Was Then Apprenticed To Mr. J. W. Whymper, The Wood Engraver. In 1859 We Find Him Engaged In Illustiatna Once A Week, And Thus Becoming Associated With Such Leading Artists As Mr. Millais, Mlr. Tenniel, And Others. Then He Wvas Introduced To Thackeray, And At Oneand-Twenty Was Honoured With A Request For Anillustration To One Of The Roundabout Papers, Which Is Of Especial Interest, Being Given In The Catalogue Of This Exhibition Togetber With A Facsimile Of Thackerays Own Pen-And-Ink Hint Which Walker Developed. From This Time Forward He Became A Regular Illustrator Of The Corxhill Magazine, In Which Many Of His Best Subjects Appeared. Mieanwhile, He Began To Exhibit At The Royal Academy, Coming Rapidly To The Front Until In 1867 He Produced What Is Commonly. Thought To Be His Masterpiece, The Bathers, A Picture Which Placed Him At Once In The Foremost Rank Of Living Artists. The Reputation Then Obtained Has- Gone On Steadily Growing, And It Is Difficult To Believe That Walker Will Ever Decline From The High Position Which He Now Holds In The Estimation Both Of Artists And Of The Educated Public-On A Level With Mason As An Artist Of Sentiment And Feeling, And Far Superior To Miason As A Master Of Technique. It Is Not Necessary To Describe Or Criticize In Detail The Works Exhibited In Vigo-Street. Those Of Them That We Bave Named Are Suffieiently Well Known As It Is, And Need Neither Introduction Nor Guarantee. We Would Only Call Attention To The Very Beautiful Drawing Of The Ferry, Lent By Mr. Lehrnanu, And This Because Of The Lovely Etching That Has Just Been Executed Of It By Mr. R. Wv. Macbeth, A.R.A. Nwo Better Tribute To Walkers Genius Has Ever Been Paid Than This Of His Admirer And Brother Artist, Who Has Succeeded In A Truly Remarkable Way In Transferringfl To His Plate The Spirit, The Tone, And The Minutest Details Of The Original Drawing. Of The Rest, Some Of The Most Interesting Examples Are Those That Are Smallest In Scale, Such As The Old Gate, Which We Have Already Mentioned, The Rainv Day, And A Delicious Little Drawing Called The Chaplains Daughter 44, An Illustration Of One Of 3Iss Thackerays Stories. There Is To Be Seen At The Bcrlington Gallery, In Old Bond-Street, A Rather Notable Collection Of Sketches Of Highland Scenery By Mr. A.W.Weedon, A Well-Known Member Of The Institute. On The Whole These Drawings Seem To Us The Best, The Most Accurate, And The Most Spirited Performances That Have Ever,Come From Mir. Weedons Hand. The Large Central Work, A Spate On The Logan, Is A Very Vigorgus And Ratber Remark-Able Transcript Of A Striking Scene. M1R. Weedon Has Evidently Studied The Older Masters, Especially David Cox, To Considerable Advantage. At Another Galery, Mr. Koekkoeks, In Piccadilly, There Is Now Besides Munkacsys Picture Condemned To Death, Already Described By Us, A Large And Noteworthy Historical Work By A Rising Belgian Artist, M. Van Der Ouderaa. The Subject Is Taken From That Inexhaustible Field, The Spanish Rule In The Netherlands. The Picture Represents The Moment Before The Execution Of A Beautiful Girl, Condemned To Death For The Assassination Of A Spaniard Who Had Insulted Her. The Story Is One Of The Best Known In The Annals Of The Netherlands, And The Artist Has Portrayed It With No Little Mastery.

Arthur Tooth And Sons, 155, New Bondstreet, The Imaginative, Poetical, And General Artistic Qualities Are So Much Ahead Of Technical Accomplishment That It Is Difficult To Place Them Fairly. Not That Mr. Yeats Falters In Execution For Better Or Worse, He Carries The Thing Through With A Remarkable Effect Of Unity But That Lie Hardly Begins To Organize His Brushwork. He Paints As The Bird Sings. His Strong Points As An Artist Are His Feeling For Form As An Emotional Weapon, And His Instinct For Tone And Colour. Althouh The Subjects Of The Pictures Belong To Maturity, The Point Of View Expressed In Them Is Pretty Much That Of Stevensons Childs Garden Of Verses. They Are Romantic About Quite Ordinary Things- Mail Coach Eoad, The Hackney Car, Coming Up Sligo River, Early Morning, And Dublin News Boys.

Null,The International Exhibition,The Times,1871-May-02,"London, England","T1E International Exhibition. The First Of A Series Of International Exhibition Of The Fine Arts And Of Industry Was Opened At Soulth Kensington Yesterday By The Prince Of Wales, On Beh0If Of The Queen, And Was Made The Occasion Of An Imposing State Pageant. To Most People Great Exhibitions Have Become Somewhat Trite And Even Tiresome. That Of 1851 Was New, Instructive, And Delightful. The Palace Of Crystal Which Sprang Up In Thos Days Seemed Almost Too Subtle And Delicate A Creation To Be Coupled By Builders, Contractors, Androughhandicrafts. It Wassuggestive Rather Of Firydon And The Genii, Of The Lamp, And Helped Powerfully To Arouse And Sustain Our Wonder And Admiration. When This Glittering Casket And The Treasures It Contained Passed Array One Or More Crystal Palaces Were Establiished Among Us M Permanence And Nine Years Ago There Arose Another Great Exhibition, Displaying Two Vast Domes Of Glass Each Larger Than The Dome Of St. Peters. That, Too, Was Successful But The Parent Exhibition Was Copied Without Being Improved I Upon Both At Home And Abroad, Until The Plan Which 20 Years Ago Was So Novel And Agreeable Seemed Work-Ed-Out And Wearisome. Other Causes Contributed To The Growing Unpopularity Of Great Exhibitions Fashioned After The First Model. Manufacturers And Inventors Found It Exceedingly Expensive To Exhibit, While, After In- Eurring The Expense, They Might Chance To Be Robbed I Of The Merit Due To Them By Some Accident Or Prejudice. Havingregard To These Conditions, The! Royal Commissioners Of 1851 By Whom The Present Exhibition Is Promoted, Wisely Determined To Alter Materially The Conditions On Which It, And Its Successors Should Be Based. To Begin, This Is Not A Great Exhibition In The Con- Ventional Sense. It Is Not A Noahs Ark Into Which All Industries, Products,And Inventions Are Admitted, Classified, And Hurriedly Placed Accordina To Their Supposed Merit. The Manufactures Now Shown Are Contined To Woollens, Worsteds, And Pottery. Next Year Two Or Tlhree Other Industries Will Have Their Turn. Every Year, However, The Fine Arts,Giving That Phrase A Liberal Interpretation, Will Be Represented So Will Works Of Scientific Invention And Horticultare. At A Time, Too, When A New Education Act Is Beingadministered, A Collection Of Educational Applianes Is Very Apt And Useful And These Will Be Found In The Buildings Yesterday Opened. Latstly, With A Viewv To Ease Both The Minds And Pcckets Of Exhibitors, The Royal Commissioncrs Have Discarded The System Of Medals, Certificates, And Prizes They Ap- Point In Each Department A Committee Of Taste,Who, I As At The Royal Academy, Decidce Whether, Having Re- I Gard To The Space At Their Command, The Objects Sent Are Wortly Of Admission And Every Object Admitted Then Stands On Its Own Merits, No Personal, Trade, Or! International Jealousy Beina Created By Awards Which May Be Just, But Which, Through Accident Or Bias, Have Often Hitherto Been Unsatisfactory. It Is Necessary To Explain At Starting How The New Exhibition Departs From Tradition, Not Aiming, Like Its Predecessors, To Contain A Little-Or, Rather, A Good Deal-Of Everything, And Being Therefore Much Less Bewildering. The Building Itself, Too, Is Utterly Unlike Those Of 1851 And 1862. Indeed, Visitors Who Came To South Kensington Yesterday Had To Ask, When Close By The Eixhibition, Where Is It ? There Is No Transept, Glowing In The Sun There Is No Nave, And There Arc No Domes, Large Or Small. Take The Gardens Of Theroyalhorticu,Ural Society For A Quadrangle,And They Make A Magnificent One Imagine Galleries Of One And Two Stories As Quadrants, Connected With The Albert Hall And Utilizing The Arcades Of The Horticultural Society With A Portion Of The Old Galleries Of The Exhibition Of 1862 Upon The South, And You Have A Rough Idea Of The International Exhibition Of 1871. The Galleries On The Garden Side Are Of Red Brick Faced With Terra Cotta They Are Meant To Be Permanent And Fulfil Admirably The Purpose For Which They Were Designed By Lieutenant-Colonel Scott But They Form No Architectu. Ral Landmlark In South Kensington, Which Has, Indeed, Plenty Of Such Distinctions Already. In Default Of The Necessary Spaca In The New Line Of Buildinos, The Chief Part Of Yesterdays Ceremonyi Was Appointed To Be Held In The Conservatory Of The Royal Horticutltural Society, A Very Graceful And Pretty Interior, But Too Smallfor A Pageant In Whichi So Many Took Part And Which So Manymora Vainly Wished To See. A Dais Covered With Scarlet Cloth Was Placed At The Southern Side Of The Conservatory For The Royal Party And Their Attendants. In Front Of This Dais Were Placed The Diplomatic Corps And Distinguished Visitors And On Either Side, Separated By A Slight Barrier, Seats Were Reserved For Those Who Had Acquired The Muchcoveted Right To Enter. Opposite The Dais Was The Southern End Of The Royal Albert Hau, Entered By A Graceful Gallery Connected With. The Conservatory By Two Flights Of Steps. Probably This Gaulery And The Conservatory Proper Will Together Hold 3,000 People, And Both Were Filled. By 11 Oclock Little Room Was Left For Later Comers, Except Those Who Had A Part To Play In The Pageant. There Were Those Who Predicted That,X This Being May-Day, The Weather Wotuld Be Wet, Cold, And All That Poets Ignore. The Rain, It Raineth Every Day Was, In Fact, True As To The Last Week Or Two Of April But There Was A Fortunate Change, And Yesterday, Save One Passing Shower, And A Suspicion Of Chiliness, Was As Bright And Genial A Day As Could Be Desired. The Conservatory, With Its Branching Pahns And Tropical Plants Would Have Been Dull Indeed Without Abundant Smnliaht. The Sun, However, Assisted At The Cere- Mony With Genial Warmth And Rays Which It Seemed Ungratefull To Vward Off By Awnings. Occasional Gleams Could Not Be Denied Entrance, And Then These, Gaining Strength In Their Passage Throug,H The Glazed Roof, Lit Upon A Scarlet Uniform Or Civic Robe The Wearer Seemed Ablaze. All The Visitors Passed Through The Albert Hall And Entered The Conservatory By One Or Other Of The Flights Of Steps Already Mentioned. The Diplomatists Mustered Early Their Uniforms Glittering Lace, Orders, And Crosses. The Turkish Fez Was There With Officers In White In Light Blue, And In Dark Blue Coats, Contrasting With The English Staff Officers In Scarlet And White Plumes, Through Whom They Passed Ton Their Way Towards The Dais. One Diplomatist, Distrustful Of The English Climate, Especially On May-Day, Wore A Loose Overcoat Of Dark Blue Velvet Trimmed With Costly Fur, And Loo.Ed Like Avenetian Doge Or Senator. Thenthere Wqs A Childofthe Sun,Elsao Diplomatist In Becoming Uniform And Presently Entered The Nawab Nazim Aud His Two Sons,In Lustrous Dresses Of Gold Stuff, And Turbans Glistening With Precious Stones. Lord Hough. Ton, As A Deputy-Lieutenant, Moved Here And, There. The Lord Mayor, Attended By Mace And Sword Bearers, Was Conspicuous In The Throng Scarlet Robes Of Aldermen, The Purple, Robes Or Robes Of Mazarin Blue Worn By Councillors And Deputies From The City Were Plentiful And Provincial Mayors, Wearing Their Robes And Gold Chains Of Office, Added To A Scene As Highly Coloured, Perhaps, As Has Been Often Witnessed Of Late In Our Undemonstrative Days. In This Gathering, As Time Passed, Were Mingled The More Sober Court Uniforms Of Dark Blue And Gold Lace, With Here And There The Still More Sober Uniform Of Our Volunteers. Lord Elcho Wore The Gray, More Useful Perhaps, Though Less Brilliant, Than The Scarlet Thie Bishop Of Winchester, Happily Recovered From His Sudden Illness, Was Present, But Not Robed. Soon After 12 Oclock The Royal Party Arrived At The! Northern Entrance To The Albert Hall, Where They Were Met By The Rcoyal Commissioners For Tne Exhibition Of 1851, And Were Escorted To The Conservatory. Thte Princess Christian, Wrho Wras Expected, Was Kept Aw Ay By Illness. The Prince Of Wales, Who Wore The Scarlet Uniform Of A General Ofiicer, Conducted The Countess Of Flanders, The Count Of Flanders Led The Princess Mary. Princeajohn Of Gllcksbu Rg Followed, With The Duke Of Camibridre. Princedward Of Saxe-W Eimar, Prince Teak, Tho Lords And Ladies In Waiting, And Tho Great Officers Of State-A Brilliant Thronor. The Home Secretary, Mr. Bruce, Mr. Goschen, Fr. Ayrton, And Mir. Forstewere The Ministers Present. Neither The Premier Nor Mr. Lowewasthere. Mr. Disraeli Appeared Amongthe Royalcommissioners. Whenthe Royalprocessioni Entered, A Military Band Stationed At The Foot Of The Staircase, Played The National Anthem, Which Was Followed By Metrical Version Of The 148Th Psal2 , Sung, And Played To The Austrian National Air. But The B And Overpowered The Chorus, Who Were Under The Disadvantage Of Being Stationed Much Further Off The Dais, And From That Distant Position Struggled Vainly Tobe Heard. Meanwhile The Prince Of Wales And The Rest Of The Royal Party Had Taken Their Position Upon The Dais, Standinm In Line, With The -Personages Of The Court And The Great Officers Of State Behind Them. The Prince Of Wales Had On His Right The Countess Of Flanders, Prince 3Oh-A Of Gliiek-Sberg, The Duke Of Camnbridge, And Prince Christian And Oni His.Left The Princess Mary, Tho Coiunt Of Flpanders, And The Prince Of Teak. Some Hunadreds Of Official Personages Wore Then Presented To The Prince Of Wales,. Approaching The Dais In Order, And Defiling In Front Of The Royal Party, The Prince Acknowledging The Saluitation Of Each Idy A Gracious Bow. Th Duke Of Camibridge Presented The Inspector-General Of Fortifications, The Deputy Adjutant-General Of The Royal Engineers, Andl The Military Officers Assisting In The Exhibition Prince Christian, As A Royal Commissionler, The Officers Of The Exhibition Staff, Andl Members Of Committees Engraged In The Fine Arts Division The Prince Of Teak, Also A Royal Commissioner, The Officers Of The Exhibition Staff And Members Of Commiittees Engaged In The Industrial Division Lord Granville, Tlle Foreign Comamissioners. Lord Henry Lennox Presented The Council Of The Society Of Arts Who Wore Mixsing For A Few Momenta When Called For The Bishop Of Winchester Performed The Same Office For The Council Of The Royal Horticultural Society, And Lord Houghton For The Official Reporters Of The Exhibition. Lf. Braice Next Preented Several High She-Riffs Of Counties, The Lord Mayor Of London, And The Provincial Mlayors Invited To Attendl The Ceremony Sir J3. Pakcington, The Musical Committee For The Exhibition Mfr. Chichester Forteacue, Several Chairmen Of Chambers Of Commerce, The Lord Mayor Closing This Long And Somewhat Tedious Part Of The Proceedings By Presenting Members Of Some Of The City Companies. Then Colonel Scott, The Secretar Of The Royal Commissioners, Banded Their Report T The Home Secretary, Who Presented It To The Prince, Who Received It On The Part Of Her Majesty. The Report, Whichi Was Taken As Read, Was As Follows To Trse Right Hox. Henrcy Austis Enrtce, Ml.P. Oncx Of Hert Majexstys Pncrczsal Secreaxris Of State. Sir,-I. Her Majestys Cemmissioners For The Exhibitionk Of 1851, Incorpotated By Royal Charter To Dispose Of The Surplus Arising From That Exhibition In The Promotion Of Objects Tending To Increase The Means Of Industrial Education Aind To Extend The Influience Of Science And Art Upon Prodctie Idusry,Hav Toreprt Hatin The Discharge Of The Rus Comited T Thm Tey Averesolved, Toestablih Aseres F Anul Iteratinalexhbiions Of The Fin Ars Nd F Idutry Th Frstof Hih Is Open This 2.Durngthe20Years Which Have Elapsed Since The Great Exhbto F15 Various Exhibitions Have Taken Place In Thi And Other Countries, And Her Majestys Coinniissieners Have Not Failed To Take Advantage Of The Informsation Which The Different Organizations Of Suich Exhibitions Have Afforded In Determaining The Principles On Which The Present Series Should Be Based, In Order As Far As Possible To Increase Their Practical Utility. 3. Her Majestys Commissioners Observed That The Tendencv Of Such Exhibitions Has Been To Enceurage Undue In Crease In Their Size, To Admit Objects In No Way Distinguishable For Any Peculiar Merit Beyond Those To Be Obtained In The Ordinary Way Of Trade, And To Throwv Upon Exhibitors Who Wore Influenced By Considerations Apart From The Actual Sale Which Might Be Made In The Exhibition Itself A Heavier Tax Than They Were Inclined To Bear. T4. It Had Also Forced Itself Upon The Attention Of Her Majestys Commissioners That The Systesa Of Pronouncing Definite Opinions On The Merits Of This Or That Production By Means Of Juries Led To Inconveniences. The Estimation Of The Merits Of The Goods Of Each Country Was Often Determined Very Much,In. The Proportion Of The Number Of The Jurors It Was Allowed To Name. It Was Impossible To Find Jurors With Sufficient Technical Kssowledgo Of All The Subdivisions Nteessarily Grouped Under One Heading To Pronounce Comprehensie And Correct Judmsats On The Comparative Excellencee Ovf The Objects Exhibited And Amid The Enormous Rmas Of Objects Which Such Immense Exhibitions Brought Togeother Maany Oversights Occurred Which. Did Injustice To Intdividuals. 5. In Settling The Principles For Placin- The Objects Inl The Exhibition Of 1851, It Was The Strong Wists Of The Prince Consort That The Arrangement Should Be By Classes And Not By Nationalities-A Wish Which It Was Impossible To Realize In Such A, Novel Anad Vast Undertaking-But Her Majestys Commissioners Feel Satisfaction In Having In The Present Year, In Great Measure, Carried Out The Wishes Of The Great Founder Of Interunational Exhibitions And In Futura Years They Intend To Carry The Principle Into Effect Without Exceptions. By This Means Greater Scora Will Be Given To The Publio For The Actual Comnparison Of The Works Of Different Countries, And The Educational And Practical Value Of Such Displays Will Be Much Increased. .6. Guiided By These Ideas,Ror Majestys Commissioners Arrived At The Following Conclusions, And Have Endeavourea To Oive Effect To Thiem In The Present Exhibition. A. To Comnflo The Exhibition Of Each Year To Two Or Three Industries Only, But To Admit Every Year Works Of Fine Art, Scientific Inventien, Aud Horticulture. I. To Admit Such Objects Only As Might Be Seleoted As Worthy Of Exhibition By A Competent Committee Of Selection. C. To Group These Objects By Classes And Not By Nation- Alities. In The Ease Of Fine Arts,Certaine Alight Modifications Of The Role Have, For Thlis Year Only, As Alreadly Intimated, Been Admitted. D. To Save To Exhibitors, So Far As Possible, The Cost And Trouzble Of Exhibiting, By Providing For Them Glass Cases, Stands, Steam Power, And Other Appliances For The Proper Exhibition Of Their Objects, And Also By Enploying Ageants Who Will Answer Inquiries Respecting The Objets And Generally Watch Oyer The Interests Of The Exhibitors. 7. With The View Of Increasin The Educational Value Of The Exhibition, Her Kajestys5Commisioners Have Also Made Arrangements For Issuing, Withint A Few Weekcs Of The Opening Of The Exhibition, Reports On The Various Classes Of Objects. In. These Reperts An Attempt Will Be Made To Inculcate Such Principles As Will Enable The Pablio To Arrive At A Stadrar Of Judgment, And Form Its Own Opinionsi Upon Them. S8. In Discardling The Jury System Her Majestys Commiissionkers Also Abandon That Of Giving Prizes, Which Had. Ro.Ved A Source Of Dissaltisfaction And Sometimes Of Sabse. H Admission To The Exhibition Itself, In The Opinion Of Hler Majestys Commissioners, Should He Viewed As Conferring A Distinction Worthy Of Competition. 19. Her Majestys Commissioners Desire To Acknowledge The Patience And Conscientiousness With Whichi The Ladies Alnd Gentlemen Eminent In The Spheres Of Art, Science, And Ndustry,Who Were Invitedto Act As Committees Of Selection, Save Carried Oat Their Arduoius And Reisponsible Duties. C10. In The Design Of The Royal Albert Hall, Erected To The Memory Of The Prince Consort, Considerable Provision Had Been Made For The Exhibition Of Objects In And Around The Miain Chamber Of The Structure. Her Majestys Comnssiasiooers Have Therefore Taken Advantage Of The Space Thus Afforded For This Years Exhibition, While For The Main Portions Of The Exhibsitions They Have Erected On Each Side Of 11. Theyvhavedevoted A Further Sum Of 25,0001. In Providianf Fittisgs, Furniture, And Cases For The Exhibition Kaleierse, For Certain Necessary Work In The Adjacent Buildings To Enable Them To Be Used Las A Part Of The Exhibition Space, And To Maeet The Preliminary Expenses Attending The Undertaking. The Total Cost, Therefore, Of Openingthie, The First Of The Series Of Exhibitions, Including The Permanent Gtructuires Which Wil Be Available For The Whole Series, Will Be 100,0001. Fc 22 The Representationx Of All Branchies Of The Fine Arts, Ofscientific Inventions, Andof Horticulture Takes P Lace This Year, As It Will Do In Sabsequent Years, And Hfer Mlajestys Commissioners Have Soeleted Woollen And Worsted, Pottery, And Educational Appliances As The Manufactures And Industries For The Exhibition Optned This Day. 13. Her Majestys Commissioners Have Also Decided That During The Exhibition Representations Of Music, As A Branch Of The Fine Arts Shall Take Place In The Royal Albert Hall, With A View To Tee Improvemient Of The Taste For Muisic, Which Has Aot Hitherto Met With That Attention In England As An Elevating And Educational Instrument Whiceh Has Been Bestowed Upon It In Other Civilized Countries. The Fouir Nationalities Of England, Franco, Germany, And Italy Will Be Spccially Represented By Musical Compositions On This Day. 114. To This Report Her Majesty Commissioners Append The Catalogue Of The Exhibitioa Of The Preseat Year, Euume. Ratiug Upwardsa Of 8 000 Objects Or Groups Of Objlects, And They Humbly Trust Tht Their Work This Year Will Receive Hfer Majestys Graoious Favoutr And Approval. De15. It Was Long Since Announcled To The World That This Exhibition Would Open On The Lat Of Way, For It Appearead To Her Majestys Commissioners That The Present Series Of Exhibitions Could Not He Opened More Appropriately Than On The Anniversary Of Tlhe Day On Which The First Great Inter.

The Prince Then, Advaucing To The Edge Of The Dais, Saidj In A Clear Foice, Distinctly Heard Even In The Gallery, On Behalf Of Her Miajesty The Queen I Proclaim The International Exhibition Now Open. His Royal Elighness, Passing At Once To The Balcony Overlooking The Horticultural Gardens, Made Proelamation To The Same Effect To The Crowd There Assembled, In Both Cases It Was Received With Cheer8, The State Trumpeters Blowing A Stirring Blast, While By Preconcerted Si-Anal The Artillery In The Park Fired A Salute. 1 Those Persons Who Had Been Presented To The Prince Had, Meanwhile, Retiring To The Galleries, Formed There In Procession. This Was The Order Of Their Going, And Wh1En. The Royal Permnit Had Been Given To Open The Building Thley Went At Once Heralds And State Trumpeters, The Contractor For The Bmldiun Mr. Lucas, The Fine Arts Staff And Committoo For The . Xhibition, The Industrial Staff And Committees Of The Exhibitions, The Military Staff Of The Exhibition, The Foreign Acting Cemmissioners, The Council Of The Royal Horticultural Society, The Counci Of The Society Of Arts, Oficial Reportcrs, The Chairen Of The Chambers Of Commerce, The Layors Of The United Kingdom, The City Companies,Tho Lord Mayor And Corporation Of Londou, The Hish Shetoffs, The General Lurposes Committe Forthe Ex- Hibition,Er Fajesto Oommissionersfortheehibitionn9 Royal Hichxess The Prince Of Wvales And Her Royal Nigh. Ness The Countess Of Flanders, The Royal Personage Presents The Lxdies And Genjtlemen In Waiting, And Offlicers Of State. The Routo Taken Lay First Through The East Gallery, Devoted To Fine Art, And Approached From The Conservatory By A Glazed Arcade. Beneath Is The Porcelain, And It Is Said, Probably With Truth, That Re Finer Show Of Modern Work In This Branch Of Artmanufacture Has Never Yet Been Brought Together In Any Country. But Yesterday The Porcelain Was Neglcoted, The Procession Passing Through The Gauery On The Upper Story. This Gallery, 600Ft. Long, Is Broken Up Mto Rooms, And Though The Separation Ia A Nominal One It Is Enough To Avoid Uniformity And Justify A Distinctive Name To Each Division. The Royal Pavty Could Not But Be Struck By The Extreme Merit Of The Pictures From Belgium, Which Stands Foremost Among The Foreign Contributories,And His Royal Highncs The Countof Flanders, Who Is A Commissioner For Belgium, Might Well Be Complimented On The Rich Display Of Art Sent Here Under His Auspices. In One Of These Rooms The Long Line Of Canvas Is Agreeably Broken By Reproductions Of Shields, Tazzas, And Plaster Casts Of Architectural Remains, Conspicuous Among- Which Is A Reproduction Of The Eastern Gateway Of The Great Buddhist Tope, At Sanchi, In Central India, In The Territory Of The Begum Of Bhopal. This Remarkable Cast, Taken With Immense Labour By Lieutenant Cole And His Assistants, Is Supposed To Date From The Commencement Of The Christian T Era And Its Primitive Carvings Of Elephants And Other Designs, Its Ungainly Form,- It Attracted Universal Attention. The French Court Has Naturally Been Lilled Under Difficulties, But It Represents Not Unworthily The Artistic Power Of France. Some Well-Remembered Paintings Were Pointed Out To The Royal Party As They Passed,Such As The Mlarie Antoinette Of Paul De La Roche And The Familiar Portrait Of Madame Rosa Bonheur. There Was One Dicture, By M. Regnault, Which Commanded Rather Than Attracted Observation Itis Called An Execution In The House Of A Moor. The Eye Turned With Relief To Auother Work By The Same Artist On The Opposite Wall-An Equestrian Portrait Of The Late General Prim, Among The Mob Of Madrid Lie Knew So Well How To Control. So The Cort4G Passed On, Often Inclined To Linger,But Forced To Move Forward In Order To Keep A Continuous Line. Here, As Throughout The Whole Of The Art Collection, Pieces Of Statuary Are Interspersed In The Centre Of The Gauleries,With Glass Cases In Which Goblets,Vases, Carvings In Wood And Ivory, Jewelry, And Line Metal Work Are Seen. At Intervals, Too, You Can Walk From The Courts Into The Open Air Upon The Flat Roof Of The Arcades, And Rest And Refresh The Eye Wvith The Tender Green Which Spring Has Caued Forth In The Gardens Enclosed. From The Eastern Galleries The Procession, Descending To The Ground Floor, Passed Through Corridors In Which Are Arranged The Meyrick Collection Of Armour From Goodrich Court. India Contributes Some Native Armour-Breast-Guards Of Rhinoceros Hide, Elbow Gauntlets Of Damascened Steel And The Like,Sometimes Bearing Invocations To Ali While In Silent Contrast To The Cross-Bows And Match-Locks, The Arquebus, And The Martel-De-Fer, The Men In Buff And The Knights In Armour, Are Ranged A Few Empty 9-Inch Shells Weiglhing 3021B.,With A Bursting Charge Of 181B. A Good Many Members Of The Procession Looked As Though They Would Like To Stop For A Few Minutes In The Refreshment-Rooms Which Were Skirted At This Part Of The Route Btut The Trumpeters Sounded At Each Stae, And Fate Was Inexorable. Passing More Rapidly Througlh The Southern Courts, Dedicated To Bricks And Terra-Cotta Ornaments, And Through The Interesting Fish Couection Arranged By Mfr. Frank Buckland, The Royal Party Found Themselves In The Fine Arts Courts On The Western Side, Where Modern British Art Has Clothed The Walls With Glowing Canvas, And You Pass From Room To Room Till The Eye Almost Refuses To Take In Either Form Or Colour. In One Of These Rooms Are Ranged The Prize Fans. The Rule That No Rewards Are To Be Given Is Broken In This Case Alone. The Queen Offered A Prize Of 401., The Competition Being Restricted To Ladies Under 25, But This Has Not Been Awarded. Among The Prize-Holders Is Plincess Louise, Who Contributes A Fan Painted Last February, And Giving A Very Lively, Vigorous Representation Of A Skating Scene. There Was, Of Course, Much Stopping To Identify This Sketch. The Decoratiyo Furniture, The Sculpture, Metal-Work, Indian Jewelry, Mosaics, Carvings, And Other Art Objects In The Western Galleries Were Eagerly Scrutinized, But Stragglers Were Soon Recaued, And Reminded That More Leisurely Inspection Must Be Reserved For Future Visits. So A Good Mile Of Galleries Was Traversed The Royal Party, Re- Turning To,The Point From Which They Had Set Out, Proceeded Through The Hall To Their Carriages At The North Entrance, Without Waiting For The International Concert That Was To Follow And The Exhibition Of 1871 Was Thrownn Opon Td Undistinguished As Well As Distinguished Visitors. The Vocal And Instrumental Concert, Or Exhi-! Bition Of Musical Art, As It Was Somewhat Pompously Described In The Printed Programme, Began With A Splendid Performance Of The Overture To Der Freisnhiito, Under The Direction Of Sir Michael Costa. The Hall Being Crammed Literally In Every Part, The Orchestral Effaect Was Much More Encouraging Thanat Either Of The Concerts Given By The Society Of Arts, Or Even At That Organized By The Sacred Hlarmonic Society, When Mendelssohns Oratorio, .Lfijalh, Was Essayed. A Crowded Audience Seems To Be One Of The Essential Conditions Of Musical Success At The Royal Albert Hall. After Der Freisc7Tz The Ner Pieces Written Expressly For The Opening Of The Exhibition Were Heard Insuccession,Conductedbytheirrespectivecomposers. On Such An Occasion Criticism Would Be Entirely Out Of Place, And We Shall, Therefore, Confine Ourselves To A Mere Description Of The Plan And Character Of Each Work, More Especially As We Feel Convinced That Other Opportunities Of Bearing And Estimating Theni At Their Value Will Speedily Be Forthcoming. To Begin From The Beginning-Italy Was Reprosented By Signor Ciro Pinsuti, A Gentleman Lono Resident Among Us, And Deservedly Held In High Esteem. Siganor Pinsutis Contribution Was A Fourpart Chorale, Set To The Subjoined Stanzas Of Lord Houghton- O, People Of This Favoured Land, Witbin This Peaceful Orbit Met, We Strike The Chords With Trembling Hand, The Voice Within Us Falters Yet While On This Point Of Time We Staud, Shall We Remember Or Forget? We Must Remember Those Good Days When First We Bid The Nations Flu The Fairy Halls We Dared To Raise, By Genius Wed To Earnest Will,- And All Was Pleasure, Power And Praises Tho Fair Reward Of Toil And Skill. So Let This Hapoy Memory Veil From Present Gheuhts The Later Woe- Now That The Blood-Red Clouds Grow Pale, Now That No More The Trumpets Blowno More Beneath The-Fiery Hail Ochildren In Terror Come Andgo. Be This A Feast Of Hope I The Flowers Of Spring The Waste Of War Repair- The Quiet Work Of Happier Hours Dispels The Load Of Human Care For Industry And Art Are Powers That Know No End And No Despair. The Clwrale, A Smooth And Scholarly Piece Of Vocal Harmony, In The Key Of A Lati Was Extremely Waell Sung, And Furthereonfimcd Us Mn An Opinion Alwready Advanced, That Choral Music I3 Hikely More Thlan Any Other To Test Decisively The Acoustic Capabilities Of Albert Hall. Me. Gounods Motett, Entitled Gallia, As In Direct And Strong Contrast With The Foregoing. Signor Pinsuti Sings A Song Full Of Gratulation And Hope While M. Gounod, Until His Very Last Mnovement, Is All Sadness And Despondency. The Words Of Gallia Are Taken From Tileo Lamentations Of Jeremiah Chapter 1, Verses 1, 2, 4, And 12. The Maotett Is Published Both With The Latin Text From The Roman Catholio Bible And An English Translation Adapted From It, So As To Meet The Requirements Of Musical Rhythm. It Comprises An Orchestral Introduction And Chorus- Qtumodo Sedet Sola Civias Solitary Lieth The City, In The Key Of E Minor A Soprano Solo, In A Minor- Vis Siol Lu. Genft Tie Ways Of Zion Do Mourn A Chores, With Soprano Solo, In C- 0 Sos Omnes Qui Transitis Perianm All Ye That Pass By, The Second Section Of Which, Vie, Ldotnine, Afflictinemr Meane 0, Lord, Behold My Affliction, Brings Us Back To The Minor Key Of The Opening, And A Solo, Leading To A Chorus- Jesusamen I Jerusalem I Coi Wertere Ad Dominum Duentn Tuinen Jerusalem ! Jerusalem I Be Converted To The Lord Thy God, Which Is In The Major Key, And With Wonderful Briphtness, Dispels The Gloom Of Afl That Precedes It. We Have Hinted That Criticism Would Be Just Nowoutof Place But This Neednot Deter Us From Saying How Deeply M. Gounod Has Felt The Theme, Of His Own Hoice, How Tenderly And Beauti- Fully He Has Treated It, And How Hiis Music Is Suxeto Excite The Sympathies Of All Who Desire To See The Great Country Of Which He Is One Of The Most Distinguished Sons Restored To Its Normal Condition Of Honour, Prosperity, And Peace. What Gallia Meant Must Have Been Plain To Every Englishman, As To Every Frenchman, Yesterday. We Have Merely To Add That The Solos In The Motett Were Undertaken By Madame Conneau, Known In Parisian Circles As An Amateur Of Remarkable Ability That The General Performance, Under M. Gounods Own Direction, Was Admirable And Tlat The Reception Accorded Both To The Composer And His Work Was Of The Heartiest Poseible Kind. France Was Worthily Represented. The Grand March By Dr. Ferdinand Eiifler, Wtho Was Invited As A Inatter Of Cotuse To Represent Germany, Is A Composition Of Appropriate Brilliancy.. The Themes Are Vigorous, Rhythmical, And To The Purpose. The March Is In The Key Of D Major, With A Trio In A And Another In B Flat. The Execution By Tho Orchestra, Under The Direction Of The Eminent Composer Himself, Was All That Could Be Wished. Last, Not Least, England Was Represented, And, We May Add, Worthily Represented, By Mr. Arthur Suuivan, Who Contributed A Dramatic Cantata, Entitled On Slwre Awd Sea, The Plan And Character Of Which May Bo Best Explained By The Argument Supplied For The Programme By Mr. Tomrtaylor, Author Of The Words- The Action Passes On Shore At Ono Of The Many Small Seaports Dependent On Genoa, Such As Cogoletto, Or Camog, Ruta, Or Porto-Ferio-In Which Gaueys Were Manned Ana Tted Out For Her Service-And At Sea, On Board, First Of A Geneeso And Afterwards Of A Moorish Galley. The Cantata Opens With The Fleet Weighing Auchor To Tho Joyons Sonr Of The Sailors As They Heave At The Windlass And Spread The Sail, And The Lament Of Wives And Moters, Sisters And Sweethearts, Left Sorrowing Onshore. Then The Scene Changes To The Sea. Aboard One Of Tho Galeys, In The Midnight Watch The Thoughts And Prayers Of The Ayarine Go Back To The Ioyed Ones Left Behind, And Invoke For Them The Protection Of Our Lady, Star Of Tho Sea. Months Pass. The Scene Changes Again To The Shore. The Fleet, So Long And Anxiously Looked For, Shows On The Horizon, Aud The Crowd Flocks To The Port To Greet Its Triumphant Entry, Headed By The Yonag Wife Orniaiden Whose Fortunes The Cantata Fouows. But The Price Of Triumph Must Be Paid. The Galley Aboard Which Her Sailor Served Is Missing It Has Been Taken By The Rovers. Her Beloved Is Captive Or Slain. She Gives Expression To The Desolation Amid The Sympathizisg Sorrow Of Her Companions. Herlover,However, Is Notslain, But A Slave, Toiling At The Oar Uuder The Lash Of His Moorish Captors. He Plans A Rising On The Rovers, And While They Are Celebratinogtheir Triumphs With Song And Feasting, Possesses Himself Of The Key Of The Chain To Whicb, As It Ran From Stem To Stern Of These Gaueys, Each Prisoner Was Secured, And Exhorts His Fellow-Prisoners To Strike For Their Liberty. The Galley Slaves, After Encouraging Each Other To The Enterprise While They Toil At The Oar, Rise On Their Captors, Master The Galley, And Steer Homewards. Re-Entering The Port They Are Welcomed By Their Beloved Ones Sorrow Is Turned To Rejoicing, And The Cantata Ends With A Chorus Expressing The Blessedness Of Peace. The Music Of Mr. Sullivan Is Full Of Interest, But The Work Is Of Too Great Importance To Be Dismissed In The Few Lines Which Just Now Are All Which Ve Can Possibly Devoteto It. It Comprises No Less Than Eight Choruses, Togethor Witlh Reoitatives And Airs For Soprano And Bass Voices, And More Than One Orchestral Interlude, As Atriking And Characteristic As The Rest. In Certain Parts Of The Cantata The Young Composer Has Employed The Strange Intervals Which Distinguish The Oriental, And Especiauy The Turkish And Egyptian, Styles Of Melody. He Has Done This Moreover, With Eminent Success, Because He Has Done Itin Such A Way That Genuino Music Is Never Kept Out Of Mind. From The Brief Orchestral Introduction, Which Usher3 In The Opening Chorus Of Sailors, To The End There Is Always Something To Invite Attention And, In Fact, Hardly One Of The Ten Numbers Into Which The Canttata Is Divided Can Be Set Aside As Unworthy Special Notice. Mr. Sullivan Himself Conducted The Performance, Whiceh Was Received With High Favour, And, What Is More, Thoroughly Deserved It. The Solos Were Allotted To Madame Lemmens-Sherrington And Mir. Winn. After The Cantata The Overture To Rossinis Semir Ramidc Was Played, Under Sir Michael Costas Direction, With The Same Perfection As At The Second Concert Given By The Society Of Arts, Though, Coming So Late In The Programme, It Scarcely Excited The Same Enthusiasm. The National Anthem, For Chorus And Orchestra, Brought The Concert To An End. It Should Be Addedthat The Whole Of Themusical Arrangements Were Confided To The Directors Of The Sacred Harmonic Sooiety, Whieh Alone Would Account For The Excellence Of The Chorus Just As The Presidence Of Sir Michael Costa Woula Account For The Excellence Of The Orchestra.

Knoedlers Galleries, 15, Old Bond-Street, Is The Taste And Tact With Which The Artist Has Applied His Comparatively Limited Powers Of Execution To Scenes And Subjects Which Have Interested Hini. 1Painted In Oil In A System Of Judiciously Modified Pointillism In Light Schemes Of Colour--With Grey, Lilac, Aid Lavender Predotninatingthe Pictures Are Most Successful In The Rendering Of Space And Atmosphere. They May Be Said To Make Space Decorative. Mr. Carstairss Limitations As A Draughtsman Come Out In His Treatment Of Trees, But So Long As He Is Dealing With Regular Shapes, Such As Houses And Bridges, He Does Not Betray Them, And The North Bridge, Ihushukwan And A Dye Shop, Euchow, With The Fabrics Hanging Like Nets From A Bamboo Framework, Are Two Of The Best Of His Chinese Pictures. The Japanese Pictures Are Mostly In A Series Representing Cherry Blossom In The Early Morning Mist, And In Them The Veiled Forms Of Wooded Hills Are Well Suggested, With Great Charm Of Colour. By Dint Of Careful Simplicity In Drawing And Wise Reliance On The Intrinsic Decoration Of Costume Mr. Carstairs Has Made A Good Portrait Of A Manchu Priicess In Wedding Dress. But What Really Makes His Exhibition Attractive Is The Intelligence With Which He Has Recognized And Adapted His Powers To Subject Matter Of A Special Kind. Drawings Of 1Taly. Without Being Imitative In Style Or Closely Topographical In Subject, The Water-Colours And Drawings Of Italy By Mr. Kenneth Hobson At The Cotswold Gallery, 59, Frith-Street, Soho-Square, Have A Simplicity, Gravity, And Restraint Which Remind One A Good Deal Of The Early Mnasters Of The British School, J. R. Cozens In Particular. The Impression Given Is Not That Mr. Hobson Has Deliberatelycomposed His Mind And Limited His Palette, But That He Is Naturally Serious And Reflective And Finds Simple Means The Best For Expressing His Deep Interest In The Subjects. One Proof Of His Freedom From Pose Is His Ability To Unbend Wvhen The Subject Suggests A Looser And More Atmospheric Treatment, As In The Delightfujl Drawing Of A Sunilit Wll, A Wayside Shrine, Fraseati. Most Of The Drawings Are Of Architecture Closely Associated With Rocky Formations Of Ground, And It Is In His Treatment Of The Relations Between The Twvo That Mr. Hobson Displays His Skill As A Draughtsman. Keepinig Pretty Close To The Facts, And Withouit Being Ostentatiously Structural, He Gets The Effect Of A Unified Mass By Consistency In The Style Of Draw- Ing And Tact In Placing The Waslhes. With L The Drawing Named, Rome From The Pincio, Rocca Di Papa And Monte Cavo, And Monte Compatri And The Roman Campagna May Be Picked Out As Illustrating His Range. The Victorians. Mr. Osbert Sitwells Remarks On The Etchings Of The Late Queen Victoria In The Exhibition Of Them And Other Victorian Pictures And Objets Dart At The Broolstreet Art Gallery Are To Be Read As Written, But It Is True That Her Majesty Had Not Only General Artistic Talent But A Personal Style. A Celestial Choir And H.R.H. Princess Alice And Her Nurse, To Name Two Of The Best Original Etchings, May Not Be Drawn Perfectly By Academic Standards, But They Are Definitely Drawnv, With Selection From The Facts According To The Nature Of The Medium, And Clear And Decisive Statement. In Artistic, As Distinct From Romantic, Interest They Are Far Superior To The Works Of The Prince Consort Or By Him And The Queen In Collaboration. They Are, In Fact, Distinctly Modernist In Flavour. Altogether This Is A Most Entertaining Exhibition. It Contains A Good Many Things Of Which The Interest Is Chiefly Historical Or Circumstantial, Such As The Glass And Mother-Of-Pearl Pictures, The Fragment Of H.M. Queen Victorias Wedding Cake And The Rare Purple Bristol Glass Vase -Technically Perfect, But In Shape And Colour Suggesting A Jelly Infused With A Cheap Port Wine But, On The Other Hand, There Are A Few First-Rate Works Of Art, Those Whose Ideas About W. P. Frith Are Based Exclusively On Engravings Of Paddington And Time Derby Day Will Learn Something Fresh About His Powers As A Painter From The Hungerford Bridge Omnibus, And As A Composer From English Merry-Making In The Olden Time And There Are Slcetches By Wilkie, Faed, Leech, And Millaisincluding A Pencil Drawing Of The Head Of Sir Isumbras.

Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1928-Dec-17,"London, England","Art Exhibitions. A New Gallery To Judge From Its Opening Exhibitionpaintings By Renoir And Other Modern Artists-And Situation-3, Grosvenorsfreet-The New Paul Guillaume Gallery, Conducted By M. Paul Guillaume, The Wellknown Picture Dealer Of Paris, And Mr. F3Randon Davis, A Collector Who Makes His First Venture In Dealing, Intends To Pursiue A Definite Policy. Exhibitions Of Conteniporary English Art Are Promised, But All Tile Circumstances Combine To Suggest That The Emphasis Will Be Put Upon Works With Acquired As Well As Intrinsic Values. The Gallery Has Been Converted, By Mr. A. Lovell Knight, From A Private House, And The Rooms Are Well Lighted And Soberly Decorated In A Style Wliich Suggests An Atmosphere Conducive To Quiet Consideration Of The Works Displayed. There Are No Fewer Than 35 Paintings And 14 Drawings By Renoir, And In Range Of Period And Style It Appears To Be The Most Representative Exhibiition Of Him That We Have Had. By This Time Renoirs, Importance In The History Of French Tainting Is Beyond Question, Though We May Still Be Allowed To Comment Upon The Characters Whioh Make Us Contemplate -His Work With Mixed Feelings. He Began His Life As A Painter On Porcelain, And The Experience Haunted His Work To The End. Throughout His Work There Is Felt A Confliot Between Sensuous And Formal Quali,Ties-As If He Were Aiming At A More Intellectual Conduct Of The Pieture Than Really Suited His Instincts-And Again And Again In Looking At His Works One Is Reminded Of The Enlarged China Painting. At The Same Time It Is Clear That His Desire For A Monumental Treatment Of -Form Was Quite Genuine It Is Only That He Did Not Appear To Be Able To Make The Necessary Sacrifice Of What May Be Called Substantial Qualities-Colour, Texture, And Surface As Delights In Themselves, The Result Is Rather Like Having Peche Melba Served Up In A Dish Which Presupposes Carvingand Beyond A Certain Scale There Is Too Much Peche Melba. Renoirs Plastic Feeling Is Undeniable He Approaches Rubens In His Nioulding Of Rounded Forms Into A Unified Composition, But He Lacks The Bones That One Felt In Even The Most Billowy Picture By The Flemish Master And His Treatment Of Hands, With Their Sudderi Tapering From A Plump Wrist, Must Eyacite Painful, Memories In Anybody Who Siiffered From Chilblains In Youtil The Great Attraction In His Work Is Its Innocent Enjoyment Of Material Beauties -Of Woomen, Children, And Flowers-And One Of The Most Completely Satisfying Paintings In The Present Exhibition Is That Of A Little Boy, Portrait Of Jean. .The Most Important As A Composition Is Portrait Of Colonna Romano, Seated On A Sofa Against A Red Wall, With Picture Frames Playing A Part In The Rhythm Of The Design, And There Are Some Interesting Self-Portraits, Including One Of The Artist As A Young Man. The Drawings Are Particularly Welcome Because They Show Renoir Without His Material. Seduetions-Not That The Seductions Are To Be Regretted In Themselves On The Contrary, They Are.To Be Enjoyed But That, In The Paintings, They Are Too Often Felt To Be The Urong Context-S If You Were Offered Strawberries And Cream At A Solemn Occasion... You Curse The Occasion, Not The Strawberries And. Cream. In The Drawings Everything Is Consistent, And The Sacrifice Of Character To Mass Explains Itself. Mother And Children, At Any Rate, Would Bear Comparison With Rubens. The Paintings By Other Artists Inelude A Very, Fine - C6Zanne Landscape, Le Tholomnet, -A Middle-Period Corot, Landscapq Near Etampes, Both Firm And Atmospheric, A Lovey Snow Scene, By Sisley, And Several Eiarnples Of The Elegant Art Of Matisse. In A Place Of Honour There Is An Enchantig Picture Of The Wedding, By Henri Rousseau The Douanier,. Itshowwhat Happens When Yoducommiission A Portrait Group From A Genuine Awrtist. The Sporting Gallery. Being Illustrations, 3R. Ernest Il Shepards Original Drawings, Exhibited At The Sporting Gallery, 32, King-Street, Covent Garden, For The - House, At Pooh Corner And Mr. Punchs County Songs Are Chiefly Of Psychological Interest. In The Illustrations To Mer.. A. A. Milnes Stories Mr. Shnpardcchowa A Remarkable Aptitude In Giving A Human Expression To Animals, And His Pigs, Rabbits, And Other Animals Are, If Possible, Even More Expressive Than The Children Which Accompany Them. Mr. Shepards Children To Some Extent Remind One Of Fashion Plates-Though Of Course His Drawing Is Much More Competentin That They All Achieve The Same Sort Of Elegance, The Same Charm, And Even Appear To Be To Some Extent Aware Of The Social Position With Which This Kind Of Charm Atrees. Flow Mr. Shepard So Unfailingly Contrves To Suggest A Complete Social Milieu, And Even To Throw Light Upon Its Standards, In Drawings So Slight As These Is Indeed Mysterious. His Draw- Ings For Mr. Punchs County Songs, Are More Elaborate And Consequently Even Mnore Expressive Of The Aspirations Which Are So Ingeniously Aduinbrated In His Drawings Of Children. Hr. Cecil Aldins Coaching Pictures At The Same Gallery Evoke With Equal Ingenuityand As Satisfactorily A Different Kind Of Romance, One More Objective And Remote From Human Needs, To Which He Gives The Title The Romance Of The Road. Coaches And Inns, Clay-Pipes, Beer, Winking Coachmen, And Regency Architecture Are The Constituents Of This ,Kinid Of Rozance, But What Is Interesting About Mr. Aldins Drawings Is That He Uses So Exactly -The Particular Technique, The Rather Loose Method Of Drawing, Which Experience Has Shown To Be Necessary For His Purpose.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS152248209/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=6666899c,,
Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1896-Oct-26,"London, England","Art Exrlitions. There Is Not Much That Is Distinctive In The Exhibition Of The Society Of British Artists In The Large Galleries In Suffolk-Street But Then One Hardly Expects It Nowadays In The Half-Yearlyidisplays In These Rooms. A Certain Novelty Is Lent By. The Eccenttic Productions Of Mr. J. W. T. Manuel, -Whose Work Tecalls The Curiosities That Were Common Here Under A Different Vrime A Few Years Ago But With This One Exception There Is Very Little That Compels Attention. A Certain Number Of Very Blue Sea-Pieces, A Grave Scotch Landscape By Mr. Tom Robertson 72, Pleasant In Colour Bat A Little Infirm In Handling, And One Chsracteristic Picture By Mr. Cayley Robinson Lre What Chiefly Remain In The Memory Of The Visitor After A Tour Of The Central Gallery. Mr. Cayley Robinson Is, As We Have Said More Than Once, An Interesting Painter, Who Combines With The Spirit Of The English Prm-Raphaelites A More Modem Feeling Derived Apparently From French Training. His Littlo Picture Of The Foundling, Were It Not For The Excessive Size Of The Childs Head, Would Be A Decided Success The Figure Of The Woman Who Is Making Ready The Bed Has A Curious Grace, And The Coloar Of The Whole Picture Is Charming After Its Quaint Fashion. But, As In All The Work Of The Men Upon Whom Mr. Robinson Seems To Model Himself-Madox Brown And Wir. Holman Hunt-There Is A Superfluity Of Detaii Which Is Perhaps Intended To Have A Mean- Ing, But Which Rather Hurts The General Effect. The Large Picturo Which Mr. R. U. W. Bunny Calls Ros 103 Is Decorative But Mysterious, And The Fisherman Who Is About To Throw His Net To Catch, Not The Fish, But, As It Would Seem, The Mnaiden Goddess Who Walks Scarcely Visible Upon The Water, Has A Co.Nic Effect, Which We Fear The Artist Never Intended. Mr. Simes Clever Portrait 185 Is Full Of The Newest And Least Attractive Of French Mannerisms Mr. J. E. Breuns 153 Is A Little Theatrical. There Is Excellent Intention Inthesymboliepicturewhich Hr. B.M Achell Calls Love, But The Painting Is Not So Good As The Design, And The Best Part Of The Picture Is Its General Decorative Conception And The Execution Of The Frame. The Large Room At The Fine Art Societys In New Bond-Street Is Now Filled With A Remarkable Collection Of Drawings Illustrating A Century And Sa Half Of English Rumorous Art From Hogarth To The Present Day, And To The Catalogue Of This Rather Ambitious Display An Historical Introduction Has Been Written By Mr. Joseph Grezo, A Gr3At Authority On The History Of The Grap-Hic Humourists. Of Course No More Than A Very Few Specimens Can Be Given Even Of The Chief Artists In So Long A Line, And We Can No More Judge Gillray And Rowlandson By A Few Sarnples Than We Can Judge Sir John Tenniel By The Cartoons Of Asingle Month. The Greatness Of A Humourist Often Lies In His Fertility What Made That Of Leech, For Example, Was His Wide Outlook Upon Life And His Power Of Going On Year After Year With Fresh Illustrations Of Its Follies And Its Foibles. Hcmour Is The Most Difficult Thing In The World To Sample Satisfactorily. Still, Space, At All Events In The Exhibition Room, Has Its Limits, And We Must Be Content Withwhat The Artists Themselves Would Have Thought And What The Living Ones Doubtless Think A Very Scanty Representation Of Their Talent. One Of The Old Caricaturists Who Comes Out Best From The Ordeal Is H. W. Bunbury, A Member Of The Well-Known Norfolk Family Which Will Always Bo Associated With The Names Of Reynolds, Goldsmith, And Their Circle. This Man Of Fashion, This Amateur Of Genius, Could Draw A Smart Crowd With A Charm Almost Equal To That Which Gainsborough Put Into His Picture Of The Mall, And A First-Rate And Well-Preserved Example Of His Talent Is Given Here In The Drawing Of The Garden Party At Carlton-House. Artistically This Is Perhaps The Most Important Drawing In The Rooni, But It Is Rather A Charming Picture Of Society Than A Satire Or A Caricature. We Pass From It To The Coarser And More Vigorous Art Of Rowlandson, To The Grim Satire Of The Cruikahanks, To The Interesting Set Of Original Illustrations For Pickwick Here Exhibited Together Upon A Screen, And Thence To The Men Of Our Own Day, The Men Who Week After Week Have Entertained Us In Punch. And Other Periodicals. Here Are A Few Exeulent Drawings By Du Maurier, To Remind Us Of A Loss We Shall All Feel For Many A Day Here Are Thinas By Mr. Linley Sambourne, Mr. F. C. Gould, Nr. B. T. Reed, Mir. Leslie Ward, And Many Another Favourite Of The Public. But Of These Men The Work Is So Familiar That No Description Of It Is Necessary It Is Enough To Say That The Selection Of It Is Interesting Both In Itself And As Affording A Means Of Comparison Between Styles And Points Of View. From The Genial Caricatures Of Well-Known Contemporarieswhich This Room Contains Itisa Curious Change To Pass To The Very Interesting Exhibition Of Paintings By Mr. Milure Ha Mlton At The Goupil Gallery, At The Bottom Of Resent-Street. Here, Too, Are Portraits Of Celebrities, Though Not Caricatures Lir. Gladstone In Several Aspects, Mr. Herbert Spencer, Professor Tyndall, Air G. F. Watts, Lord Leighton, Mr. Onslow Ford, And Several Other People, All Invested With Life In An Extraordinary Degree And With That Quality Of Instantaneousness In Which Scarcely Any Contemporary Artist Can Rival Mr. Hamilton. The Artist Has A Method All His Own He Paints So Thinly As Scarcely To Cover The Canvas, Andgzives, Except In Lord Leightons Portrait, Almost The Effect Of Monochrome. But This Slightness Is Only Apparent In Reality The Heads Are Most Carefully Modelled And The Likeness In Almost Every Case Is Singularly Vivid. The Largo P Icture Called In The Library At Hawarden . Is Really One Of The Most Veracious Of Existing Portraits Of 3Ir. Gladstone, And The Head Of Mir. Herbert Spencer Is Probably The Only Portrait Of That Philosopher That I At Al Satisfactory. Altogether This Little Exhibition Is Not One To Be Missed We Hope It Will Reveal To The Public At Large, What Has Long Been Known To The Painters, That Mr. Mlure Hamilton Is An Artist Of Very Unusual Talent In Portraiture. We Must Pass Over With A Single Word The Pleasant Exhibition, At The St. Georges Gallery In Grafton-Street, Of Landscapes By The Late M. Lipine, Who Is Described As The Pupil Of Corot And Who Certainly Was Greatly Influenced By Him And Also The Picture Exhibited With Much Parade And Mystery At Messrs. Dowdeswells Close By. This Is The Rabboni Of Mr. Herbert Schmalz . The Title Explains The Subject, And The Name Of The Artist Is A Sufficient Indication Of The Style In Which It Is Treated. Lastly, We May Direct Atteution To The Little Exhibition Of Old English Pictures To Be Seen In What Has Become Their Customary Home, Messrs. Shepherds Gallery In Kinc-Street, St. Jamess. Among A Number Of Small Cabinet Pictures-Genuine Sketches By Romney, Constable, David ,Ox, C.-There Stand Out Two Rather Remarkable Works Of Little-Known Painters, A Very Vigorous Portrait Of The Duke Of Wellington In Uniform By J. Simpson, A Pupil Of Sir Thomas Lawrence, And A Keminiscence Of The Last Montem At Eton By W. Parrott. This Picture, Which Was Exhibited At The Royal Academy In 1849, Is A Vivid Rendering Of A Scene Interesting To All Etonians And To All Readers Of Disraelis Novels. The Painter Is One Of Those Who Have Been Undeservedly Forgotten He Had A True Eye For English Landscape And For Sparkling Colour.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS100851546/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=e50b84bc,,

A Society Of Parson Painters Is In Itself An Interesting Fact, And That, And The Possibilities Suggested Rather Than Present Performance Make Noteworthy The First Exhibition Of The Society At Holy Trinity Church House, 204A, Reat Portland-Street. The Dean Of York, Who Is President Of The Society, Contributes Some Excellent Water-Colours Of Coast-Scenes, In Which-In Sands, Walberswick, In Particular-The Feeling Of Space As Contained Between The Receding Planes Of Eartli And Sky Is Very Well Suggested, And There Are Oil Paintiigs, Charming In Colour And Atmosphere, Of Scenes Abroad By Bishop Hamilton Baynes. The Strongest Impression, However, Is Made By The Gro Up Of Water-Colours By Mr. Mi. F. Foxell Clear And Simple, And Showing A Real Grasp Of Structural Principles In Both Landscape And Architecture. Wootton, Oxon, And - Puddle Dock Are- Particularly Good. Mr. Claude Torrey, Who Is Not Unknown In The Exhibiton World, Is Well Represented By Near Avranches, And The Seascapes In Oils By Mr. L. G.

Tooths And Mr. M.Leans, Are Thrown Open To The Public This Morning And Will Not, On The Whole, Disappoint Their Visitors. As Usual, The Strength Of Both Exhibitions Lies In The Work Of Foreign Artists, Though Certain Native Favourites Like Mr. Peter Graham, Mr. Leader, And Mr. W. L. Wyllie, Send Attractive Piectures,While At Mlessrs. Tooths A Central Place Is -Occupied By The Well-Known Besieged Of The Late Frank Holl. This Is One Of Those Somewhat Gloomiy Subjects In Which The Colebrated Painter Found So Much To Attract Him, And To Which, Strange To Say, He Was Always Regretting That His Incessant Engagements As A Portrait Painter Did Not Allow Him To Return. It Is Not On Them But On His Portraits That His Falme Will Rest, And Yet His Treatment Of These Subjects Allowed Him To Display That Skilful Use Of Strongly-Contrasted Light And Shade Which Was One Of The Distinguishing Marks Of His Painting. Other Pictures On Which The Strength Of The E-Hibition Depends Are Le Pardon-Bretagne, By Dagnan-Bouveret 56, And La Jeune Favorite, By That Extremely Skilful Painter Of Eastern Subjects, L. Deutsch, Both Of Them Works -Hich Made A Mark In-The Last Salon. The Latter Is A Sort Of Subject That G4Rome Used To Paint In His Best Days The Young Girl With Her Two Black-Robed Duennas Is Passing Into The Harem Before A Line Of Black Mutes In White Dresses Aird Wvhite Turbans, Drawn Up Against The Wvall. It Would Be Hard To Surpass The Technical Perfection Of This Work The Painting Of The Negroes Faces, Of The Purple-Blue Carpet And The Soft Matting, Of The Yellow Robe Of The Chief Eunuch, Is Just As Fine As It Can Be, And It Is Only Because G4R6Me And Charles Bargue And A Few Others Have Already Familiarized Us With The Style Of Painting That Such Work Does Not Make A Sdnsation. A Small Picture In The Ante-Room By M Weisse Is Equal In Quality To The Works Of Deutscli In Fact, There Are At The Present Time At Least Four Or Five Men Painting In Paris Who Can Achieve These Striking Effects Of Eombined Brieadth And Finish. -Mn. Daguan-Bouveret Is Of A Different Sort He Is Knowinfor Pictures Of Moaedern European Life, Serious In Tone And Strong In Treatmnent. This Time He Has Gone To The Land Which -Pierre Lotis Novels Have Made Familiar To So Many, And Has Painted A Few Figures Out Of A Breton Religious Procession. The Heads Are Wonderfully Modelled The Old White-Haired Man Who Looks As If He Might Have Fought With The Chouans, The Younger Man With Narrow Forehead And Pursed Lips, The. Typa Of The Peasant Bigot, The Happy-Looking Elder-Women And The Beautiful Girls-All These Areo Realized With Extraordinary Force And Haimonized. Into A Fino Picture. Another Work Which Ranks With These Two Is The Sunny Moments Of C. Bisschop, The Well-Known Dutch Painter An Altogether Charming Picture Of A Young Girl Standing Near A Window Through Which The Light Pours In Upon A Splendid Oriental Tablecloth Such As The Old Dutch Artists Loved To Paint. This Is By Far The Best Example Of Bisschops Work That Has Been Seen In London For Some Time. Last Among The Foreign Pictures We May Notice Le Veillee, By Lieerbaitte, An Agreeable Variation From His Usual Manner - The Stirrup Cup, A Very Clever And Attractive Example Of Rafaelle Sorbi, And The Cardplayers, A Work Of Bleissonier, Dated 1872. There Is A Certain Crudity Of Colour In The Contrast Between The Bright Red Brick-Work And The Blue A-Nd Green Coats Of The Players, But The Modelling Is As Masterly As Meissoniers Work Invariably Is, And T,He Picture Wvill Certainly Make A First-Rate Engraving. Of The Ienglish Pictures, As We Said, There Are Many That Are Wvell Up To The Painters Tsual Mark, But We Need Onl7 Call Special Attention To The Stratford Locki Of Mr. B. W. Leader, Not Because It Is A Particularly Good Picture, But Because It Has Been Beautifully Etched By Chauvel. The Etching Makes A Capital Companion To The Summer Showers Of Mr. Vicat Cole, A Picture Which Hung In This Very P Lace A Year Ago. The Landscapes Of Mr. Davidfarquharson And Some Small Flower Pieces By Miiss Ada N3Ell Are Also Noticeable. What Strikes One Flrst In Mr. Mleans Exhibition Is The Number Of Landscape And Cattlo Scenes That He Has Brought Together In Fact, Save For These And One Or Two Pictures Of Horses And Dogs There Would Be But Little In The Gallery. Rosa B3Onheur, Van Mareke, His Daughter Madame Dieterle, Charles Jacque, Schreyer, Yates Carrington, L. B. Hult, And The Spanish Paintel 31Anocal-All These Have Contributed Pietures Of Animal Life, So That The Gallery May Be Said To Contain An Epitome Of The Works Of Most Of The Best Animal Painters Now Living. The Gem Of The Collection Is Rosa Bonheurs Pasturage In The Pyrenees, Picture Fresh From Her Easel, And A Truly Marvellous Example Of Her Power. A Group ,Of Cattle Sutrounding A Magnificent Dun Lull Are Standing Or Lying About On The Top Of A Pyrenean Pass Amid The Bushes Of Alpenrose If That Name Is Appropriate When Thre Shrub Grows In The 0Pyrenees. Beyond, Throiigh Air Of Wonderful Clearness,Thedistant Peaks Are Visible, And Between Ithem And Us The Pastures Are Dotted With More Icattle, Smooth-Haired Cousins Of Our Own Fiercelooking Highland Breed. Miiademoiselle Bonheur S As Remalkable For Her Tact As For Her Painting Ishe Seldom Or Never Tries Effects In Which The Special Qualities Of Her Art Do Not Appear To Tadvartage. The Melancholy Of The Northern Tmarshes, Misty And Sombre, Is Not For Her Let Ivan Miarcke Find Poetry There ! The Beautiful Glades Of Fontainebleau, The Sunny Fallows Of The Nivernais, The Glowing Pyrenean Heights Are Twhat She Delights In. And Of All Her I-Yrenean Pictures This One Before Us Is Probably The Best, Lassuming That This Extraordinary Enamelled Work, This Jewel-Like Finish, Is A Legitimate Excellence Of Painting. The Other Animal Painters Are Fairly Represented Van Marcke Perhaps Least Satisfactorily. The Large Schreyer And Its Smaller Replica Are Brilliant, And Mr. Carringtons Pair Are Not Only Amusing, But They Are Painted Wvith A Strong Sense Of Colour. Senor 3Ranocal Like All The Other Spanish Painters Of The Day, Treads In The Stepa Of Fortuny The 2Ittle Sketch From His Hand Here Exhibited 26 Is Lfull Of Ability.

BY OUR ART CRITIC,The Chinese Art Exhibition,The Times,1935-Nov-29,"London, England","Entertainments The Chinese Art Exhibition Rhythm Of Space By Our Art Critic Asked What Was The Most Striking Effect In Music, Beethoven Is Reported To Have Said No Music Meaning, It May Be Supposed, The Measured Rest Of So Many Beats Or So Many Bars Through Which The Rhythm Goes On Silently To Become Audible In The Next Chord. Translated Into Visual Terms, This, The Rhythm Of Eloquent Spaces, Is One Of The Characteristic Effects Of Chinese Painting, And It May Be Observed At The Royal Academy Not Only In The Sung Landscapes But Even In Such A Late Work As The Seventeenthcentury Screen 1,672 In The Big Room. The Spaces Betaveen The Cranes Are Not Empty But Filled With The Implication Of Their Movernent, And Even When Movement Itself Is Not Represented There Is The Same Effect, As Between A Group Of Trees And A Mountain Peak, And The Movement Of The Eye From One To The Other Is Part Of The Appreciation Intended. Before Looking At The Paintings It Might Be Well To Go Into The Smaller Of The South Rooms To See The Examples Of Calligraphy Displayed There, Such As Nos. 3,041 And 3,073, Because Chinese Painting Is A Brush-Writing Of The Mental Conceptions Of The Artist. It Might Be Incorrect To Say That Painting Was Derived Historicalty From Calligraphy, But Both Were Commonly Done By The Same Person-The Chinese Characters Themselves Being A Sort Of Shorthand Of Pictorial Ideas. As Good A Painting As Any To Begin Upon Is The Scroll Of The Hundred Geese 1,387, By Ma Fen Late Eleventh Century, Not Because It Is The Finest In Poetical Mood But Because It Shows To Perfection Both The Style Of Execution And The Eloquent Spaces Of The Chinese Artist. As Indicated By The General Direction Of The Geese, You Are Supposed To Begin On The Right, The Scroll Being Unrolled Gradually And Read Like A Poem. It Is Almost A Pity That The Scroll Could Not Be Shown That Way, To Provide The Succession Of Thrills As Each New Incident Came Into View. Nothing Is Represented But Geese, In An Infinite Variety Of Movement, And Bamboos, Standing Out Or Disappearing Into Misty Air, But There Is Never The Effect Of Empty Space. At One Point The Geese Are Shown Flying In File, As If To Sober Down The Excitement Caused By Their Actions, Diving, And So On. The Whole Thing Is A Masterpiece Of Impressionist Notation In Ink, In Nervous Touches, As If It Were Done At A Sitting In A Mood Of Intense Excitement. Scroll Paintings From This, And From The Other Scroll A Myriad Miles Of The Yangtze 1,127, By Hsia Kuei Active C. A.D. 1180-1230, Which Is More Placid In Mood, It Seems As If Unity In A Chinese Painting Were An Affair Of General Mood, And Images In Succession With Implied Links Between Them-Almost As If The Time Element Wvere Includedrather Than Of The Ordered, And Often Symmetrical, Composition With Which The Word Is Associated In European Art. Not All The Paintings Are Scroll Paintings, But Even In The Hanging Pictures A Sirnilar Kind Of Attention Seems To Be Asked For. You Stand Comparatively Close To The Picture, Give Yourself Up To Its Mood-Of A Serene Solemnity In Boating By Moonlight 1,163, And Of Something More Expectant In A Mountain After Rain 1,091, To Name Two Of The Finest Examples-While You Read The Subject. In Both These Paintings, In The Drop From The Mountain I To The Low-Rlaced Boat In The Former, And In The Ascent From The Trees To The Peak In The Latter, The Music Of Space Helps To Con- I Dition The Mood. Otherparticularly Fine Paintings Are Landscape With Palace Pavilions 1.000, More Architectural In Composition Than Is Usual The Kao Kao Pavilion 1,040, With Very Free Brushwork Two Horses 1,116, With The Soliditv Bv Contour Which Was Noticed In Th1E Tang Fragments And Mountain Landscape 1,207. Sculpture Disregarding History, Which Ought To Be Studied From Books, It Looks As If The Roots Bf Chinese Sculpture Were In The Early Bronzes, Jades, And Stone Carvings. The Chunky,, Buffalo 268,, Which Dates From The Shang-Yin Dynasty ? 1766-? 1122 B.C., Otherwise Nobody-Knows-When, Is A Good Starting Point. But In Most Of The Early Works The Forsrn, When They Are Not Df Abstract Pattcrns, Are Strongly Stylizedwith Tantalizing Hintsof Scythian, Pacific And Central American Affinities. -Gradually Mgore Nlaturalistic Animals And Figures Emerge, To Reach Perfection In The Tang Tomb Statuettes In The Lecture Room. Figure Sculpture Proper Comes With Buddhism, By What -Looks Like Greek Influence Via India, Absorbing The Riper Forms By The Wvay. What Strikes One At Once Is The Much Sharper Distinction Between Painting And Sculpture In China Than In Europe, As If The Solid Material Were The Raiso,T Dc,Re Of Sculpture. Reference To The Great Buddha, In The Central Hall, And Buddhist Priest, Holding Lotus 2,393, In The Lecture .Room,.Shows That The Figure Itself Is Conceived Very S6Lidly, While The Folds Of The Draperv Are Written Upon It, So To Speak, In More Stylized Lines And Curves Than-In Greek Sculpture, Recalling, Indeed, French Romanesque. There Is An Interesting Comparison Between No. 2,393 And The More Freely Modelled Temple Guardian 2,394 Beside It The Latter Seeming To Show The Native Chinese Movement Towards What We Should Call A Gothic Manner. In The Delightful Kuan-Vin 1,299. In Gallery Vi., It Has Reached The Full Baroque, And Throughout The Exhibi Tion There Seems To Be A Conflict Between Classical Rigidity -And Romantic Freedom. But In All The Buddhistic Sculpture, In The Exceedingly Beautiful Kuan-Yin 860, In Gallery Iv., For Example, One Cannot Fail To Be Struck By The Effect Of Calm Radiating From The Figures, Which Is Not Entirely Due To Tacial Expression..",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS201928061/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=e23b1a0c,,

Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1910-Feb-07,"London, England","Art Exhibitions. Modern Society Of Portrait Painters. - J . We Could Gladly Dispense With Half The Picture Exhibitions Now Open In The West-End Of London But The Modem Society Of Portrait Painters Is Not Among Those That Would Go. It Has Youth And Vitality And Abundance Of Talent. Moreover, It Is Not Only Progressive In Tendency, But, What Is Much More To The Point, Many Of Its Individual Members Are Making Progress. Among The 47 Portraits Many Of Them Full-Lengthsin The First Room Of The Royal Institute Galleries, And Among The 38 In The Second, There Are Several Failures, Several Freaks, And Several Clever Uglinesses But There Are A Dozen Original Works Which Prove That The Young English School Of Portrait Painting Is Very Much Alive. The Success Of The Year Is The Work Of Mr. Glyn Philpot, Who Passes In It From Promise To Performance Of A Remarkable Kind. His Manuelito, The Circus Boy, A Full-Length Of A Handsome Lad In Gay Spanish Costume, Is Quite The Most Striking Modern Picture Now Exhibiting In London, And Is Quite Worthy Of The Attention Of The Chantrey Trustees. Of Course, Every Young Painter Is Influenced By Somebody, And Mr. Philpot Has Been Influenced By Manet But This Picture Is As Strong As A Manet, And Far More Agreeable. There Is Much Ability Also In The Same Painters The Stage Box, Though Here The Two Figures Are Of A Decadent Type, And The General Effect Is Not Pleasing. Mr. Gerald Kelly, Another Painter Who Has Been Making Way, Must Look To His Colour Schemes And Backgrounds, Which This Year Are A Little Muddy. Much More Successful Is The Apache, By Mr. Oswald Birley, A Portrait In Character Of That Clever Actfress Miss Beatrice Collier. It Is Said That This Picture Was Rejected From The Academy Which Only Proves Once More That A Salon Des Refuses Would Often Contain Some Of The Best Things Of The Year. Mr. Louis Ginnetts Miss Eva Russell6 Young Girl With A Fishing Rod Mr. Ronaldsons Charming Portrait Of The Daughter Of Mr. R. H. Benson Mr. Crealocks Mrs. Aird And The Portraits Of Ladies By Mr. Lindhd And Mr. Sholto Douglas Are Excellent In Their Way And Mark An Advance On The Part Of Each Of The Artists. But The Vast Salomfi Of Mr. Ranken, Clever As It Is. Gives Little Pleasure. It Is Called S Portrait Of The Princesse X. A Strange Princess, To Wish Herself Painted In This Character, End On This Scale! In The Second Room The Portraits Of Ladies By Mr. Mark Mflbanke And Mr. Guy Wilthew, End Mr. Studds Whistlerian Two Children Ere Noteworthy, Es Are The Rather Extravagant Tours De Force Of Mr. Cadell But The Chief Picture In The Room Is His Majesty The King, By Mr. G. W. Lambert. This, Representing The King In Uniform, Standing By His Horse, Is The Largest And Most Ambitious Performance As Yet Attempted By This Very Clever Artist But He Has Kept The Tone Of The Face So Low That The Picture Cannot Be Called A Complete Success. The Drawings By Mr. Lambert, Mr. Ronald Gray, And Others, In The Next Room, Terminate In An Interesting Way An Exhibition Which Illustrates Very Fully The Tendencies Of The Time In Portraiture. The Ridley Art Club. . The 24Th. Exhibition Of This Club Is Being During This Week At The Grafton Gallery. We Held Fear That It Will Not Draw The Crowds Who Flocked To The Loan Collection, But It Is Large And Comprehensive, And Contains Among Its 263 Numbers A Fair Allowance Of Presentable Works, Not All Of Them New. Mr. And Mrs. Bedford, Miss Atkinson, Miss Beatrice Bland, Mr. E. H. Macandrew, Miss Emma Belloc, Mr. Dacres-Adams, And Mr. Richard Jack Are Among Tho Painters Whose Work Is Good And Often Impressive. But, Except For The Satisfaction Of The Members And Their Friends, It Is Not Easy To Discover Raison Tlre-Tar The Exhibition. There Are Too Many Such Already. ... ? Mr. William Shackleton. . It Is Otherwise With Tho Show Of Mt. Shackletons Pictures And Drawings At The Goupil Gallery. Here Is An Artist Of Very High Accomplishment, And, If The Phrase Be Allowed, Of Marked, But Partly Borrowed, Individuality. That Is To Say, Mr. Shackleton Has So Steeped Himself In Turner That He Often Allows His Own Originality To Be Obscured By That Of The Greater Man Though There Are Times When, Partly By Choice Of Subject And Partly By The Treatment, He Appears In An. Independent Light. There Is, For Instance, Nothing Of Turner In The Pencil Studies, And Very Little In The Sketches Of Figures Such As The Little Gleaner, Or In Certain Pictures Where The Figure Is The Dominating Element, Such As Children On The Sea-Shore, Painted Ten Years Ago. Indeed, If One Were To Be Content With The Interesting Preface To The Catalogue Written By The Artist, One Might Suppose That Turner Counted For Nothing He Is Never Mentioned, Mid Instead We Have The Outlines Of A Private Esthetic Philosophy, Vague, As Are The Words Of Nearly All Painters When They Try To Account For The Faith That Is In Them, But Quite Sincerely Felt, Mr. Shackleton Insists That Life Is What Interests Him But His Pictures Tell Us That It Is A Lose Transfigured By Blaring Sunlight, A Glowing Atmosphere, And Colours Scarcely Of This World. Often His Figures Are Of Little Account It Is The Landscape And The Atmosphere That Tell. But Turner, Too, Imagined That In His Radiant Visions Ho Was Philosophizing Upon Life. The Interpretation Never Counted For Much, But The Pictures Remain, A Joy For Ever. So We Will Not Follow Mr. Shackleton Into His Commentaries Upon His Phryne At Eleusis And Other Pictures But Enjoy Them, And Commend Them, As Really Brilliant Exercises Ot Imagination And Also Of Technique. Some Of The Water-Colour Sketches Are Lovely.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS185662023/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=ddfb4f27,,
Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1939-Feb-18,"London, England","Art Exhibitions Mr. Moores Drawings For Sculpture There Can Be No Question That Mr. Henry Moore Has A Highly Developed Sense Of Form In The Abstract, And The Present Exhibition Of 31 Drawings For Sculpture By Him At The Mayor Gallery, 19, Cork Street, Is Well Worth Study From The Point Of View Of Formal Research. As A Rule Mr. Moore Gives Most Satisfaction At Extremes When He Conducts His Researches Fairly Close To Life, Or When He Carries Them Towards The Condition Of Architecture But In His Least Explicable Distortions His Forms Are Never Felt To Be Empty Of Life. His Use Of Colour To Reinforce Form Is So Apt That One Would Like To See Paintings By Him. Possibly The Most Interesting Works In This Exhibition Are The Sheets Of Studies Nos. 14, 15, 18, And 19. In Them His Preference For A Unit Of Form Which May Be Described As A Round Square Is Evident. It Is Similar To That Which Gives Masculine Energy To The Ornament On Ancient Chinese Bronzes, As Aiso To Chinese Calligraphy, And The Suggestion Of Depth By Tones Of Colour Is Admirable. Other Powerful Designs Are Drawing For Metal Sculpture 7 And Reclining Figures Red 28.

Seer From Close By, His Pictures Appear To Be Mere Collections Of Coarse, Square Brush-Marks, Thrown Together Anyhow But As One Recedes To The Proper Distance, All These Till Into Their Place, The Juxtaposed Colours Fuse Into Something Different From Any Of Them, Tone Is Relieved Against Tone, And The Total Offset Is The Beautiful Harmony Of Nature.

In The Little Exhibition Of Venice Intwilight And At Night, Winch Opens Tins Morning At The Goupil Gallery, There Are Many Examples Of This Latter Achievoxaent. Take For Example The Picture Called Vhorloge, Place Saint-Marc 4. From The Middle Of The Room The Wall Looks White, A Delightful Ivory White But As You Come Close You See That It Is Pink, Bine, Yellow. Again, Tire Posts In Le Grand Canal, Clair De Luns 1, Are, If One Smells The Picture In The Way That Sir Godfrey Kntiler Forbede, Blurred With The Buildings In The Background. Ten Feet Away, They Are As Sharply Defined As If A Pen Had Drawn Their Outlines. In His Management Of Colour, Indeed, M. Le Sidauer Is Highly Remarkable And It Would Not Be Too Much To Say That Hobodynowpainting Has A More Complete Mastery Of Delicate Twilight Effects. His Pictures Want Quiet Room And A Wall To Themselves. Garish Neighbours Ox Strong Sunlight Would Spoil Them. But Under Favonrabla Conditions The Best Of Them, Like This Clair De Lune, Are Lovely. Wo Should Add That The Exhibition Contains Only Seven Finished Pictures And A Few Studiestire Latter Not Very Remarkable, Forwithm. Le Sidaner Finish Is Everything. But It Is Finish In The Sense That The Modern Artists Give To The At The Modem Gallery, 61, New Bond-Street, There Is An Exhibition Of No Fewer Than 186 Water-Colour Drawings By Miss Edith Martineau, Ab.W.S, And Her Sister, Miss Gertrude Martineau. They Represent The Work Of Several Years, And In One Or Two Cases The Date Of A Drawing Goes Back To The Eighties. Varied As Is The Character Of The Exhibition, Comprising Figures, Landscapes, Gardens, And Special Studies Of Flowers, Its Title Rightly Indicates That The Highlands, And Especially Aviemore, Have Famished And Autumns Which They Spent There With Their Eminent Father, The Late Dr. Mhrtinean, Gave Him The Leisure To Write Philosophy And Them The Leisure To Practise, And The One Has Tried To Capture The Fleeting Effects Of Sunlight On The Moors And Of Tire Passage Of Tire Cloud-Shadowy Across The Mountains And The Other, With X Success To Which The Exhibitions Of Tire Royal Water Colour Society Have Often Borne Witness, Has Preferred The Wealth Of Flowers End Foliage Of A Scotch Garden In June Or Early, Autumn. Miss Edith Martincan Has A Real Talent For Flower Painting, Whether In Direct Studies Like The French Poppies 85 And Carnations 96, Or In Masses And Borders, Such As Those Shown In The Drawing Calledlavish June 32. Soma Of Her Figures, Especially Those Of Children 70, Are Also Very Accomplished Examples, Though Of A Careful And Minute Method Not Much Practised By The Painters Of The Day. Other Exhibitions Of Drawings Xhs Given By Mx. Frank Wasley Mendosa Gallery, Bond-Street, Mr. Dacres Adams Patersons, 5, Old Bondstreet, And The Barones H. Von Cramm Graves, Pall-Mall. The Lastnamed Artist, Who Seems To Have Travelled Everywhere, Is Happy In Her Renderings Of Soft Grey Lakes. Mr. Wasley Is Too Emphatic Ho Shonld Remember That Imagination Is Effective Only When The Expression Of It Is Kept Under Restraint. Mr. Adams Is In Many Ways A Charming Artist, With A Gift For The Illustration Of Fairy-Tiles And A Word Should Bo Said In Praise Of His Sisters Bookbindings, Which Are Shown In The Same Room. The Carfax Gallery In Buiy-Street Is Showing Some Drawings By The Very Modern German Artist L. Von Hofman, And Some Interesting Bronzes By Mr. Charles Ricketts. Everything Here Looks As If It Has Strayed Out Of A Room At The International. Mr. Ricketts Has So Marked And So Comprehensive A Talent That One Is A Little Impatient With Him For Not Achieving A Masterpiece.

Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1925-Oct-09,"London, England","Art Exhibitions. Tri-National Paintg And Sculpture. 0 England, France, And America. In Pursuance Of One Of Its Objects, To Promote International Good Feeling, The Tri-National Art Exhibition At The Chenil Galleries, Initiated By Mrs. F. H. Harriman, Of New York, Does Not So Much Afford Opportunity For Broad Comparisons Between The Nations Concerned As Bring Selections Of The Contemporary Art Of England, France, And America Together In Friendly Association. .Selections Advisedly, Because, To Judge From The Native Works, It Cannot Pretend To Be Fully Representative. There Are, For Instance, New English Exhibitors, But The Special Flavour Of The New English Art Club Would Be Hard To Find. No Doubt This Is As It Should Be, For Anything Like Sectarianism Was To Be Avoided But If The French And American Selections Have Been Made On The Same Principle This Must Be Looked Upon As An Occasionfor Sampling Rather Than Estimating The Contemporary Art Of Those Countries. Perhaps Mr. Roger Frys Happy Phrase, Something Like A Cross-Section Of The Whole Pictorial Or Sculptural Art Of Each Country, Allowing Full Value To Something Like, Is A Fair Description, And It May Be Agreed That The Exhibition Is Lively And Stimulating Throughout. If There Is A General Conclusion To Be Drawn It Is That Contemporary Artistic Effort, With Its National Flavours, Is Much Less Theoretical Than Appeared To Be The Case About 15 Years Ago. The Designers Have Staked Out Their Claims, And Now They Are Cultivating Them, Witlh, If Anything, An Over-Consciousness Of The Nature Of The Soil. Paint, Formerly Neglected, Is Now Very Much In Evidence. Partry For This Reason, The Definitely Old-Fashioned Things In The Exhibition Are The Jig-Saw Exercises Like Le Ueridon. By Picasso. They Have Something Of The Sentimental Appeal Of Old Numbers Of The Illustrate7I London News. For Once In A Way Sculpture Has Received Proper Attention And A Suitable Place For Its Display. In This Company One, Mr. Frank Dobson, Makes A Very Powerful Impression As A Sculptor Who Really Can Keep Some Relation Between His Forms And Their Filling. Most Of Our Young Men Who Try To Simplify, And To Insist On Planes, Decline Into The Effect Of The Newly Peeled Potato. Mr. Dobson May Not Have The Technical Mastery Displayed In Mr. Jacob Epsteins Head Of Fedora Rozelli, But He Promises To Have A Larger Grasp Of Composing In Sculptural Forms. His Cambria Is Probably The Most Dignified Monument Madle In This Country Since The Beginning Of The Century. The American Exhibits Are Graceful Torso Of Seated Woman, By The Late Mr. Paul Wayland Bartlett, And Victory, By Miss Janet Scudder, Being Typical Examples But, Except For The Animals By Mr. Herbert Heseltine, They Run To Line Rather Than Mass In Their Effect. Maillol Is Represented By A Torso Which Shows Wlhat A, So To Speak, Academic Subject May Becoma In The Hands Of A Real Sculptor There Are Some Charming Animals By Jeanne Poupelet And Three Very Interesting Exercises In Abstraction, Determined By The Materials Employed, By Brancusi. Sorcerer Is Really A Fulfilment In Sculpture Of The Natural Tendency Of A Branching Tree The Fish Is A Highly Polished Oval Of Brass And Torso Is An Ovoid Of Marble. Judged By Their Titles These Works May Not Be Intelligible, But They Have The Great Merit Of Giving Characteristic Form To Substance. It Cannot Be Said That The American Paintings Speak With A Very Certain Voice, And Perhaps The Most National Are The Elegant Figure Compositions, Such As The Galaxy, By Mr. Arthur B. Davies. Girl In Ihinese Costume, By Mir. William Glackens, Obviously Derives From Renoir, And Femnme Avec La Lime, By Paul Burlin, From Derain. Angelina Asleep, By Mr. Maurice Sterne, And Still Life, By Mr. Charles Sheeler, Are Other American Pictures Which Whet The Appetite For More. Of The French Pictures The Most Emphatic Is The Big Nude By Derain, A Splendidly Plastic Study Of Body And Limbs Declining Into Prettiness In The Head. This Work, With Its Discrepancy, Might Well Be Commended To The Hon. John Collier As An Instance Of What Happens When An Artist Allows His Formal Conception To Be Disturbed By The Attractions Of The Model. There Is A Mixture Of Two Kinds Of Beauty. Taking Into Account The Special Object Of This Exhibition, We May Be Content To Bless Its Friendliness And To Name A Few Works By English Artists Which Gave Particular Pleasure In A Round Of The Galleries Sucil As Tthe Slum Park, By Mr. W. P. Roberts Route Nationale, No. I, By Mr. Roger Fry Young London, By Mr. A. R. Thomson The Ardent Shore, By Mr. Nwalter Bayes Lilac, By Mr. F. J. Porter And Figures, By Mr. Dtucan Grant. Some Still Life Paintings By M1R. Augustus John Are A Special Feature. Air. E. Barnard Lintott. At The Same Galleries There Is An Exhibition Of 49 Landscapes In Water-Colour By Mr. E. Barnard Lintott. They Cover A Wide Range Of Country And Effect, And Are Uniformly Good In Feeling And Style, Reaching Their Best When The Conditions Put A Premium Upon Slightness And Directness-As In Rottingdean, The Path To The Old 31Ill, Cagnes, The Red Roof. Cagnes, And Knocke, Belgium. When It Is A Case Of Composing In Masses, Mr. Lintott Is Not So Successful, Though His Desires In This Direction Are Quite Easy To Understand. What He Seems To Need Is A Bolder Grasp Of The Larger Forms-Such As Mountains. The Mayor Gallery. If Only For His Courageous Belief In His Own Generation, Mr. P. Hoyland Mayor Deserves All Good Wishes In His New, Welllighted Gallery At 37, Sackville-Street, Which He Opens With An Exhibition Of Modern English Art. Almost Everything In It May Be Said To Be At The Apparent Growinig Point Of Contemporary Effort. Apparent Because, For Anything We Know, The Leading Shoot May Take Quite Another Direction, And These Buds May Date A Mnere Decade Or Two. Somebody May Discover That, When You Have Said All That There Is To Be Said About Relations In Form And Colour, The Root Of The Matter In Painting Is Relations In P,Aint. However. Grantinig The Aim Of Creating Relations In Form And Colour Which Shall Parallel The Infinite, Most Of These Works Fulfil It Engagingly, And Some Of Them Include The Substance Of Paint In The Scheme. Mr. Paul Nash, For Instance, Is At An Interesting Turn Beginning To Allow Paint To Play A Part In Determining The Relations He Would Establish. That He Should Be A Little Untidy In The Transition From A More Arbitrary Method Is Natural Enough. He Is In The Position Of A Man Who, Having Laid Down A Line Of Conduct, Suddenly Discovers That He Has A Body- Mr Lewisham, In Fact. Mr. Duncan Grant Has Got Over The Transition, And In Market Day, Form, Colour And Sub- Stance, Or Spirit, Soul And Body, As They Might Be Called, Sing Together. Miss Vanessa Bell, Mr. William Roberts, Mr. F. J. Porter, Miss Winifred Nicholson, And Mr. Elliott Seabrooke All Help In The Entertainment, And A Word Must Be Given To The Reticent Little Carving Of Grief, By Mr. Hilary Stratton. Mr. James Mcbeys Etchings. As An Etcher Mr. James Mcbey May Be Said To Have Romped Into The Favour Of Collectors, And The Present Exhibition Of 68 Proofs By Him, And A Few Water-Colours, At The Galleries Of The Fine Art Society, 148, New Bond-Street, Helps To Explain The Reason Why. He Is, First Of All, Immensely Full Of Spirits, And He Has An Easy Command Of Space, Atmosphere, And Movement. A Static Subject, In Which Solidity Is The Requirement, Betrays His Limitations. Perhaps There Is No Living Etcher Who Corresponds More Exactly To What One Feels To Be The Meaning Of Painter Etcher, But Though It Is Tonal Rather Than Linear Relations Which Excite Him, He Uses Line With Exemplary Purity. A Good Example Is Zaanstreek, In Which, Though The Relation Between The Near Boat And The Distant Mills Is Thc Motive, The Work Is Carried Out In A Simple Hatching Of Upright Lines. But It Is In The. More -Impulsive Subjects, Such As Sanuall At Kampen. Antwerp, With A Boat Turning, And Gale At Port Errol, That Mr. Mcbeys Personal Qualities Are Most Apparent. A Number Of His Palestine Subjects, Done In The War, Are In The Exhibition, Including The Never-To-Be-Forgotten Surrender Of Jerusalem To Two Dispassionate Tommies. Downstairs There Is A Large Collection Of Etchings By Various Artists, Including Rembrandt And Zorn. Most Of The Proofs Are Familiar, But There Is An Undescribed Cameron, A River In Flood, And Note May Be Made Of Head Of A Model, Bv That Accomplished Young Etcher Mr. E. Bouverie Hoyton. Landscapes And Flowers. Being Under The Same Roof, At 22, Old Bondstreet, The Gieves And Arlington Gatlleries May Be Treated As One. At The Former There Are Landscapes In Water-Colours, By Mr. Rupert Butler, Who Presents The Somewhat Unusual Character Of Being A Better Composer Than Executant. His Draving Is Weak And His Values Are Incoherent-See Nos. 14 And 15-But He Has A Good Notion Of Bow To Make A Picture Nnd Sonie Command Of Space As A Subject For Moulding. His Skies, For Example, Though Tending To Be Over-Dramatic, Do Give You Succeysive Depths Of Light, As In On Exmoor Ald On The Wiltshire Avon. On The Whole, However, One Would Be Inclined To Pick Out The Careful Studies Of Wiltshire Cottage And A Sussex Bani As His Best Efforts.

FROM OUR MUSEUMS CORRESPONDENT,Exhibition Of Church Art,The Times,1955-May-03,"London, England","Exhibmion Of Church Art I A Long-Continuling Tradiimon From Our Museums Correspondent Chelmsford, May 2 A Programne Of Events Arranged By The Friends Of Essex Churches Began To-Day In The Chapter House Of Chelmsford Cathedral, When Mr. Basil Spence, The Architect Of The New Coventry Cathedral, Opened An Exhibition Of Essex Church Art, Which Is To Continue Until The Evening Of May 13. In His Opening Speech Mr. Spence Said That In England Tbere Was A Long-Continuing Tradition In Church Arts And Crafts. This Must Be Maintained And Means Found To Keep Thz Craftsmen Employed In It. Art Could Rise To Its Greatest Heights As It Had At Times In The Past When The Church Was Its Patron. The Idea Of A Continuing Tradition Is Reflected In The Exhibition, Which Contairs A Section Of Modern Work. Tne Older Exhibits Are Most Fully Represented, And They Include Objects Of Art Or Craft Belonging To Essex Churches And A Smaller Number Of Works Of Religious Art From Private Collections In The County. Among These Last Is A Beautiful Softly Coloured Chelsea China Group Of 1750, Representing The Dead Christ In The Virgins Arms. A Design Derived From Michael Angelos Statue In St. Peters, Rome. It Has Been Lent By Mr. J. J. Tufnell, And Is The Only Known Coloured Example Of This Chelsea Group. Maplewood Maze-R The Most Numerous Class Of Exhibit Is The Church Plate, The Earliest Piece Being A Mnaplewood Mazer Of About 1480-90, With Silver-Gilt Band And Central Medallion, From Holy Trinity, Colchester. Essex Is Not Rich In Pre-Reformation Silver, Since It Lay Too Close To London To Escape The Attention Of Henry Viiis Commissioners. By Compensation, The County Is Rich In Elizabethan Church Plate, Most Of The Dated Pieces Being Of London Make, Though Some Of The Undated Ones Are Thought Possibly To Have Been Made Near Colchester. Of Mid-Seventeenth-Century Work Especially Attractive And Simply Designed Examples Are The Silver Flagon, Cup, And Paten Of 1634 From Messing And The Silver Cup, Paten, And Alms Dish Of 1641 From Netteswell, Which Are Remarkable As Examples Of Entirely Unornamented Puritan Design. Other Things Shown Are Furniture, Hangings, Vestments, Books, Pictures, And Drawings. Perhaps The Most Important Single Object Is The Great Thirteenth-Century Altar Chest From Newport With Five Oil Paintings, The Central One A Crucifixion, Inside The Lid. These Are Remarkably Early Examples Of Their Kind In England. A Crucifix By Benvenuto Cellini Has Been Lent By Mr. W. A. Foyle. Other Events This Week Are A Lecture By Mr. John Betjeman On Friday At Chelmsford And On Saturday And The Afternoon Of Sunday An Exhibition Of The Courtauld Family Siver, Arranged By Mr. Augustine Courtauld, At Spencers, Great Yeldham, Near Halstead.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS203773091/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=5245b992,,
Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1943-Nov-20,"London, England","Art Exhibitions A Czechs Paintings In Addition To The Picture Exhibitions Noticed In Tlhe Times During The Last Week Or Two, A Number Of Others Are Now Open In London. At The Redfern Gallery, 20, Cork Street, There Arc Paintings By The Czechoslovak Artist, Mr. Geza Szobel, Whose Grim Drawings Of The War Have Already Been Seen. His Work In Oils Is Very Different. He Uses Chiefly Depp, Translucent, Glowing Blues, Greens, And Reds, Merging Often One Into Another, In The Depths Of Which Loom Fantastic, Partly Cubist Shapes. There Is No Question Of Mr. Szobels Ability, And Purely As Shapes Floating In Colour His Pictures Are Attractive To The Eye. What The .Ritic Feels Less Certain About Is The Intellectual Content. In Some Degree The Same Criticism Applies To Mr. David Bonibergs Exhibition, Consisting Largely Of Oil Studies Upon Paper, At The Leger Gallery, 13, Old Bond Street. Mr. Bomberg Calls These Pictures Imaginative Compositions, Though They Seem To Start, More Often Than In Mr. Szobels Case, With Something Actually Seen. Occasionally, As In Fishing Folk, That Something Is Pretty Clearly Defined But More Usually It Has Become Fused Into A Pattern Of Rather Quiet, Agreeable Colour-Browns And Greys And Purplish Redsso That Only A Hint Of It Remains. At Its Most Successful Say, Numbers 18 And 30 This Method Gives An Effect Which Can Perhaps Be Compared To Pot-Pourri To Which Somehow A Rhythm Has Been Given. But Again The Question Is-How Long Will The Mind Remain Satisfied ? French Pictures French Paintings Of The Present Century Are On View At The Lefevre Galleries, 1A, King Street, St. Jamess. They Include An Interesting Bonnard Of A Rainy Night In Paris, With The Lights Shining Through The Windows Into The Dusk, And A Pretty Little Vuillard Of A Woman Seated On A Sofa. Rouault Is Represented By A Good Small Head Of A Psnan, And By A Large Feinme Du Cirque And There Are Examples Of Modigliani, Utrillo, Picasso, And Others. A Word, Too, Must Be Said Of Mr. Thomas Carrws Water-Colours, Which Are On View At The Leicester Galleries, Leicester Square, Concurrently With The Portrait Exhibition Which Has Already Been Noticed. Mr. Carr Seems To Have Qualities Which May Well Make Him Art Extremely Popular Painter, For. He Has The Gift Of Prettiness Without Banality Or Vulgarity. On The Whole The Added Body Of Oil-Paint Suits Him Better Than Water-Colour, But There Are Some Charming Drawings In This Collection. Good Examples Are The Iron Bridge And Edenderry Locb, Which Are Tvpical Of His Pale, Rather Misty, Use Of Colour, And His Broad Grouping Ot Shapes, In This Medium. With Mr. Frank Galsworthys Highly Finished And Elaborate Water-Colours Of Flowers And Of Groups Of Porcelain Figures And Other Ornaments, Now At The Walker Galleries, 118, New Bond Street, The Visitor Moves Into Such A Different World That Scarcely A Point Of Contact Remains. The Flower Paintings Are Sometimes A Trifle Hard, But Mr. Galsworthy Has Considerable Skill Of Hand And Has Clearly Laboured Long Over These Pictures. Certainly Such A Thing As The Pedlar Doll And Friends, With -A Water-Colour Tecognizably By William Payne Hanging On The Wall Behind A Table Covered Wvjth Various Ornaments And Knick-Knacks, Is Sorething Of A Tour-De-Force.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS134823284/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=a9505b28,,
Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1934-Mar-01,"London, England","Art Exhibitions Mr. R. 0. Dunlop Nvorking Chiefly-If Not Exclusivelywith The Palette Knife, Mr R. 0. Dunlop, Whose Recent Paintings Are Now On View At The Redfern Gallery, 27, Old Bond Street, Is Distinguished By Two Things In Particular The Soundness Of His Colourmostly In The Range Of Earth Pigments -And The Close Relation In His Work Between Form And Expression. His Pictures Give The Impression, No Doubt Erroneous, Of Having Been Designed In The Course Of Execution. The Danger That Lurks In This Close Relationship, With Its Reliance On The Expressive Capacitv Of Pigment, Might Be Compared To That Of An Emotional Speaker Who Trusts To The Tones Of Hisvoice Rather Than To The Arrangement Of His Words. Mr. Dunlops Paintings, Particularly His Figure Compositions, Are A Little Deficient On The Architectural Side. It Is True That The Architectural Aspect Of Painting Can Easily Be Ridden To Death As A Hobby, But It Is A Good Thing To Keep At The Back Of The Mind, And Mr. Dunlops Work Will Gain In Power With More Rigorous Mental Planning, Which Need Not Be At The Cost Of Direct Expression. Almost As A Consequence Of His Methiod, Except In The Case Of The Half-Length Of A Young Girl, In An Appropriate Scheme Of Green And Subdued Gold, Preference In This Exhibition Nearly Always Goes To The Landscapes To Such Pictures As Notre Dame, Paris, Street, St. Troper, Provenpal Farm, The Harbour, St. Troper, And Mistral Over St. Troper. It Is Not That Landscape Really Needs Less Construction Than The Figure, But That Construction In It Is-Owing To The Atmospheric Conditionsmore Dependent Upon The Right Placing Of Colour Values And Less Upon The Mental Grasp Of The Forms And In The Placing Of Colour Values Mr. Dunlop Is Seldom At Fault. Titles Do Nor Count For Very Much, But It Might Be Said That The Picture Called Contemplation, With Ail Its Merits, Thirows Light On Mr. Dunlops Present Weakness. It Is Too Much A Study Of Contemplation And Not Enough A Study Of A Young Woman Resting Her Arm On A Chair. But -With These Reservations About His Treatment Of The Figure, In The Landscapes Named And In Flowerpiece, Mr. Dunlop Is A Very Satisfying Artist. Mr. Reginald Hallward Among The Works By Mr. Reginald Hallward At The Arlington Gallery, 22, Old Bond Street, There Are A Good Many Designs For Stained Glass, And He Has Given A Personal Turn To That Medium, But To Speak Of Him As A Decorative Designer Would Be To Ignore Both The Poetical Sentiment And The Technical Virtuosity Which Distinguish His Paintings. He Is An Other-World Artist, Starting, No Doubt, From Some Actual Plan, But Relating It To A Consistent Landscape Of His Own Imagination. It Is A Landscape Of Rocky Terraces And Very Tall Trees, With An Atmosphere In Which Anything Might Happen. Mr. Hallward Is An Artist To Be Pored Over Rather Than To Be Taken In At A Glance, And This Must Limit The Circle Of His Appreciators At The Present Day. Miss Ruth Doggett In Her Exhibition Of Landscapes, With The Title August In England, At The Fine Art Societys Galleries, 148, New Bond Street, Miss Ruth Doggett Has Achieved An Admirable And Intelligent Balance Between Pure Impressionism, Which Follows All The Vagaries Of The Light And The Landscape, And A Method Of Sound, At Times Even Systematic, Construction. It Is A Difficult Balance, And It Is Hardly To Be Wondered At If In A Few Pictures Her Colour Suffers In The Process And In A Few Others Her Method Of Simplification Is Rather Harsh. But For The Most Part She Is Remarkably Successful She Knows When To Stop And Certainly Does Not Risk Spoiling Her Pictures For The Sake Of Any Subtlety Beyond Her Powers, But She Manages Her Talents Competently, Economically, And With Assurance.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS202320481/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=dbf17f63,,

Andre Dunoyer De Segonzac Will Be Opened To-Morrow At The Independent Gallery, 7A, Grafton-Street, W. Some Of This Artists Work Has Been Seen Here Before, But This Is, We Believe, The First One-Man Show That He Has Had In London. The Obvious Thing About His Landscapes Is A Massive And Noble Simplicity. Fields, Roads, Hills, And Trees Stand Together In A Grand And Plain Design. It Is Not At Once That One Sees How This Dignified Simplicity Of Mass And Contour Is Very Delicately Adjusted By Transitions From Plane To Plane. His More Complex Designs, Such As Nos. 4 And 7, Do Not Express Themselves So Beautifully As Simpler Things Like Nos. 1, 3, And 5 And It Is In Looking At The More Complex Paintings That One Understands Best M.

Each Has Points That Makc It Preferable To The Other And The Difference Rouses A Desire To See The Studies For The Superb Painting No. 16, Les Deux Ormes. The Fine Austerity Of The Paintings Is Matched By The Dignity And Direct Force Of The Drawings.

The Private View On Saturday Was Crowded And We All Know How Difficult It Is To Maintain The Purity Of Ones Principles In The Face Of Popular Favour. In Point Of Fact There Is In Tho Present Exhibition At The Dudley Gallery A Good Deal Less Eccentricity Thala Of Old, And Much Less Preference Of Ugliness For The Sake Of Ngliness Nay,Eight Or Ten Of The Chief Pictures Might Find Their Place In An Ordinary Exhibition And Not Be Thought Impossibly Advanced. From Any Point Of View Several Of The Pictures And Nearly All The Drawings Are Very Good And Interesting, Though The Club Has Not On This Occasion Shown The Work Of Some Of Its Best Men-Yir. C. W. Furse, For Instanceflnd Though It Appears To Have Lost Mr. Sargent. Perhaps The Exhibitors Who Make The Strongest Impression Are Mir. C. H. Shannon, Mr. Hel-Ry Tonks, Mr. Freed Brown, Mr. Bertram Priestman, And Minr. W. Y. Macgregor, All Of -Whom Have Been Pretty Constant Exhibitors Here, But Who Have This Year Taken A Stride Forwavrd. Mr. Macgregors Largelandscape, The Quarry 98, Is The Sort Of Work That Appeals To Artists Rather Than To The Ordinary Eye But Those Who Can Take Pleasure In A Low-T6Ned Picture, And Who Are Not Repelled By The Rough-Ness Affected By This Whole School, Wiil Find Much To Admire In This Dignified Composition, Recalling, As It Does, Much Of The Wvork Of Professor Legros. Mr. Tonks Is Varied Alike In Subject Aucd In Method. We Are Not Sure Whether Tho Best Of All His Works Is Not Tho Delicate Draving Called The Barn 17, A Perfect Example Of Its Kind But His Most Ambitious Effort Is The Painting Called The Shadow Of The Cliff 106. This Charming Picture Of An English Watering Place Is At Once Gay And Harmonious In Colour, But It Is Nou Easy To See How One Is To Focus The Picture. Naturally One Dwells On The Figures In The Foreground, But These Are Relativelv Blurred Whereas The Houses On The Cliff-Top Are Clear And Distinct, As Though The Spectator Were Meant To Fix His Eye Upon Them And To Make Everything Else Secondary. Such An Inversion Of The Common Theory Of A Picture, Is, Even In These Days Of Experiments, A Little Surprising. Mslr. F. Brown, Professor At The Slade School, Is Among The Most Sincere Of The Eng,Lish Art,Ists V.Ho Incline To Impressionism If He Seeks After Broad Effects By Seemingly Simple Means It Is Not Because He Is Not The Master Of An Extremely Delicate Brush. Ris Striking Little Picture, A Coming Storm 75-Which We Believe Is A View Of Knaresborough-Is Really A Ve.-Y Fine Thig, And When Time Has Softened Its Slight Harshnesses Might Fairly Take Its Place By The Side Of A Landscape By Millet. Mir. Bertramu Priest,Man Has Stuldied Constable To Some Purpose In His Picture Of An Autumn Cloud 80 But, Like So Many Artists Who Paint For Exhibition, He Tends To Exaggerate. There Is An Excellent Aud Very Careful Woodland Landscape Called Through The Trees, By Mfr. Francis Bate 56 But Mir. Charles Conder, From Whom Much Has Been Expected, Is A Littre Disappointing In His Landscape In Alsace 53, While Mr. Buxton Kinight And Mr. Mark Fisher Have Not Seat Their Strongest Work. On The Other Hand, The Souvenir Of Vandyck 48, By Mtr. C. H. Shannon-The Interesting Draughtsman And Lithographer Who Has Already Made His Mark In Those Departments,And Appears Tq Be Capable Of Making It As A Painter-Is A Charming Study In Cool Tones Which Will Be Found By Many People The Most Attractive Picture In The Exhibition. We May I Add That Many Other Artists Whose Work One Is, Accustomed To See In This Room Are Characteristically Represented-Mr. H. B. Brabazon, For Example, Mr. Wilson Steer, Mr. Sickert, Mir. Arthur Tomson, And Fr. S. P. Mallet. There Are Many Smaller Exhibitions For Which The Briefest Possible Word Of Notice Must Suffice. At The Goupil Gallery The Managers Have Fallen Back Upon Jozef Israels, Who Is, Of Course, Always Well Worth Seeing, But Whese Work Is Probably Better Known In London Than That Of Any Other Living Painter, Certainly Any Foreign Painter.

Finn Shows Some Seventy Pictures And Drawings Of The Kentish Coast, Of Wales, Of Holland All Conscientous And Full Of Observation, And I Some Of Them Interesting Records Of Momentary Sfects Of Light. Mtiss Sosavvallis Shows A Few Unpretending But Attractive Drawfings Of Italy At Mr. Dunthornes Gallery In Vtigo-Street. Lastly, At The Dutch Gallery In Brook-Street, Is A Rather More Ambitious Exhibition-Some Fifty Works By Mxr. William Estall, An English Painter Who -Eems To See Nature With The Eyes Of The Modern Dutchmen Who Follow Israels And Mauve. There Is No Question About His Ability Or About The Charm Of His Work When He Is At His Best. As In The Beautiful Drawing Called Dawn-Yorkshire Moors 17 But The Whole Impression Made By This Collection Is An Impression Of Sunless Melancholy. Mr. Estall Does Justice Neither To His Own Talent Nor To The Beauty Of England.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS167960944/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=d0eda609,,

It Is Not A New Form Of Breakdance Busking, But Serious Performance Art The Triptych Nan. Always Referred To Rather Pretentiously In The Third Person Singular, The Triptych Man Turns Out To Be A Suitable Symbol For The Show. Organized By The Arts Council, Its Aim - To Assess The Achievement, Of British Artists Over The Last Five Years - Is Ambitious. Its Methods - Tihree Selectors Sitting In Judgment Like A Three-Headed Deity Rewvarding Thc Good, Casting Out The Bad - Are Distinctly Questionable. T He Triptych Man And Triptych Judge Have Stuck All Six Of Their Necks Well And Truly Out. Jon Thompson, A Lecturer At Loldsmiths College, And One Of The Selectors, Sees His Function Ais Being To Spark Off Public Debate I Expect A Lot Of Flack, He Says. Unfortunately, He, Marjorie Alithorpe Guyton An Art Historian And Sandy Nioffat Painter And Art Tutor At The Glasgow School Of Art Seem To Haie Been Overwhelmed By The 1.000 V Isits To Artists Studios And The 18 Months Of Deliberation. For All The Editing Efforts Of Nicola Bennett, The Exhibition Organizer, A Read Through Their Catalogue Is As Illunuinating As A Trudge Through Treacle. In Conversation, Thompson Is More Succinct. The Whole Mniimalist Ethic Is Under Challenge. He Says, And Adds That The Arrival Of Abstract Work In This Country Was The Result Of An American Brain-Washing Programme After The Var More A Usurpation Titan A Fertilization.

Null,Art Exhibition,The Times,1930-Dec-05,"London, England","Art Exhibition Wood Engravings In Woodcuts And Some Words Lmr. Gordon Craig Gives The Right Reason At The Present Day For Cutting By Hand Designs That Mnight Be Drawn With The Pen. For The Explicit Reason That Wood Engraving, Being A Difficult Task, Lends The Hand Precision, Perhaps Some Style, Is A Tough Craft., And One To Grow Fond Of. . . . There Is Good Reason For An Imaginative Fellow Lhaving Some Tough Craft It Cools- His Ardour. It Is Very Unlikely That Any Of The Innumerable Contemporary Artists Who Are Wood Engraving Are Guided By This Reason, But That Does Not Matter They Have To Go Through With It. At A Time When The Tendency Is More And More To Shirk The Executive Side Of Things In Art Any Wood Engraving Is Better Than None. So Imany Contemporary English Artists Are Submitting Themselves To The Discipline Of Wood Engraving That They Have To Divide Themselves Into Two Societies-Tlie Society Of Wiood Engravers, Exhibiting At The Rediern Gallery, 27, Old Bond-Street And The English Wood Engraving Society, Exhibiting At The St. Georges Gallery, 32A, George-Street, Hanover-Square. Between The Two Societies There Does Not Appear To Be Any Distinction Of Aim Or Policy-Several Artists Belong To Bothbut It Does Happen That The Redfern Gallery Exhibition Runs More To The Illustrative And The St. Georges Gallery Exhibition More To The Constructive Kind Of Wood Engraving. There Is A Great Deal To Be Said For The Illustrative Kind Being Printed From A Design In Relief And With The Same Kind Of Ink The Wood Engraving Is Second Cousin To Typography, And Gains In Formal Respects From The Relationship, And Illustration Compels The Artist To Think About Sometlhing Wlhich Is Not Purely Artistic-Always An Advantage To His Purely Artistic Capacities But Since Constructors Are More Apt Than Illustrators To Shirk Manual Discipline, The Constructive Wood Engraving Is Perhaps The One To Be Most Encouraged At The Present Day On Grounds Of Artistic Hygiene. Both Kinds Of Wood Engraving, However, Must Be Judged By The Quality Of The Designs Produced In Them, And Here The Two Exhibitions Are Fairly Equal-With The Balance Slightly In Favour Of The One At The St. Georges Gallery. But There Are Some Very Good Things At The Redfern. Of All Contemporary Wood Engravers Mrs. Gwendolen Raverat Is Perhaps The One Who Owes Least To Fads And Fashions, And Her Set Of The Seasons Are A Delight. For Sheer Beauty Of Craftsmanship There Is Nobody To Equal Mir. Eric Gill. His Designs Here, Transiliens Colles, For A Good One, Are Not Ostensibly Illustrations, But The Discipline And Example Of Typography Are Always Implied In His Work. In The Matter Of Suggested Colour In Black And White The Finest Thing In The Exhibition Is The First Of The Decorations For Celeste No. 56, A Study Of Two Roses, By Ir. John Nash, Who Also Manages Better Than Most To Combine Construction With A Fairly Close Reference To Nature. As To The Proportion Of Black And White In A Wood Engraving Tastes Differ In His Book Mr. Gordon Craig Prints Two Amusingly Contradictory Notes On The Subject By John Ruskin And Odilon Redon But One Cannot Help Feeling That A Good Mnany Contemporary Artists Would Do Well To Cut More Wood Away. Miss Clare Leightons Forcible Designs For Wuthering Heights, For Instance, Are. Blacker Than The Emotions Of Even That Work Require. In Kensington Gardens, Figures Reclining On The Grass, By Mliss Althea Willoughby, Is An Excellent Design In A Rather Sophisticated Manner The Very Title Of Song Against Speed, By Miss Nora S. Unwin, Is Attractive And The Illustrations To The Scventh Man, By -Mr. Robert Gibbings, Coronilla, By Mr. Paul Nash, Elm Angel, By Mr. Eric Ravilious, Yellow Iris, By Mr. Eric Daglish, Uinicorn, By Mr. David Jones, A Corner Of The Forest, By Mr. Ethelbert White, Morning With Swiss Family Robinson, By Miss Pamela D. Nathan, And Holiday, By Air. E. Nicholson, Are All Prints Worth Looking Out. At The St. Georges Gallery, Where The Average Size Of Prints Is Larger And The Decorative Effect On The Wall More Pronounced, The Centre Of Interest Is In The Illustrations By Mr. Blair Hughes-Stgnton For Birds, Beasts, And Flowers, By The Late D. H. Lawrence. As Might Be Expected, Without The Text Their Illustrative-Or Symbolical-Meaning Is Not Very Clear, But They Are Extraordinarily Moving As Designs. Nobody Can Use The Direct Emotional Attack Of Black And White Better Than Imr. Blair Hughes-Stanton. Miss Gertrude Hermes Excels Him In The Handling Of Intermediate Tones, And Her Willows And Water-Lilies Is Possibly The Best Print In The Exhibition From A Technical Point Of View. For Some Reason, Perhaps Because The Medium Implies Occupation For The Hand, Abstract Designs Do Not Come Off Very Well In Wood Engraving, And The Examples By Mr. John Tandy-Though They Are Goodish Designs In Themselves-Are Among The Few Things In The Exhibition That Look As If They Had Been Better Produced By Some Other Means. Prints Of Special Interest, For One Reason Or Another, Are Landscape, By Ir. Claughton Pellew, Silent Noon, By Mr. John F. Greenwood, Riding On Dartmoor, By Mliss Mary E. Groom, Denizens Of Tbe Deep, By Miss Dorothy Hirst., Burnham Beeches, By Miss Marjory Firth, And The Hayrick, Autumn, By Mr. Sidney Rodgers.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS202449797/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=b6166e36,,
FROM OUR ART CRITIC,French Art,The Times,1932-Jan-14,"London, England","Entertainments French Art British Amuseum Exhibitions Fronm Our Art Crrric To Suggest The Relationship Between The Present Exhibitions Of Frenclh Art At The British Mluseum And The One At The Royal Acadeniy, The Museum Exhibitions Are Conicerned Exclusively With Frenclh Graphic Art, In Its Thuree Forms Of Illumtinated Manuscripts. Drawings, Engravings, While The Academy Exhibition Deals With Tlhe Frenchl Arts Generally. In Inanuscripts And Drawings The Two Institutions To Some Extent Cover The Salie Ground, But-Particularly At Certain Periods-The Representation At The Muscum1 Is Fuller And Inore Systematic, And In The Case Of Drawings It Comes Down To The Present Day. Frenclh Engravings Are To Be Seen Only At The Mluseumn, And Here, Again, Contemporary Artists Are Included. Apart Firom The Differences Noted, The Conditions At The Museum Are Specially Favourable For Leisurely And Ininterrupted Study. The Scope And Character Of The Exhibition Of Drawings And Engravings In The King Edward Vii. Galleries, And Of Illuminated Manuscripts In The Grenville Library, Were Fully Described In The Times Of January 5. For Present Purposes -After A Comment On The Extraordinary Richness Of The Miuseum Collections, Formed Largely By Private Generosity-It Will Be Enough To Giance At A Few Of The More Interesting Or Important Examples. The Absenee Of Catalogues Will Not Affect The Visitor, All The Works Bein- Labelled With Title Of Work. Namle Of Arti-St. Dates, And Description And T-He Arrangement In Each Section And Class Of Work Is Chronological So That The Exliibitioxis Are Very Easy To Follow But It Naturally Makes Detailed References Difficult, Withoutt The Tttking Of Elaborate Notes-Apt To Be Misleading Vhen Written In Haste. Drawings To Take The Drawings And Engravings First-Onl Tho First Slope Case In Tile King Edwvard Vii. Galleries There Are A Few Primitives, Anonymous, And Showing Thle Italian And Flemish Entanglements Of The Period, A Marriage Of The Virgin, Early Fifteenth Century, And A Visitation, Of About 1500, Being Particularly Beautiful, Wvitli A Distinctly French Flavour In Tlle Facial Types. A Drawing Of A Man In The Style Of Fran,Ois Clouet Has The Interest Of A Somewlhat Tentative Line, As If The Decided Character Familiar In Drawings Of The Class Caime After Prelininary Searc Hing. Thouglh The Slope Cases Contain Several Other Interesting Works-Such As A Very Fine Landscape, View Of Park And Fountain, By Nicolas Poussin, An Alleged Self-Portrait Of Poussin, Made, According To An Italian Inscription, At Rome In 1630, During Convalescence After A Severe Illness, A Sensitive Drawing Of The Nude, By Francois Lemnoine, 1688-1737, Formerly Attributed To Watteau, A Mnsterly Study Of A Child, By Philippe De Clampaigne, And An Architectural Design Bv Thotmas De Thomnion 1756-1814-It Will Be Convenient Here To Turn At Once To The Splendid Group Of Portrait Drawings By The Clouets And Their School, On The First Screen. These Inake It Clear Why The Clouets Are Often Spoken Of As French Holbeins, Though The Desciiption Ought To Be Reversed, Since It Is Likely That Holbein Was Influenced By Jean Clouet. It Will Be Observed That The Clouet Heads Are Inore Elaborately Modelled, And Rely Less Upon Inflection Of Line Than The Typical Holbein Portrait Drawing.-- It Is In Looking At The Cloucts, The Claudes, And The Watteaus That We Realize Time Wealth Of The Museum Collections, In The Case Of Watteau The Richest And Most Representative Public Collection In The World. To Discuss The Claude And Watteau Drawings Wvould Be Idle They Are To Be Enjoyed-Though Claudes Music Of Space Mimay Be Noted, -And Also Watteaus Preference For The Draped Over The Nude Figure. A Head Of A Child, By Greuze, Suggests That He Weas A More Virile Artist Than His Clharaqteristic Paintings Allowed Him To Appear, And There Is A Remarkably Fine Head Of A Man In A Hat, Attributed To David. Ingres Follows With A Group Of Drawings, Anid Then Gericaults Visit To England, Recalled By Recent Coirespondence In Ile Times, Is Documented In A Sheet Of Studies Of The Family Of The Bootmaker Witlh Wlhom He Lodged In London. Another London Record Is Construetion Of The Thames Eembankment, Showving Waterloo Bridge And The Shot Tower, Dated July, 1866, By Daubigny.. Thale Are Two Very Fine Drawings By Decamnp,S, Eastern Mlother And Child, And Soutliern-Landseape, And Then, Tluough Jongkind, The Gallicized Dutcllmani, We Pass To The Impressionists, Followed By -Rodin, Odillon Redon, Toulouse Lautrec-His Studies Of Liorses Ale Unexpected-Steinlen, Witlh His Cats, And So To The Present-Day As Represented By. Maillol, Signac, Segonzac, Vliaminck, Mkatissc, And Others. Engra?Viintgs The Engravings Mire Grouped According Tol Iedituma-Wood Engravinas, Line Engravings, And Etchings-Chronologically In Each Group. To The Wood Erlgraving Section-As Also To That Of-Cdntemaporary Illustration-Tle Department . Of- Printed Books Has Contributed. A Great Prize Is The Very Large Wood Engraving, Coloured By Hand, Of Christ On The Cross, Dating From About 1510, By A Toulouse Artist. This Was Found Folded Up Inside A Uorse -The Small Satchel Used At Alass. Only One Other Impression Is Known, End Tllat Is Uncoloured. Comparing This And The Other Early French Wood Engravings In Memory Witlh German Examples, One Fancies A Greater Ease Of Composition. Amilong The Books Is Lhistoire Du Chevalier Olsen, Of About 1480, One Of The Earliest Examples Of French Book Illustration, And There Are Several Books Of Hours And Dances Of Death Witl Wood Engravings. Duvet, 1495-1561, Known As Tie Master Of The Unicorn, And Jean De Gourimont I., 1506-1555, Are Well Represented, And Then Wve Pass To The Group Of Line Engraved Portraits, Including A Charlining One, In Open Line, By Chaules Mellan, 1598-1668, Of Louis Xiv. As A Boy. Mezzotinit In Black And White Does Not Seeim To Have Been Popular In France, Thlougli A Few Examples Are Shiown, But There Is A Fine Group Of Imezzotints Printed In Colour, By Caiitier Dagoty, 1716-1781, Including Twvo Beautiful Still Life Subjects, Together Witlh Aquatints In Colour By Janinet And Debucourt. Included Among Thle Etchings There Is The Only Known Etclhing By Ingres, A Portrait Of The Archbishop Of Besancon Andl There Are Fine Groups Of Lithographs By Daunnier And Etclings By Meryon. A Drypoint By Paul Helleu Of A Lady Looking At Wntteanu Drawvings In The Louv2E2 Shows The Saine Frames As Those Surroundin. The Watteau Drawings Lent By The Louvre To The Burlington House Exhibi Tion. The Contemporary Books Have Illulstrations By Lucien Pissarro, Herrnine David, Marie Laurenciti And Labrari?Eu1. Probably The Illumiinated. Manuscripts. In The Greniville Library, Do Not Excel Tho Finest At Burlington House-Certainly Not Whlell It Collies To Jeanl Fouquet-But Theil Niass Arrangemiienit In Chronological Order Continued At Foot Of Next Column Gives A More Consistent Impression Of This Torm Of French Art. The Earliest, Such As The Bible In Latin, Of The Niddle Of The Ninth Century, Aue Definitely Byzantine In Style, And Then There Is A Gradual Transition To Gothic, At Its Best As Regards Harmony Of The Page, One Would Say, In Tho Late Tlhirteentlh And Early Fourteenth Centuries. Examples Of Special Beauty In The Miniatures Are La Sainte Abbay 21 And The Breviary 37-Eatly Fifteenth Century-With An Exquisite Little Picture Of St. George And The Dragon. Breviary 26 Has Marginal Deeorations Of The Games Of Quintain And Hoodman Blind. Gradually The Style Of Tlhe Minintures Becomes Mlore Fully Pictorial-There Is One Leaf From The Etienne Chevalier 3Book Of Hours, Bv Jean I,Ouquetand Witli The Sixteentlh Cenftury The Artist Begins -To Feel The Pagta As A Hindrance Rather Than A Help To Lus Activities.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS168240686/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=9257c9e9,,

Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1924-Mar-31,"London, England","Art Exhibitions. Imipressions Of India. I No Slight Is Intended To The Impressions I Of India And Kashmir By Miss Nora Wright, At The Brook-Street Galleries, In Desciibing Them As Jig-Saw Patterns. Miss Wright Has The Pattern-Making Instinct Highly Developed, And She Had The Judgment To Record Her Pleased And Amused Impressions Of The Country By The Artistic Method Already At Her Command. In India-My Impressions, She Has Given Us Something Like A Childs Happy Memories Of The Pantomime Just Before Falling To Sleep Mountains, Water-Carriers, Cows, I Horses, And Elephants All Superimposed, With No Regard For Relative Size, But Care For A Decorative Composition. The Whole Is Dominated By The Shadowy Figures Of Polo-Players In Silhouette, Which May Or May Not Have A Symbolical Meaning. The Flowers Of Kashmir Shows That Miss Wrights Pattern-Making Is Something More Thlan Patchw,Ork In Colour, The Informal Arabesque Of Blooms Which Makes The Surface Of The Design Being Held Together By A Banded Arrangement Underneath. Here And There, In The Excellent Drawing Of White Bulls, For Example, There Are Hints That Miss Wright Has Been Influenced Unconsciously By The Native Traditional Style And Many Of Her Pictures Are Touched With Freakish Humour. Thus, In Unsettled, It Is The I Rabble Of Mountains Which Seems To ! Move, To The Discomfiture Of Cattle In The Foreground. For Harmony Of Colour Counting The Herds Is, Perhaps, The ! Choicest Of The Pictures. Five Artists. Of The Five Young Artists, All More Or Less Modern In Their Aims. Who Fill The Alpine Club Gallery. Mill-Street,! Conduit-Street, Wvith Paintings, Watercolours, And Drawings, Mr. Frank Potter Would Seem To Be The Least Dependent On Aims And The Most On Craftsmanship. His The Allotment, Woodland Scene, No. 2. And Surrey Landscape Are-L Really Excellent Works Nicely Simplified As To The Facts, Well Organized As Com- Positions, And Remarkably True In Atmo-I Spheric Quality. Next To Him One Would Place Mr. Jan Juta, Whose Intelligent Practice Of His Art Is Well Seen By Com- I Paring His Paintings From Life And Nature,! His Designs For Book Illustration, And His J Drawings. In Each Case There Is That Evidence Of Application To Purpose Which Is One Of The Most Encouraging Signs In The Young Artist. The Illustrations-To Cannes And The Hills, By Miss R,6N6! Juta, And Sea And Sardinia, By Mr. D. Hi. Lawrence-Are Extremely Good. The Subjects Are Reduced To The Simplest Terms, And Then Stated In Bold Colourpatterns With A Very Discriminating Use Of Black. Mr. Horace Brodzky Brings An Exotic Flavour Into The Exhibition. People And Buildings In New York Are The Subjects Of His Pictures, And In Them He Shows, A Power Of Massive Arrangement Andwhat May Be Called A Full Taste In Colour. Mr. Hyam Myer Leans Too Much To What Used To Be Called The Gorblimy Type Of Humanity, And He Should Paint Better When He Is Less The Devil Of A Fellow, But His Drawings Are Good, And - So Are Mir. Adrian Daintreys. Trish Scenery. At The Rooms Of The Irish Literary Society. Windsor House, Victoria-Street, There Are Sketches In Oils Of Irish Scenery And Other Subjects By Professor Peter J. Keelan And Mrs. Eve Keelan. What They Lack In Force They Make Up For In Sensibility, Being Fresh And Direct Impressions Of Changing Moods In The Wicklow Mountains And Elsewhere. In Addition To Their Sympathy With The Subjects Represented, Both Artists Have Sympatlhy With Their Medium, So That Their Intentions Come Through With A Persuasiveness Which Is Often Absent From Work Of More Obvious Accomplishment-With A Touch Of The Blarney, In Fact. On The Hill Of Howth. And Rushing Waters. Co. Galway, By Professor Keelan, And The Waterfall, Wicklow Mountains, By Mrs. Keelan, Are Good Examples. John Drawings. At The Beaux Arts Gallery, 1, Brutonplace, There Is Now To Be Seen A.Collection Of Early Drawings By Mr. Augustus John, A.R.A., Belonging To The Period Of His Transition From The Slade Student To The Professional Artist. Apart From Their Individual Merits They Show Clearly The Careful Study Of Human Form And Feature Which Preceded The Freedom Of His Later Manner, Before Accuracy Broadened Into Generalized Truth And They Might Well Appeal Strongly To People Who Are A Little Disturbed At The Departures From Strict Proportion Which Proceed Naturally From Drawing Which Aims At Expression Rather Than Representation. At The Same Time These Drawings Are Anything But Literal In The Imitative Sense Of The Word, Because Everything In Them Is Duly Translated Into Terms Of The Chalk Or Pencil. They Have, Moreover, Great Variety In Subject And Treatment, Ranging From Portraits To Studies Of The Figure In 18Th-Century Costume. From The Earliest Of The Series, The Bird In The Hat, A Half-Length Of A Girl In Pen-Cil Line, The Increasing Mastery Of The Draughtsman Can Be Studied In The Most Interesting Mainer. Nude Girl In Crouching Attitude 10, Mrs. John 13, And Study Of Mr. Ambrose Mcevoy Are Especially Beautiful.

Mr. A. S. Hartrick And Bfr. Sydney W. Carline At The Goupil Gallery, Becalise They Both Have That Setisibility To -Iature Whieh Is One Of The Charms Of English Art. It Is Extremely Imteresting To See This Charicteristio Quality Persistmg In Work Which Reflects The Artistic Ideals Of Two Generations Mr. Hartrick, Who Is Primarily A Draughtsman, Show,S Watercolours And Drawings With A Reed Pen And Rolour, Made. For The Most Part In The Neighbourhood Of Clevedon, Somerset. It Is A Part Of The Country Which Has Little To Offer To The Large-Scale Landscape Designer, But Yields A Good Deal Tosympathetic Pottering At Close Quarters. Not That Mr. Aartrick Is Pottering In Style He Appreciates Character, But He Is Economical In Statement, And He Is Remarkably Successful Im Keeping The Paper Filled With Light Even When He Is Working In Line. There Is A Peculiar Effect Of Light Reflected From The Channel In This Neighbourhood Which He Conveys Admirably In The Harbour, Old Clevedon, Where An Inlet Winds Through The Mud Isats Between The Church Of In Memoriam And Woodspring-Or Worspring-Priory. Most Of The Drawings Represent Small Things- On The Beach. Clevedon, The Magpie, The Beach Chairs -But They Are Small Things Recorded With A Selective Vision And A Feeling For Style. Morning On Cleeve Hill, One Of The Finest Views In England, Seen From A Window, With A Girl At Her Toilet, Is As Happy A Picture As One Could Wish Ta See. As Becomes A Younger Man, Mr. Carline, Who Shows Oil Paintings, Watercolours, And Drawings, Is More Guarded In His Response To Nature, And His Pictures Are More Obviously Orgamiized, Btit It Is The Response That Distinguishes Him From The More Cosmopolitan Artists Of His Generation. Delicate Colour In Subtle Relations Is For Him The Great Appeal, And It Is Confessed With Reserved Beauty Of Execution In Such Landseaipes As Capel Curig, Moel-Siabo D, Willow Tree In Frost, And Tree-Trunk. These Are Really His Best Paintings- Willow Tree In Frost Is The Best Of All-But There Are Others With Bolder Compositional Devices.

Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1927-May-26,"London, England","Art Exhibitions. Flower Pictuifes. For Sheer Pleasure There Is Nothing In London Galleries At The Moment To Com Pare With The Exhibition Of Ffower Pictures, 1568 To 1027, At Messrs. Knoedlers, 15, Old Bond-Street. To The Chelsea Flower Show, With Which It Coincides, It Stands In The Relation Of Art To Nature, And Excursions Profitable To The Right Enjoyment Of Both Might Be Made Between The Two. In A Sense Flower-Painting Brings All Artists To A Level-But Only To Show The Differences Between Them. Some Paint Flowers Like Vegetables, Others Like Souls With Some Fortn Is The Principal Concern, With Others Colour--Whether Intrinsic Or As Conditioned By The Play Of Light With Others, Agai, Iragrance-.Or, Rather, That Aura In Form, Colour, Light, And Fragrance Are All Diffused, Which Is Helpfully Suggested By The Word Bouquet. This Gives Us A Lead To The Most Enchanting Pictures In The Present Exhibition. Flowers Lend Themselves More Or Less Well To Every Practice Of Painting, Imitative Or Abstract, Atmosphenc Or Decorative, But They Lend Themselves Best Of All To The Kind Of Ainting In Which Formal And Substantial Qualities Are Pretty Evenly Balanced. The Emphasis May Be A Little One Way Or A Little The Other, But The Artist Who Would Get The Most Out Of Flowers Must Be A Painter, In The Specific Meaning, As Well As A Designer. He Must Have The Capacity, Easier To Recognize Than To Describe, For Translating The Beauty Of One Substance Into The Beauty Of Another. Mere Imitation Of The Substance Of Flowers Will Not Do It, Nor Will The Merely Workmanlike Handling Of Pigment There Must Be A Process For Which Reincarnation, Though Inexact, Seems The Only Word. Consequently It Is Not Surprising To Find That The Most Enchanting Pictures In This Exhibition Correspond To The Phase Of French Impressionism-Using The Term Broadly Enough To Include Manet At One End And Cezanne, Vuillard, And Bonnard At The Other. Impressionism, We Might Almost Say, Was Made For Flower-Painting. This Is Not To Deny The Attractions Of The First Room, Containing Works By Velvet Breughel, Mary Moser, And The Dutchmen -Van Huysum In Particular. These Painters, With Their Massive Compositions, Crafty Colour Arrangements, And Solid Execution, Did Get The Qualities In Flowers Which Can Be Summed Up As Handsome. Ness, But They Missed The Qualities That Are Summed Up As Bouquet. Their Flowers Remain Beautiful Vegetables. Perhaps The Romantic Movement Was Necessary, But -And Not Forgetting The Small Brightness Of The Early Italian Flower-Painters, Charmingly Recalled Here By No. 62, By The Douanier Rousseau-It Really Does Seem As If We Had To Wait Until The Middle Of The 19Th Century For The Full Apprecia. Tion Of Flowers As Flowers In Painting. The Awakening To Light Had, Of Course, A Great Deal To Do With It-The Inclination To Paint The Visible World As A Many-Coloured Envelope In Which Form Is Felt Rather Than Perceived. Even Manet Came Down A Little On The Vegetable Side-Though No. 45, In Which Dull Red And Brown Flowers Are Compared With A Gilt Frame, And The Dark Stand Of The Bowl Strikes A Bass Note, Is A Magnificent Piece Of Decoration-And If We Had To Name The Floweriest Paintings In The Exhibition We Should Point To The Examples By Vuillard, Bonnard, Berthe Morisot, And Renoir And Among The Renoirs We Should Choose, Not The Noble Group Of Mixed Flowers In A Blue Bowl, But The More Diffused Nos. 57 And 60. That Is To Say, From The Point Of View Of Floweriness. But Here Less Than Anywhere Must Narrow Standards Be Adopted, And As Between The Great Rounded Mass Of Flowers Resembling Mallows, With The Light Behind Them, By Monet 48B The Serenely Observed Bouquet De Fleurs In An Even Light, By Camille Pissarro The Fantastic Vase Chinois, By Odilon Redon The Inlaid Pivoines, By Braque And The Ingenious Vase De Fleurs Sur Une Table, By Matisse, It Is Hard Indeed To Say How Flowvers Ought To Be Painted. Among The Englfsh Pictures There Is Nothing To Surpass The Mixed Bunch No. 67 By Bliss Ethel Walker. The Warren Gallery. The New Warren Gallery, At 39A, Maddox-Street, Opens Like A May Morning With Water-Colours By Mr. Paul Nash. We Do Not Remember To Have Received A Happier Impression Of This Admirable Artist. It Might Be Rash To Say That Mr. Nash Paints Better In Water-Colour Than In Oil, But There Can Be No Doubt That The Slighter Medium Is Peculiarly Well Suited To His Intentions As A Designer. He Conceives Of The Space Enclosed By The Frame Of The Picture As A Void In Three Dimensions, And Then Proceeds To Inform It With What Somebody Has Aptly Called Plastic Rhythm By The Deft Placing Of Tones, Sufficiently Representative Of Natural Forms For Intelligibility, Which Establish The Lateral Relations By Their Positions And The Relations In Depth By Their Values, Until The Whole Space Is, So To Speak, Modelled, The White Paper Playing A Considerable Part In The Forms Created. When The Process Is Completed The Picture Is Finished. Though Corroborative Detail May Be Added. The Reason Why Watercolour Seems More Suitable For This Process Than Oil Is That It Lends Itself To A Further Degree Of Abstraction. A Streak Of Oil Pigment 9N Canvas Needs More Explanation Thanl A Stain Of Water-Colour On Paper. And, Therefore, One Feels That Oil Painting Requires A More Imitative Treatment, To Lean More Heavily Upon The Facts Of Nature. But In These Water-Colours There Is Nothing To Disturb Our Pleasure In Following The Artist In His Rhythmical Evolutions Through Space. His Allusions To Nature, However Remnote, Are Perfectly Understood Through The Nature Of The Medium, And There Is No Unorganized Material To Be Explained Away. Canary, In A Darkly Framed Window, Shows How Strongly The Method Can Be Used Without The Need For Literalness In Representation, And There Are Several Pictures-Perhaps View Of Garden Goes Farthest-Which Display Its Possibihties In Considered Slightness. Steps Under Trees May Be Named For Its Musical Rhythm, And Avenuie By The Stream For Its Fullness Of Representation. Five Designs For Scenes From King Lear, Made For The Players Shakespeare, Published By Messrs. Benn, Are Included In The Exhibition. In The Other Rooms There Is The First Exhibition Of Ol Paintings By Mr. Adrian Daintrey. -His Gifts Are A Quick Grasp Of The Subject As A Whole, A Vigorous Method Of Brush Construction, And A Remarkably Truesense Of Values -Enabling Him To Get Lively -Effect. Without Incoberence. Vivacity Is, Indeed, The Prevailing Character In The Exhibition, The Works Include Portraits, Landscapes, And Stl-Life Subjects, And The Dachshiind, On A Sun-Splashed Road, The Railway Bridee, Moret-Sur-Loing, Lollingdoo, And Winter Scene May Be Picked Oub As Good Examples.

Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1930-Jul-22,"London, England","Art Exhibitions The Goupil Gallery Mr. Hyam Myer, Whose Oil Paintings Are To Be Seen At The Goupil Gallery, 5, Regent-Street, Employs Rather Florid Curves Which He Obtains By Bold Distortions. Every Part Of His Pictures Is Connected By These Flowing Lines. But If The Structure Of His Pictures Is Almost Florid The Execution Of Them Is The Reverse. His Colours Are Often Harsh And Uncompromising, And In The Quality Of His Paint, Which Seldom Has A Soft Or Agreeable Surface, He Makes No Concessions. Catalan Woman Is Perhaps The Most Extreme Example Of These Two Apparently Contradictory Aims, Which Are Here More Or Less Reconciled. This Taste For Rude Vigour Which Comes Out In The Colouring Nnd Texture Of His Pictures Also Affects The Choice Of His Subjects. He Seems To Delight In Viewpoints And Positions Which Accentuate The Harshness Of Everything Which He Sees. But In Some Of His Landscapes, Where, Curiously Enough, He Does Not Indulge In Very Sweeping Curves, He Does Indulge In Delicate And Agreeable Colour. At The Same Gallery 3Miss Dora Crockett The Countess Eric Lewenhaupt Shows A Number Of Oil Paintings And Water-Colours. Many Of These Are Rather Bare And Strict Structures, And Often The Rough Surface Of The Canvas, Not Filled In With Paint, Accentuates Their Austerity. But This Austerity Is Often, And Especially In Some Mountainous Scenes, Turned To Dramatic Ends. At Other Times, As In Giverny, A More Subtle Feeling For Tones And Colour Changes The Whole Character Of The Picture. The Watercolours Are Also Much More Soft And Gentle. And The Paint Has Been Laid On Damp So As To Take A Pleasant Surface. Mr. Charles Tharp The Portraits In Mr. Charles Tharps Exhibition Of Portraits And Other Works At Coolings Galleries, 92, New Bond-Street, Are Greater In Number And Importance Than The Other Works. In Fact, Mr. Tharp Is Very Definitely A Portrait Painter. But He Has Made An Effort To Bring The Ordinary Portrait Of To-Day Into Line With More Traditional Kinds Of Painting, An Attempt Certainly Well Worth Making. In The Main Mr. Tharp Contents Himself With Painting, As Vasari Would Have Put It, In The Modern Manner, Though He Does Not Take This Very Far. But He Paints With Freedom, His Colours Are Often Bright, And There Is Some Considerable Difference Betwveen His Portrait Of The Late Viscount Cowdray, A Perfectlv Conventional If Competent Portrait, And Many Of His Other Works. Too Often His Search For Greater Freedom Has Led Him To Leave His Pictures Unfinished, And Even Where Every Part Of The Canvas Is Covered With Paint One Has The Impression That Had Mr. Tharp Put A Finer Polish Upon His Work And Included More Detail The Conventional Portrait Would Have Emerged. Nevertheless, In These Rougher Portraits The Colour Is Often Attractive, And In The Heads, If Not In The Rest Of The Picture, There Is Sometimes A Certain Grasp Of The Structure, As In The Portrait Of The Late Rev. A. V. 3Iagee. In His Other Works 3Mr. Tharps Sense Of Colour Is Allowed More Play, As In Siesta, While The Colour Of The Skv In Portland Place Is An Interesting Invention. Modern Japanese Prints At Yamanaka And Co.S Galleries, 127. New Bond-Street, Is An Interesting Exhibition Of Modern Japanese Colour Prints, Planned, As We Are Told In A Foreword To The Catalogue, As A Protest Against The Assumption That The Glory Of Japanese Colour Printing Has Faded Away. . . It Chiefly Consists Of The Work Of Kobayashi Kiyochika, Who Worked During The Period 1868-1912 And So Encountered The Influence Of The Yest. His Technique Remained For Long Almost Entirely Oriental, But Bis Subjects Were Changed. He Worked For His Countrymen And Depicted Steamships, European Houses, And So Forth. At The Same Time He Adventured With Thunderstorms, Fireworks, And Fires. His Representations Of Modern Objects Have A Curiously Naive And Childlike Effect, And I From This He Seems To Have Derived A Pleasant Decorative Method. His Drawing Is Often Naive Enough Even When He Is Not Depicting Unoriental Objects, Asin Mandai Bridge-Dawn. With All His Eastern Technique He Often Approaches Near To The Simpler And Less Sophisticated European Colour Prints Of The Same Period. But Later He Seems To Have Grown More Sophisticated And To Have Introduced More Important Realistic Effects Into His Prints. Thus Evening On The Sumida River No. 22 Still Appears Perfectly Japanese In Technique, Hut The Treatment Of Space Is Actuallv European In Feeling.

Null,The Dudley Gallery,The Times,1882-Mar-07,"London, England","The Dudley Gallery. I The 18Th General Exhibition Of Wvater-Colour Drawings At The Dudley Gallery Certainly Does Not Fall Below The Usual Level Of Excellence. In The Single Room Are Gathered Together Some 640 Drawings Of Au Sorts And Sizes, From Mr. Herkomers Minute Painting Ort Ivory To Mr. Joseph Knights Large Mountain Landscspe And If Among All Theso There Is Nothing Of The Very Highest Quality, At Least There Is Singularly Little Really Bad Workmanship. There Are Times, Indeed, When One Is Tempted To Echo The Complaint Of M. Claretie, The French Critic, Against The Enormous Fertility Of Modern Art. Sixty Thousand Pictures, Good And Bad, Produced Every Year In Paris Alone ! What Will Posterity Do With Them All ? Yet It Is Better To Trust Posterity To Solve Its Own Problems, Anl Meanwhile To Enjoy The Best Of What Our Painters Provide For Us. So Long As The Average Continues To Rise We May Be Content To Reflectthat This Means An Increased And Extended Interest In Art And Wider Facilities For Art Training. And That The Average Is Rising Is Eviaent To Any One Who Enters A Gaflerv Like This And Compares What He Sees In It With What He Would Have Seen If Ten, Twenty, Thirty Years Ago He Had Found Himself, Not In An Exhibition Of The Works Of A Few Picked Men, But In A General Exhibition Open To All Comers And Frequented For The Most Part By Young Painters. There Can Be No Question That The Improvement In Drawing, Colouring, And In Composition Has Been Steadyin Other Words, That Water-Colour Art Has Felt The General Intellectual Movement Of Which We Are Hardly Conscious, Because We Live In The Midst Of It. Southey, In 1818, Speaking Of The Many Volumes Of Poetry Which Were Then Appearing Without Bringmg Their Writers Either Notice Or Reward, Says,- There Is Not One Of The Whole Number Which Would Not Have Excited Attention And Secured A Remnuneration To The Author Had It Been Published 80 Yesrs Ago. Fortunately For The Painters, There Is A Better Market For Their Works Than There Was For Poetry In 1818 But The Tone In Which The Mass Of Them Are Sometimes Spoken Of Is Hardly Less Disparaging Than That In Which The Critics Then Spoke Of The Poetry Of The Day. They May Console Thomselves With Adapting Southeys Saying To Their Own Case. Judged By The Standard Of To-Day, There Is Nothing Exceptional In This Exhibition At The Dudley Gallery But None The Less, It Contains At Least Fifty Drawings Which, If They Had Appeared As The Work Of New Men In 1850,Would Have Arrested Everybodys Attention. At One Time The Exhibitions At The Dudley Gallery Showed The Prevailing Inflaence Of One School-In Fact, Inclined To Cliquishness. There Is No Sign Of This Now. The Direct Inheritors Of The Pre-Raphaelite Tradition Have Gone Elsewhere - And The Impressionist School, Which Triumphs In Some Foreign Galleries, Is Not Represented To Any Great Extent. There Are Exceptions, Such As Mr. R. W. Allan, Whose Views Of Seville And Venice Are Decidedly Interesting Mr. Melville, Whose 1 Turkish Bath Is A Fine Piece Of Colour, And Signor Cabianca, Of Whose Venetian Scene The Same May Be Said Mr. Edwin Ellis. Whosa Arawing Must Trankly Be Pronounced A Failure And Liss Macaulay, Who Should Take Warning In Time Aainst Caricaturing The Style Of Miss Montalba. Tbut The Mass Of The Best Work Here Belongs To A Different School-That Which Aims At Hitting The Mean Between The Neglect Of Detail And The Slavish Adherence To It-That, In Fact, Which Tries To Forget Neither The Whole Nor The Parts, Neither The Total Effect Nor The Details Which Go To Make It. Such Is The Work Of The Brothers Severn, Of Mr. F. Walton, In A Certain Degree Of Mr. Alfred Parsons, Of Mr. H. M. Marshall, And Of Many Others Of The More Remark-Able Exhibitors. In A Class By Themselves Stand The Two Drawings Of Mr. Ruskin, Which The Gallery Has Had The Good Fortune To Secure. Beginning With The Left-Hand Wall We Come Upon Mr. C. Earles Near The Lands End, Which, With The Penborth Cove 292 Of The Same Painter, May Be Profitably Compared With The Very Similar But Finer Work Of Mr. F. Walton No. 46, In Penborth Cove , Who Has Succeeded Better In His Rendering Of The Almost Mediterranean Blue Of The Western Sea. No. 22 Is Mr. Il W. Allans Seville, A Broadly-Treated And Almost Too Luminous Dravwing, But Not So Excessive In Brilliancy As The Fish-Stall In Venice Of The Same Painter, Where The Pavement Suggests Water Rather ,Than Sunlight. Not Far Off No. 31 Hangs What Is, Perhaps, The Best Of Mr. A.Parsonss Fourdrawins -A Delicious Study Of An Orchard In Spring. It Is Less Ambitious Than Either Of Those Opposite, But Is Certainly More Successful Than Either In Making The Spectator See What The Painter Saw -A Stretch Of May Grass, With Sheep Dotted About It, And Trees Loaded With Apple-Blossoms. Mr. Parsons Is One Of The Most Rising Of Our Landscape Painters, Whether He Uses Water Or Oil, And This Is For Its Size One Of His Most Charminlg Drawings. It Escapes, For Example, What Seems To Us The Fault Of The Neighbouring Sketch No. 48 Of Bablock Ythc, So Dear To Vjxiora Men, Wnere Ttie Heavy Cloud That Covers Half The Sky Has Not Been Allowed To Soften The ,Foo Great Brilliancy Of The Grass. Between These Two Hangs The Large Drawing Of Mr. Edwin Ellis. To Whioh We Have Already Referred, Sand Hills, North Wales -A View Of Scrub-Covered Bills, With A Shepherd And What May Be Supposed To Be His Flock Climbing Them. Mr. Ellis Has Unquestionable Talent, And Has Often Given Us Sketehes Of The Sea That Have Much Of Mr. Hooks Power And Colour In Them But There Is A Hasty Unfinished Look About All He Does Which Makes His Work Of Less Value Than It Ought To Be. These Sheep, For Exsmple, What Are They ? Turner, No Doubt Would Have Dashed Ttem In Rapidly, And Would Have Taken Little Pains With Their Proportions, And So Would David Cox But Those Painters Would Have Left It Certain That They Were Sheep, While In Mr. Elliss Hands They Might Very Well Be Insects. It Is A Pity To See So Much Ability Used To So Little Purpose As It Has Been In This Picture. Passing By Several Small And Pleasant Drawings 40, 0 Pleasant Eventide -A Town Scene, By F. Ihamilton Jackson 41, Men Were Deceivers Ever, By L. L. Pocock 47, Evening, By P. T Rrant We Come To Mr. Aspinalls Spring Scene, Ere A Leaf Is On A Bush 55.

This Small Drawing, Like No. 257 Opposite Paidington Farm, Dorking , Is One Of The Most Poetical, Refined, And Yet Perfectly True Studies To Be Found In The Gallery. Spring, With Her Rainy, Fleeting Charms, Her Promise, Her Illusions, Is Rendered In This Sketch Of The Brook Among The Hills In A Truly Delightful Manner, The Only Fault That Can Be Suggested Being, Perbaps, That The Style Is A Little Over-Laboured. Not Very Dissimilar Is The Park Gate 61, By Mr. W. F. Stocks, But This, Though Excelent In Drawing, Is Perhaps Too Artificial In Colour. No. 69, A Call Afternoon Z By E. J. Du Val, Is A Pleasant Summer Scene Of Rippling Sea With White Gulls Descending Upon It And No. 7T, Mr. F. E. Tboxs Walberwick Ferry, Is A Study Of Girla Dresses, Which In A Measure Recalls Tissot, Though Being Without That Distinguished Paintera Atmosphere. Next Jianas The Trout-Stream Of Hir. W. G. Addison, A Rich, Perhaps Over-Rich, Drawing Of A Stream With Its Bordering Of Lu.Sh Grasses, Reeds, And Yallow Iris. Like The Apple Blossom, Which Hangs Opposite, This Drawing Recaus The Style Of Alfred Parsons, But It Seems To Want The Reserve Which Is A Quality Of His Work, And Consequently To Reach A Less Degree Of Excellence. Mr. . Dillons 1 Blind Arched Gateway 73 Is A Pleasant Little Drawing Of Buildings And In Pglen Docbart 85, Mr. Fhenry Moore Leaves His Favourite Sea And Gives Us A Very Clever View Of A Highland Scene With Its Full Autumn Contrast Between The Rich Colour Of The Foreground And Tho Wnow-Covered Mountain Behind. Mr. John White Is Now A Ms Deszznis Yesr, None Of His Three Drawings Deing Equal To His Recent Work In Oils. Mr. Joseph Knights Breezy Day, And The Old Well Of His Namesake, J.W.B. Knight, Are Noticeable, And Beyond Tbem- Is One That Must Be Ranked Among The Most Remarkable Drawings In The Gallery, The Aumeris Of Mr. J. H. Hensball. It Isadrawing Of A Low-Browed-, Dark-Haired Woman, In A Richlyembroidered Dress, Who Stands On A. Marble Floor Before A Deep Purple Curtain In Feature And Expression She Is Repellent, Even Ugly, And Her Attitude Is.Poor. But In Point Both Of Painting And Colour The Drawing Stands Out As Something Quite Weitfnt From Most Of Its Neighbours. The Last Among The Drawings On This Wall Which Calls For Notice Isthat Of Mr. J. C.Dollman, Whose Humorous Gift Is Not Deserting Him. Les Misdrables Are The Master And His Dog-A Rough-Looking Master And A Villainous Dog-Turned Out Of Their Cottage, With All The Furniture, For The Weekly Cleaning. The Profound Wretchedness Of These Houseless Ones Is Admirably Rendered. The Place Of Honour At The End Of The Room Is Occupied By Mr. Josoph Knights Lingering Ligbt, A Large Drawing Of A Monntain Side, Fronted By A Dark Pool On Which The Sun Never Seems To Shine, And Itself Clotbed With Wood Till Near The Summit. On Vale And Wood The Shadow Of Night Has Fallen, But Above It The Rosy Light Of Sunset Still Lingers. The Great Solidity Of Treatment Which Mdr. Knight Has Adopted Is Unusual In Water-Colours Some Might Even Call It Illegitimate. Btit The Best Way To Discredit Bard And Fast Distinctions Between The Legitimate And The Illegitimate In Art Is To Paint A Successful Picture Which Confounds Them. M-R. Knights Drawing Is Flanked By Two, Matching In Size But A Singular Contrast In Subject, By The Brothers Arthur And Walter Severn-, Ice On The Tbames At Battersea And The Rising Tidesark. Both Of These Large And Powerful Drawings Are Well Worthy Of Their Conspicuous Position. Mr. Arthur Severns Is A Very Delicate Study Of The Misty,Waning Light Of An Evenin- Of Hard Frost Bis Brothers A View Of One Of The Nobie Promontories That Jut From The Wonderful Shore Of Sark, With The Sea Coming In So Fast And Steadily That The Spectator Almost Fears To Be Left In That Lonely Bav With All Escape Shut Off By The Rocks And The Waves. On Either Side Of These Two Drawings Are The Workx Nf Dir. Mvielville And Signor Cabianca, Of Which We Have Already Spoken. Close By Is A Charming Shore Scene, By Mr. J. 0. Long, The White Sands Of Iona And Below Mr. Knights Pictnre Is Miss M. S. Groses 1 Souvenir Of Algeria, A Very Clever Studyof Eastern Stilllife. Onthe Same Wall Are Three Small Drawings In One Frame Of The Lakce Country In Winter, By Mr. H. M. Marshall, Who Is Rapidly Earning The Position Of The Lake Painter Par Exceuence. No One Who Knowvs The Bend Of Fairfield, And Who Knows Also How Seldom Either Artist Or Photographer Succeeds In Rendering The True Proportion Of That Bend Or Of The Valley Beneath, Ought To Miss This Sketch. Wansfell Is Perbaps,A Shade Less True, But, Taken All In All, This Trio Cf Minute Drawinas Are Extremelv Successful Both As Pictures And As Renderings Of Actual Places. Lastly May Be Mentioned Mr. Talmage Whites Valley Of The Pines At Massa, Near Sorrento, A Refined And Tet Glowing Representation Of A Beautiful Italian Scene. On The Next Wall The First That Invites Attention Is Mr. A. B. Donaldsons Venetian Drawing M Murano And San Cristoforo, Very Brilliant And Faithful, In Spite Of The Depth Of Blue That To Those Wbo Do Not Know The Lagoon At Al Seasons Might Seem Exaggerated. The Same Painters View Of The Terrace Of The Pincio 368 Is Hardly So Succesful, And Provokes Inevitable Comparisons With M. Heilbuths Magnificent Drawings Of The Same Place Which Were Exhibited In London A Few Years Agc. Mr. Luther Hoopers Staple Inn, Holborn Is A Broadly-Treated And Clever Sketch Of A Part Of Old London Which Can Hardly Survive Another Genaration. Of Mr. Aspinalls Paddington Farm We Have Already Spoken. Close To It Is Oak Valley, Cannock Chase No. 259, H. Biirides. An Important Drawing With A Great Deal Of Pleasant Colour And Suiggestiveness, Though There Is An Impression Of Stippling About The Work Which Mars Its Value. The Infinite Detail Of Grass Is Not Really Attained By These Stippling Processes, And The Main Result Is A Kinl Of False Atmosphere Wbich Spoils The Picture. Mr. H. A. Harpers Larae Drawing Of Jerusalem-Sunrise 265 Is Bold And Spirited, Rendering The Character Of The Place Without Being Overladen With Detail, And Fine And Pure In Colour. Below Is Mr. H. Pilleaus Best Drawing 268, The Two Colossi, Thebesdluring The Inundation Of The Nile, Which Renders In A Singularly Successful Way The Tone Of The Egyptian Valley In Floodtime. Mr. Radcliffes Wanderers From The Flock 293 Is A Pleasant Study Of Tree Trunks, Red Leaves And Lichens, And Sheep Aud Mr. Hawksworths Small Sketch Of Limehouse 301 Is Full Of Promise. Bevond Is Iylr. .E. Watons Et And ,Ost Characteristic Lontribution, Excellently Described In The Line From Shelley Which Ho Takes For Its Title If Winter Comes, Can Spring Bo Far Behind 7- Amoug Many Other Venotian Sketches Is One Sent By Miss Leigh Smith 343, Across The Lagune And Among The Lake Drawings Is A Large And Laboured Picture Of Windermere By Mr. E. T. Compton, Who Has Succeeded Much Better With His Distanices Than With His Difficult Ferny Foreground. Mr. J. E. Graces Work Is Always Pleasant, And If Bis Veteran Of The Woods 365 Is Not One Of His Most Striking Efforts, It Is Not The Less A Clever And Attractive Sketch. Mr. Pococks Sympatby 408 Is An Attempt In The Direction Of Dramatic Painting That Cannot Be Called Altogether Successful. Mr. A. J. Watsons Mansion House 432 Is A Very Clever Study Of London Atmosphere In Rain And Miss E. Wveblings Eosalinrd May Pass For A Good Imitation Of An Early Florentine Head, Such As La Bella Simonetta, Or Some Other Imnaertal Fair One. We Have Scarcely Left Onrselves Space To Do Justico To The Many Excellent Little Wvorks That Hang On The Screens. On The First Are-To Take Uvv Lw 1L1Uullut3 01 D Yir. Jofln Efvanss Masterly Church Interiors Two Of Miss H. Thornycrofts Studies Of Orchids-Brilliant And Delicate Pieces Of Colour Which It Would Be Difficult To Surpass And Mr. B. W. Spierss Clever And Careful Bit Of Wardour-Street -A Corner In Which Are Gathered Together In Delightful Disarray An Ancient Sword, A Fiddle Perbaps This Is A Genuiie Carlo Bergonzi !, Old Engravings, Books With Fascinating Titles, Coral Beads, Coins, And China. Above It Hangs, What To Many Visitors Will Be The Most Interesting Drawing In The Gallery, Mr. Ruskins Wonderfully Elaborate In The Pass Of Killiecrankie-A Study Of Trees And Rocks, Seen With The Nicroscopic Eye Of The Great Critic. The Other Screen, Which Is Devoted To Drawings Of The Snrallest Size, Is Itself Sufficient To Occupy The Visitor Through A Pleasant Half-Hour. Mr. J. 0. Long Has Another Iona Sketch 536, Below Which Nangs A Clever And Amusing Drawing Called Conceit By Mr. J.A.Fitzgerald-A Negro Dressing Up In His Masters Finery, To His Own Intense Satisfacthon. Mr. E. Waterlows Shady Spot Miss P. Townsends Street In Scheveningen And Mr. Marshalls On The Medway Are Noticeable Among The Drawings On The One Side Of The Screen. The Other Side Is Richer, For There Are Two Gems Of Mr. Arthur Severns, A Tiny Drawing By Mr. Ruskin, Mr. Raerkomers Bread And Sunshine --A Miniature On Ivory Of A Bavarian Boy Enjoying His Middav Meal In Freedom-And Many Others Of High Quality. Of The Monaco And Monte Carlo Of Mr. Severn It May Be Truly Said-And No Higher Praise Could Be Given-That He Has Succeeded In Adequately Rendering What Is, Perhaps, The Most Beautiful Spot In Europe, Its Dazzling Sea, The Exquisite Lines And Colours Of Its Infinitely Varying Shore, And Its Heavonly Atmosphere. Mr. T. G. Linnells Scotch Firs Is A Brilliant Little Drawing, And Mr. J. Hardwicke Lewiss Man In Blue Is A Work Whicb, If We Cannot Say Of It, In The Phrase Of The French Irreconcilable, That It Is Encore Plu8 Mauvais Que Meissonier, Is Yet An Exceedingly Strong And Careful Bit Of Painting In The Style Of The French Figure Painters. To Conelude, We May Mention Mr. Houghs Basket Of Plums, Than Which-Assuming That Plums Are A Worthy Subject For Art-Nothing Could Be More Successful. Indeed, In Subjects Of This Kind The Gallery Is Rich, For, Besides Those We Have Mentioned Already, The Flower Pieces Of Mr. Mitchell, Mr. David Carr, Miss Kate Sadler, Miss Scott, Miss Maud Naftel, Miss L3. Parsons, Miss A. Moore, Miss V. Lindsay, And, Above All, Of Mrs. Martineau, Are Of Remarkable Excellence.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS67289703/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=ebb5bb3e,,

Carr Mr. Thomas Carr, 30 Of Whose Paintings Are On View At The Redfern Gallery, 20, Cork Street, W.1, Is An Artist With A Pleasing Gift Of Bright, But Not Garish, Colour. He Has, Too, A Strongly Developed Sense Of Silhouette, Which Influences The Composition Of Many Of His Most Attractive Pictures. The Latter Characteristic Is Very Noticeable In Such Things As Marine Parade, Dover, Which Is An Arrangement Of Figures Silhouetted Against Houses, Which In Their Turn Are Outlined Against Cliffs And Pierrots, A Lively And Decorative View Of A Seaside Entertainment, With Both Performers And Audience Seen From The Side-An Approach Which May Possibly Have Been Suggested By A Well Known Picture By Mr. Sickert. Another Delightful Picture Of Mr. Carrs, In Somewhat The Same Manner, Is Children Paddling While A Fresh And Charming Nude, Girl In Bed, And An Agreeable Portrait, Sally, Illustrate Other Aspects Of His Work. In An Adjoining Room Is A Small Selection Of Paintngs And Drawings, Some Of Them Completely Abstract, By Nine English Painters-A Selection Which Is Shortly To Be Exhibited In America. The Abstractionists Include Mr. John Tunnard Not Quite At His Best Mr. Ben Nicholson, Showing Some Of His Painted Reliefs Made Up Chiefly Of Superimposed Rectangles Of White, Grey, Brown, And Red Miss Barbara Hepwortb, Whose Drawings For Sculpture Rather Suggest Infinitely Neat Geometrical Problems And Mr. Alastair Morton. Mr. Graham Sutherland And Mr. Henry Moore Are, As It Were, Only Semi-Abstract In Their Exhibits-And Perhaps Therefore Less Easy To Understand. Mr. Sigmund Pollitzer Contributes Some Surrealist Drawings Done With A Very Delicate Pencil Line. Mr. Paul Nashs Watercolours Show Once Again His Soft And Lovely Sense Of Colour And Include An Amusing Beetles Eye View, So To Speak, Of A Group Of Toadstools.

There Is Variety Of Medium-I-Painting, Sculpture, Engraving, Pottery, Jewelry, And Mietalwork-But Very Few Of The Exhibitors Seem To Be Aware Of The Truthl Contained In Mir. Charles Jobnsons Recent Book On English Painting, That The Miniature Should Be Something Otlher Than Fullsized Portraituie Reduced In Scale. What Is Generally Wanting-In All Mediums-Is A Convention Adapted To The Scale, And, So Far As Painting Is Concerned, To Find A Good Miniature Convention It Is Not Necessary To Go Fartber Than Nicholas Hilliard, Who Laid It Down That The Lyne Without Shadowe Showeth All To Good Judgment, But The Shadowe Without Lyne Showoth Nothing. To Judge By This Exhibition Miniature Painting Began With Samuel Cooper, Though Cosway Is The Liore Favourite Model. One Of The Best Groups, That By The Late Mrs. A. E.

The Title Suggests Rather More Tha L Was Perhaps Intended, For There Can Be Little Doubt That The Work Of Such Artists As Mr. Nazsh Gains By Sonic Definite Application. It Is Worth Remarking, By The Way, That The Disadvantage Of Abstract Painting Is Not Unlikeness To Nature-A Mosaic Or A Stained Glass Window Is Unlikc Nature In That Sense-But Comparative Unlikeness To Drawing And Painting. In The Case Of The Mosaic Or The Window The Intractability Of The Materials, Easily Recognized By The Simplest Person, Explains The Abstraction, But In The Case Of The More Flexible Mediunm There Is Not The Same Explanation, And The Abstraction Seems Intellectually Rather Than Artistically Determined, At The Expense Of The Medium. But When Mr. Nasli Makes Wood Engravings Or Designs For The Stage Or For Book Decoration, The Circumstances Again Explain The Style, And There Is No Feeling Of A Deliberate Avoidance Of Naturalism. The Most Striking Things In This Exhibition Are The Four Sketch Designs For The Decoration Of Sir Thornas Browvnes Urn Burial And The Garden Of Cyrus. Here Not Only The Style But The Artistic Convention-Roughly That Of Surrealism, Or The Bringing Together Of Objects By Their Subconsciously Felt Association Ratlher Than By Their Consciously Observed Relationseems Exactly Right.

Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1933-Apr-26,"London, England","Entertainments Art Exhibitions The French Gallery The Connecting Link Between The Nine Artists Exhibiting Paintings And Drawings At The French Gallery, 11, Berkeley Square, Is That They Are All More Or Less Recent Graduates Of The Royal College Of Art. Certainly The General Character And Quality Of Their Work Do Credit To That Institution. Graduates, On Reflection, Might Give The Wrong Impression, And The Stage Of Accomplishment Reached Is More Like That Of The Journeyman Painter Under The Good Old Guild System. That Is To Say, The Young Artists Are Out Of Their Apprenticeship But Are Not Yet Masters And This Description Will Suggest Very Conveniently The Kind Of Opportunity Presented To The Discriminating Buyer Or Commissioner Of Pictures. Mr. Barnet Freedman Is The Best Known Of The Nine, And He Appears Here As A Forcible And Accomplished Realistic Painter. His Two Sicilian Puppets Is A First-Rate Piece Of Stilllife Painting, With The Dramatic Effect In The Design Proper To The Subject. There -Is, As Is Common In This Kind Of Work-Based On Visual Rather Than Mental Grasp Of The Mnaterial-Some Uncertainty Of Relationship Between The Puppets And The Panelled Wall-Or Door-Against Which They Are Suspended, But It Is A Minor Defect, And In The Wood, By The Same Artist, With Sharp Lights Through The Trees Reflected In A Pond, Is A Very Good Landscane. Mlr. G. Ososki, Though He Also May Be Called A Realist, Is More Intellectual In His Treatment Of Form, And His Portrait Of The Artists Brothcr Has A Conscious Insistence On The Volumes To Which The Colour Aptly Contributes. It Is Evident That The Common Apprenticeship Has Not Destroyed Individuality, For Each Of The Artists Has His Own Way Of Doing Things. Mr. P. Horton Draws Carefully-His The Garden Path Is Worthi Looking Out Among The Drawings-And Paints, As In The Ironing Board, With Full Gradations While Mr. D. Towner. In Snow On Hampstead Heath And The Garden, 16, Church Row. Hampstead, Seems To Aim At The Values Of Open Tones. Eileen Glane. By Mr. H. Finney, Xwcst Wittering Church, By Mvr. G. Rhoades, Autumn, By Mr. C. Mahoney. Still Life, By Mr. A. Flouthuesen, And Figure Study 2, By Mir. Nf. Rothenstein, Well Represent The Other Exhibitors. Tie Combined Effect Of Young Artists Ready For Employment Makes It Difficult To Understand The Complaints One Hears Of Shirking In The Present Generation. If Anytliing Is Lacking Here It Is Certainly Not Grounding In The Craft. At The Same Gallery There Is An Exhibition Of Water-Colours And Sculpture By Mr. Trevor Tennant. Here, Again, The Imprcssion Is Not So Much Of Very Great Talent As Of General Capability, With An Intelligent Eye To Applications And A Sensible Preparation For Such Opportunities As May Arise. Mr. Tennant Is A Good Carver, Particularly In Wood, And His Work In That Material Appears To Gain In Proportion As It Accepts The Naturalistic Suggestion Of The Grain Rather Than When It Is Aimed At More Abstract Formal Effects. Male Torso, In Yew, And Madonna And Child, In Elm, May Be Quoted. Not That Torso, In Sycamore, Is Not An Exceedingly Graceful Piece Of Simplification-And There Is Good Work In All The Pieces-But That The Dislike Of Representational Interest, Which Seems To Be Constitutional With The Present Generation, Leaves Sculptire Somewhat At A Loose End. If The Aim Be Abstract Form, Why All That Solid Niaterial ? As In The Case Of Painting, The Logical Conclusion Is Architectural Application, Which Explains Away The Material, And Mr. Tennant Seems To Be Alive To This, For Several Of His Pieces, Capital And Panels For A Cottage Fireplace, For Example, Are Designed For An Architectural Setting. His Water-Colours Show The Sculptors Instinct In Their Effort To Define Space Relations By Means Of Colour-As In Harvest In Sussex And Road To Stopham. They Are Most Attractive, However, When This Worthy Aim Is Associated With The Free Calligraphy Which Water-Colour Asks For -As In River At Midhurst And The Rother.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS235481242/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=e4628d39,,

Flexibility Is As Good A Word As Any To Describe The Eharacteristio Attraction In The Work Of Miss Flora Lion. Hitherto We Have Known Her Almost Exclusively As A Portrait Painter And Draughtswoman, But The Present Exhibition Of 53 Works By Her At Barbizon House, 9,Henrietta-Street, Cavendish-Square, Includes Landscape And Flower Paintings As Well, And They Pleasantly Enlarge The Impression Made By Her Talent. For Practical Purposes Miss Lion Is A Designer In Two Dimiensions, And This, While It May Indicate Some Weakness Of Grasp, Is A Positive Advantage To The Appearance Of Her Exhibition As A Whole. The Walls Are Alive With A Decorative Play Of Line And Colour, But Nothing Comes Forward Into The Room And, In Present Conditions Of Living, The Gain Iln Comfort-Particularly On The Usual Scale Of Portraiture-.More Than Makes Up For The Limitation. As A Portrait Painter We Like Miss Lion Bestwhen She Is Least Like Sir John Lavery, Ra. This, By The Way, Is Not A Backhander At That Eminent Artist, But Only To Suggest That Miss Lions Talent Is Of 3 Different Order, More Sensitive In Line, Mnore Varied In Colour-In A Word, More Feminine And Positive Femininity In Art Is Rare Enough To Be Welcomed With Both Hands. Her Paintings Of Women And Ehildren, In Particular, Fore Intensely Sym-. Pathetic, In Both Character And Arrangement-As If The Artist Painted Clothes And Personal Surroundings In The Spirit In Which They Were Chosen By The Owner. The Designs Are Not Very Complex, But Much Is Made Of Little, With Chief Reliance Upon Responses In Colour. The Most Attractive Portrait Here Is That Of Mrs. Frank Schwab, In White Against A Green Background, Very Well Judged In Tone. The Arms Hang Loosely, And Slightly Outwards, And The Green Of The Back. Ground Is Artfully Brought In By Concrary Movement In A Criss-Cross Of Green Trimming On The Full Skirt. Another Excellent Portrait Is That Of Lady Davis, In A Scale Of Greys, With Her Little Terrier, The Green Of A Spanish Comb Being Repeated In The Collar Of The Animal. In The Landscapes There Is More Penetration Into Depth, But The Attraction Is Still That Of Skilfully Related Colour Values. Isla Di Pescatori, Maggiore Is The Most Solid In Composition, But Evening, Lago Mag. Giore, Primarily A Study Of Space And Light, And Foscari Palace, Vrenice, A Study Of Reflection, Excel It In Charm. From The Flower Paintings Iceland Poppies And White Tulips May Be Picked Out, The Last Being A Little Overweighted By Its Brownish-Purple Background.

It Is Not A Mere Contrast But A True Comparison Of Two Different Impulses Within What Is Unmistakably The Same School Of Painting. In The One Case There Is An Advance To Colour Through Firm Planning In Tone. And In The Other The Colour Attack Is Direct, With The Drawing Loosened In Sympathy. The Comparison Is Most Pointed Between The Two Figure Subjects, Christine Nillson, With Guitar, By Corot, And Leducation De La Vierge, By Delacroix, Because In The Forwer, A Half-Length Recalling The Pearl In General Composition, Corot Comes As Near To Positive Colour As He Ever Did, And The Reds In The Two Pictures Are Somewhat Similar. In The Delacroix The Figures Are Placed Side By Side In Landscape, But There Is No Division Of Interest. Most Of The Pictures In The Exhibition Arc Unfamiliar, And Le Rtuisseau And La Couir Au Nuits, Normandie,- By Corot, And Junioni Et Eole And Lermite De Copmanhurst Et Le Chevalier - An Illustraltion To Scotts Ivanhoe -By Delacroix, May Be Picked Otit For Special Mention. The Exhibition Includes A Landscape Drawing By Corot And Five Water-Colours Of Arab Subjects By Delacroix. Mir. Philip Nesbirt It Wvould Be Difficult To Say Why The 41 Eccentric Watcr-Colours By Mlr. Philip Nesbitt At The Leicester Galleries Strike One As Character Istically American Except That They Seem Invented Rather Than Imagined, With Their Humorouis Point In Matter-Of-Fact Understatement. Otherwise Tiley Bespeak The Experienced Decorator, And Many Of Them Are Pleasingly Intense In Colour. Fan Ling People. Tahitian Scene. Tea In Ihe Jtiingle, Ald Conscience.

Having A Profound Knowledge Of Architecture, Mr. Loukomski Is Able To Combine Veracity With Freedom In His Representations, I.. Which Some Heaviness Of Tone, If Pictorially To Be Regretted. Is Felt To Be In Accord With Ihc Character Of The Subjects. It Is Clear That The Powers Of The Artist Rise In Proportion To The Quality Of The Architecture, And The Centre Of Interest In The Exhibition Is The Group Of Six Diraxings Of Somerset House. Miss Susan Palmer Freshness Of Outlook, Charm Of Colour, And Freedom Of Style Are Combined In The 40 Pastels By Miss Susan Palmer At The Storran Gallery, 5, Albany Court Yard. Miss Palmer Appears To Have A Natural Turn For The Baroque In Architecture. And Some Of Her Happiest Effects Are From Churches In Rome. Dome Of Saintandrea Al Quirinale. Seen In Perspective As A Gold Spiral, Comes First. But S. Maria Dellorto, St. Peters, Interior, Dome In Rome, And Apse Of The Gesu, Rome Are All Excellent Studies. It Is Not. Usual To Comment On Prices, But Miss Palmers Lyrical Freshness Is Equalled By The Modesty Of Her Expectations. At The Same Gallery There Are 17 Interesting Figure Compositions In Gotiache By A Young French Painter, M. Mablord. A Hint Of Manets Dejeuner Sur Therbe In One Of Them Leads Back To What Seems To Be The Common Inspiration Of Them All-That Is To Say, The Giorgione Type Of Picture, With The Figure Seated On The Ground To Decide Its Characteristic Movement. Nos. 3, 5, 7, And 9 May Be Quoted. Mr. Adrian Hill The Exhibition Of 44 Water-Colours By Mtr.

Madc In Various Parts Of England And Europe, Bohemia In Particular, They Illustrate In The Most Interesting Manner The Problems That Arise In The Transference Of A Talent From One Art To Another. Some Of The Subjects Are Architectural, And In Them It Is Evident That The Artist Has Hesitated Between The Claims Of The Mistress Art And A Pictorial Impulse. Actually, With One Or Two.

Reedbuck Feeding, By Mr. John Skeaping, The White Bull, By 3Mr. W. Staite Murray-The Potter-And A Lear Subject, Blow Winds, By Mr. Edmund J. Sullivan, Are Examples.

Ralph Fisher Skelton, Who Shows Paintings And Drawings At The Twenty One Galery, 15, Mill-Street, Stri ,Es Us As Being Intended For The More Deliberate Kind Of Portraiture. He Draws Well And Firmly, And Is Clearly Interested In Character, His Weakness Being In Tone Relations, Particularly As Between Figure And Background. All His Portraits Are Better Drawn Than They Look, Owing To Parts Being Pushed Out Of Plane By False Values, And They Are Nicely Placed On The Canvas From A Lnear Point Of View. Mnime. Georges Kopp, In Costume A Study In Compared Whites, Is The Most Pleasing. Holbeinesque Is The Convenient Description For Mr. Skeltons Kind Of Portraiture.

Wyllie, R.A., At The Rembrandt Gallery, 5, Vigostreet, Cannot Fail To Give Pleasure To Anybody Witli A Taste For Shipping-Or For Riverside London, For The Matter Of That. Perhaps What Most Distinguished Mlr. Wyllie Among Artists Dealing With Similar Subjects Was The Ease With Which He Wore His Knowledge And His Complete Freedom From The Airs Of A Discoverer. Nothing Marked Him More Surely Of His Generation Than This Habit, Comparable To That Of The Older Scholars, Of Taking For Granted What People Nowadays Are Apt To Plume Themselves Upon. In The Course Of Studying His Material For Pictorial Purposes He Must Have Had Inany Adventures And Seen Strange Sights, But There Is Never A Hint In His Wvork Of What Went To The Making Of The Picture. He Would, One Feels, Have Considered It Bad Manners To Hint At The Means In Presenting The End. As Will Be Remembered, Mr. Wyllie Made His Reputation With His Painting, Noxv In The Tate Gallery, Toil, Glitter, Grime, And Wealth. It Is Represented In The Present Exhibition By An Etching, Made After It, And, Though A Good Many Deep Sea Subjects Are Included, The Exhibition Does Resolve Itself Largely Into A Series Of Impressions Of London River. There Are Several General Views, Such As Westminster From St. Iauls And The City Of London, And There Are Studies Of Most Of The Bridges. Vaterloo Bridge Was Etched As Recently As Last Year. In These Impressions Mlr. Wylie Subordinated Everything To The General Conditions Of Light, Atmosphere, And Movement, But Every Detail Is Found On Examination To Be Based Upon Intimate Knowledge. There Is Very Little Suggestion That He Was Interested In The Craft Of Etching For Its Own Sake Be Found It Suitable For His Purposes, And The Rest Was A Matter Of Getting The Maximum Of Effect Out Of The Workmanship. Many Of Us Would Prefer A Style Of Greater Economy, But, Given What Mr. Wyllie Set Out To Do, It Is Difficult To See How He Could Have Spared The Needle.

Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1890-May-10,"London, England","Abt Bxhibitions. The Perilous Honour Of Painting The Jubilee Celebration In Westminster Abbey Vwas Conferred Upon Mr. W. E. Lockhart, A Member Of The Royal Scottish Academy And Of The Royal Water-Colour Society, And An Artist Whose Work Is Favourably Known Both In Edinburgh And In London. The Picture Is Now Finished, And Is On View In A Gallery In Pall-Mall East, Which Has Been Exteraporized Out Of A Portion Of The Building Which Used To Be Known As Waterloo-House-An Excellent Gallery, By The Way, In Which Pictures Look Their Est. There Is No Need To Dwell Upon The Diifflculties Of Mr. Lockharts Task, For Every One Knows How Thanukless, Generally Speaking, Is The Labour Employed Upon The Representation Of These State Pageants. We May Say At Once That The Painter As Succeeded Better Than Almost Any Of His Predecessors Who Have Undertaken Similar Works During The Queens Reign, And That His Picture Will Stand Out, Among The Series Of Royalweddings And The Like, As The Work Of A Very Clever Artist, Who Has Known How To Compose His Picture Ingeniously And To Paint Not Inexpressive Portraits. The Artist Is Supposed To Stand On The South Side I Of The Altar In The Immediate Foreground Are The Archbishops, The Dean Of Westminster, The Bishops, Canons, And Other Clergyj Just Beyond Are Two Lines Of Royal Personages, Jgs, Princes, And Princesses, European And Lndian Her Majesty In The Coronation Chair Is In The Centre Of The Picture. To Her Left, In The North Transept, Are A Certain Number Of Members Of The House Of Commons, Easily Recognizable, And In The Gallery Overlooking The Sacrarium Are Portraits Of Various Yell-Known People, Such As Thelate Mr.Browning, Eir Frederic Leighton, And Afr. Irving. The Artist Had To Paint Likenesses Without Sacrificing The General Effect Of His Picture, And Mr. Lockhart May Be Congratulated On Having Satisfied The Difficult Conditions Of His Problem To An Unhopedfor Degree. His Abilities Are Also Well Shown In The Series Of Studies From The Life Which Hang Round The Gallerywalls, And In The Loan Collectionof Certain Finished Pictures In Oil And Water Colours Which Represent His Artistic Performance During The Last 15 Or 20 Years. The Studies Are Specially Life-Like It Would Be Difficult To Beat, In This Sketchy Manner, The Portraits Of Mnr. Gladstone And Archdeacon Farrar. The Jubilee Picture Is To Be Reproducede In Photogravure By The Berlin Photographic Company, But We May Remark That The Charge Which It Is Proposed To Make For The So-Called Artists Proof S-20 Gumineas-Seems To Us To Be Altogether Unwarrantable. Photogravures Cost Very Little To Produce They Are, After All, Only Photographs Slightly Touched Up By An Artist, And Printed From A Plate, And -Thereisabsolutely No Difference In Artistic Quality Between What Is Called The Artists Proof And Any Other State Of The Plate. The Summer Exhibition Of The Hanover Gallery, In New Bond-Street, Which Has Lately Opened, Contains A Certain Number Of Good Pictures, Including La Charrue, An Excellent Little Example Of Rosa Bonheur, Some Small Works By Troyon, Corot, Courbet, And Other Deceased French Masters, A Few Battle Pieces By Bernebellecour, Boutigny, And Others, And Some Works Of A Very Clever Parisian Painter, Raffaeli, Including A Rather Vulgar Caricature Of A Salvation Army Meeting. Some Large Pictures Of The Nude By Professor Graef, Of Berlin, Are Also Included In The Exhibition. Among These Is One Called The Persecution Of Fantasy, Which He Painted As A Satire Upon Those Who Had Brought Certain Charges Against Him For Which He Was Put On His Trial. The Morals Of The Pictures May Pass, But The Art Is Heavy And Germanic. The Best Of Herr Graefs Pictuires, That Which He Calls Milbrchen 48, Represents An Entirely Unpaintable Subject, And Fails To Tell Its Own Story. One Turns From It With Relief To The Rosa Bonheur Of Which We Have Spoken, And To The Lovely Corot Opposite One Of Those Silvsry And Transparent Studies Of Moist Light In -Which The Oldl Painter Showed His Astonishing Mastery Of The Brush. At The Fine Art Societys Gallery, In New Bond-Street, The Large Room Is Now Siled With Pictures And Sketches Of Animal Life By The Wellknown Belgian Orbelgian-Dutchpainter, Madame Henriette Ronner. Individual-Pictures Of Hers Have Frequently Been Seen In The Loaddon Exhibitions, But This, Wve Believe, Is The First Time That A Collection Of Them Has Been Brought Together Here. She Has Few Rivals In The Painting Of Cats, Especially Those Soft Persian Cats And Kittens Which Look So Innocent In Their Drawing-Room Surroundings, And Which Yet Possess Such Infinite Possibilities Of Taischief And Worse. A Turbulent Family 65-Kittens Rolling Over And Around An Empty Cage, A Longing Look 70-A Persian Cat With All Her Tigerish Instincts Aroused By The Sight Of A Canary Whats Oclock ? 76-Kittens Wreaking Their Wicked Will Upon A Fine Old Timepiece In Pictures Like This Madame Ronner Is At Her Best. She Is A Trained Observer Of The Forms And Manners Of Animals, And As A Colourist Her Achievement Is Considerable. Some Pictures Of Dogs Are Portraits Painted For The Queen Of The Belgians And The Countess Of Flanders, And Are Goqd In Their Way, But They Hardly Show The Sympathetic Skill Which Wenotice In The Painters Cat Pictures. In This Latter Department She Is, As The Writer Of The Note To The Catalogue Says, A Rival Of Eugbne Lambert, Though In Delicacy And Lightness Of Touch The Water-Colours Of The Latter Painter Are Supreme. We Are Glad That London Should Have A Sight Of Mr. Miadox Browns New Fresco Before It Takes Its Place In The Series Which This Veteran Artist Has Now Nearly Comnpleted For The Manchester Townhall. It Is True That It Cannot Be So Well Judged In Messrs. Dowdeswells Gallery, Where It Is Now Exhibited, As It Nvill Be Gn Situ, With The Appropriate Surroundings Of The Building For Which It Is Intended, But This Composition, Representing The Incident In Old Manchester History Of John Kay At Work Upon His Loom, Is Still Very Interesting, Wherever One Sees It. The Characteristics Of Hitr. Madox Browns Art Are Well Known, And The Eact That He Represents A School Which Has Now Few Professors Among Us Ought Not To Lessen Our Appreciation Of The Picture. Mr. William Strang, To Whose Plates We Have Frequently Called Attention At The Society Of Painter-Etchers, Has Now Exhibited A Complete Series Of His Etchings At Mr. Dunthornes Gallery In Vigo-Street. No Fewer Than 150 Plates Bear Witness To The Industry As Well As To The Talent Of This Excellent Pupil Of Professor Legros, Who Seems Onlv To Want Self-Confidence And A Resolve To Proceed Independently To Place Him Very High Among The Etchers Of To-Dii.Y.

Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1901-Jan-31,"London, England","Art Exhibitions. Nothing Could, Form A Better Supplement To The? Exhibition At Burlington-House Than The Collection Of English Water-Colour Ait During The 19Th. Century, Which Is Being Shown By The Fine Art Society, In Their Rooms In New Bond-Street. It Has Been Formed On A Deliberate Plan, And, Atleast Bo Far As Deceased, Artists Are Concerned, No Pains Have Been Spared To Make It Really Representative, The First Room Is Hung With The Drawings Of The Early Painters, The Men Whose Glory It Is To Have Founded The English School Which Was Afterwards To Be Enriched And Strengthened Bythe Genius Of Turner And David Cox. It Would Not Be Easy To Find Better Examples Of Such Men As J. R. Cozens And Paul Sandby Than, We Can See In This Room, And If In Looking At Them We Cannot Quite Understand The Enthusiasm Which Led Constable To Speak Of Cozens As The Greatest Genius That Ever Touched Landscape, We Can At Least Admire The Simplicity And Purity Of The Talent Which Produced These Delicate Southern Drawings. His Palette Was Very Limited, But, As Mr. Roget And Other Historians Have Pointed Out, This Was A Necessity In Those Days, When The Manufacture Of Colours For The Water-Colour Artist Was Very Much Restricted. The Chief Beauty Of Cozenss Drawings, The Beauty Which So Greatly Commended Them To Turner That He Condescended To Copy A Great Number Of Them, Lies In Their Transparency And Atmospheric Depth. In This He Was Supreme Till Turner Came, Whereas Paul Sandby, Malton, And Others, By Whom There Are Excellent Works To Be Seen Here, Excelled In Their Drawings Of Buildings And In Placing Figures In Their Landscapes In A Manner Full Of Life And Character- Others Of The Early Men, Who Are Well Represented Here, Are John Varley, And, A Little Later, George Barret, Of Whose Luminous Skies And Somewhat Conventional Compositions There Are Several Fine Examples. By Girtin, Who Might Have Been So Great Had He Lived Longer, There Is Unfortunately Nothing Very Remarkable. J. M. Wright, The Genre Painter, Has One Very Clever Drawing But All These Are Preludes To The Great Period Represented In The Next Room, Where A Few Fine. Turners, Some Noble Works By Cox And De Wint, And Other Drawings By Their Contemporaries Lead On To The Last Generation, Where Thomas Collier And H. G. Hine Among The Landscape Painters, And G. J. Pinwell Among The Imaginative Figure Painters, Are Conspicuous. It Is Pleasant To See Again Pinwells Two Drawings In Illustration Of The Pied Piper, Drawings So Well-Known From The Etchings Had The Artist Been As Happily Inspired And As Thorough, In His Other Works As He Is In These Brilliant Performances, His Name Would Have Ranked Quite As High As That Of Frederick Walker. A Little Group Of Early Drawings By Rossetti And Burne-Jones Fitly Brings This Little Collection Of Deceased Masters Works To A Conclusion, And Leads To An Interesting Roomful Of Drawings By The Men Of To-Day. We Cross The Street And Find Ourselves, By Way Of An Extreme Contrast, Among The French Impressionists, Brought Together In The Hanover1 Gallery. It Is Curious Indeed That Both The English Water-Colour School And The French Impressionists Owe Much To The Same Mighty Genius,, That Of Turner. But They Read The Lesson Of Thorn Aster Very Differently. The Story Goesprobably There Is Not Much Truth In Itthat Claude Monet I Became An Impressionist After A Visit To The Turner Boom At The National Gallery Certainly His Effort From The Beginning Has Been To Grapple More And. More With The Same Problem Which Vexed The Mind Of Turner Throughout His Latter Years, The Problem Of Painting Light. It Is Said By One Of The Newest Of French Critics, M. Etienne Bricon, In His Recently-Published Psychologic Dajrt, That Monet Owed Much, To The Veteran Chemist Chevreul And His Researches Into The Laws Of Colour, And That The Efforts Of The Painter Have Been A Never-Ending Effort To Express In Art Some Of The Variety In Tones Which Chevreul Proved To Exist Even In What Seem To Be Uniformly-Coloured Natural Objects. Whether His Efforts Will Ever Commend Themselves To The London Public, As, Thanks To The Guidance Of Some Clever Writers And The Enthusiasm Of Some Young Painters, They Have Done To The Public Of Paris And New York, May Well Be Doubted. But In Such Work As Geltie Blanche, Giverny 19, In The Quiet And. Beautifully Composed Landscapes Of Sisley, And In The Charming Portraits Of M. Renoir, Even Those Whose Eye Has Been Trained To Admire De Wint And Constable And Millais May Find An Art That Is Interesting And Undoubtedly Sincere. Two Small Shows In Bond-Street Claim A Visit And A Few Words. At Messrs. Dowdeswells, Mr. C. J. Collings Has Some Landscape Drawings Of A Kind That Is At Once Individual And Charming, Deriving Not A Little From Modern Impressionist Methods, But Evidently The Work Of A Trained Draughtsman. At No. 118, Mr. J. B. Yeats Shows A Few Sketches Of Life In The West Of Ireland. Very Modern Also And Very Clever, Especially The Horses And The Men Who Are Watching Them. In The Haymarket, At Messrs. Tooths, M. Georges Scott, A French Artist Who Has Been To South Africa, Has Three Well-Painted War Pictures, Representing Elandslaagte.The Surrender Of Cronje, And The Final Crossing Of The Tngela, Like All Pictures Which Aim At Representing The Clear Southern Atmosphere, These Are A Little Raw In Colour But As Pictures Of Events They Are Spirited And Impressive.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS34007103/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=89930eda,,

Except A Fewv Of The Flower Studies, Such As The Group By Miss Lorna Burgoyne, Which Exploit The Resources Of Line And Colour Pattern, Everything Is ,Nodelled In Light And Shade, And The Attempts To Escape Frohi This Convention By Means Of A Free Aiid Sketchy Style, As In The Work Of Mir. Chris Adams, Do Not Excite Much Enthusiasm. There Is Still The Avoidance Of A Decorative Flatness, With The Emrphasis Upon Line Drawing, Which See-Lms To Us The Ideal In Miniature Wvork. The Portrait Which Comes Nearest To The Ideal Is That Of A Boy, John Scobell Armstrong, By Miss Joan Ayling. It E Would Have Gained By A More Definitely Linear Treatnient, But With Its Colour Scheme Of Beige-Or Buff-On Green And Free Gilt Lettering On The Background, It Is A Very Charming Piece Of Work. Otherwise The Modelled Convention Has To Be Accepted, The Difference Between One Work And Another Being Mainly In Certainty Of Drawing And Comparative Looseness, Or Tightness, Of Execution. If The Work Is To Be Modelled, Or Shaded, We Do Not See Any Particular Gain In Avoiding The Peculiar Virtuosity Of The Miniature Painter, And Pi-Eference Generally Goes To Work In Which It Is Carried Pretty Far. Examples Are An Orphan, The Diploma Work Of Mviss Mabel Buchanan, Shirley, By Ntiss May B. Lee, Retta, By Miss Enid Marjorie Vale, Billie, By Nliss N. Hepburh Edmunds, And The Groups By Mr. Percy Buckman, Nirs. Violet Bruntonaugless-Wvho Pleases Bv Her Restraint In Colour-And Mrs. Nitnifred M. N.

Wilkinson Is Represented Bv Design For Titanias Palace, And There Are Illurninated Manuscripits By Miss Edith B. Crapper And Miss Jessie Bayes. M Mr. And Mrs. Blakeney Ward Not Often Is The Work Of Husband And Wife So Clearly Contrasted As It Is In The Exhibition Of Pictures By Mir. And Mrs. C. Iliakeney Ward At The Palser Gallery, 27, King Street, St. Jamess. It Is Riot Only That Mrs. Ward Shows Exclusively Portraits In Pastel, Wvhile Mr. Ward Is Represented By Andscapes And Flowver Studies In Oil, But That The Whole Character Of The Work Is Different. As Is Often The Case, The Immediate Effect Of Efficiency Is On The Ferinine Side, While Mr. Wvard Has The Advantage In Taste And Subtlety. Mrs. Ward Is, Indzed, An Extrenmely Efficient Portrait Artist. She Does Not Go Very Deep Into Character, Nor Has She Any Great Originality In Design, But She Drawvs And Constructs Well, Her Figures Are Generally Wc Planted In The Picture Space, And Her Broad Celfcts Of Colour, If Superficial, Are Generally Harmonious. H-Cr Use Of Pastel, Too, Though We Prefer Slighter E-Lects In This Medium, Is Direct And Unworried. On Its Own Lines Mrs. Tyiden, Ih Red Against A Dark Blue Background, Is An Immensely Competent Portrait, And As Examples Of Grcater Freedohl, With More Research In Colour, The Half-Lengths Of Miss Helena Perrott And Miss Peggy Black May Be Named. That Mrs. Ward Herself Would Prefer A Slighter Use Of Pastel Is Suggested B The Delightful Head Of The Spanish Baby. To Turn To The Work Of Mr. Ward Is To Exchange Evident Skill For A Sensitive Taste In Colour And An Appreciation Of Subtle Rhythims In Design. Spring Garden, In Wvhich The Movement Of The Paths Is Accepted As A Theme And Continued In The Play Of Branches, Is An Almost Perfect Little Picture Of Its Kind Rotten Row 30 Years Ago Has, Besides Its Documentary Interest, Rich Qualities Of Tone, And I Plum Blossom, Sparliing In Front Of A Cottage, And Spring In Wales Are Both Excellent Smail Landscapes. The Still-Life Paintings, Too, Such As Chinese Pagoda, Screened By A Branch Of Winter Jasmine, And Flowcr Studs, In Whici Scarlet Martagon Lilies Are Patterned Upon A Silvery Arabesque, Give Every Evidencc Of Artistic Intention. The London Artists Association At A First Glance And In Thc Mass The Paintings Of Mr. Claude Rogers, Who, Together With Mr. John Dodgson, Has An Exhibition At The London Artists Association, 92, New Bond Street, Seem Very Serious, But Rather Bleak. He Has A Preference For Cold, Dark Colours, And In Particular For Those Disquieting Greens And Purples Which Were Popular With The Upholsterers Of Tihe Last Century. And His Designs, Though Thorough, Arc Often Strict And Academic. But All This Is What One Would Expect Of A Serious Iainter At The Beginning Of His Career, And It I. Best To Ignore The Obvious Asperity Of Many O. These Works And To Look For The Signs Of A Frecr Sensibility Woich Will No Doubt Have More Play When The Artist Has Worket Through His Necessary Exerciscs. It Is Clear That Mr. Rogers Has A Delicate Sense Of Colour When He Allows Himsclf To Use It. Thouzh The Prevailing Impression Or His Still Life No. I May Be Sombre. It Cantains Many Deicate Passages. His Self Portrait Seems To Bc An Essay In The Manner Of Cezanne. And Thc Range Of Colour Is Extraordinarily 19! C4Zannes. But It Is A Sound And Original Imitation, Very Solid In Its Modelling, And It Is Clear That Mr. Rogers Has Really Understood The Colours Which He Has Borrowed. His Cssays In The Manner Of Mr. Sickert, Of .,Hich Pechaps The Best Is Chocolates-Cigatettes ! Are By No Ma.,S Superficial. In His Water-Colours, And Cspe2Nily In An Interior Of A Theatre, Mr. Rogers Shows That He Can Draw Agreeably And Elegantly. Mr. Dodgson Is Equally Serious, But There Is A More Obvious Contrast Betwecn His Sensibility And The Organiz.. Ion, The Framework, Which He Finds For It. In A Small Landscape, Le. Salettes, He Has Observed The Scene With Grcat Delicacy, But In Many Of His Larger Piintings He Has Imposed, As If From Without, A Hard And Geometrical Design On The Sensitive Gradation1S Of Colour And The Gentle Modelling Which Scems To Con.C Naturally To Him. At The Cooling Galleries, In The Same Building, Is An Exhibition Of The Work Of Five Artists. Miss Ccelia Bedford Draws With Considerable Accuricy And Includes A Good Deal Of Detail. Btit Cvcrything Is Set Down With So Much Refinement That She Is Often Able To Substitute For The False Emphasis Of Descriptive Drawing A Subdued And Agrieable Rhythm.

Null,Art Exhibition,The Times,1927-Sep-29,"London, England","Art Exhibition. Theodore Roussel. Almost Forgotten Pleasures In Art Are Revived At The Memorial Exhibition Of Works By The Late Ir. Theodore Roussel 1847-1926 At The Goupil Gallery. Mir. Roussel Was The Kind Of Artist That We Call, Tautologically And With More Convenience Than Accuracy, Very Artistic Not So Much In The Sense Of Perfectly Adapting Means To End, W Hich Is Probably The Most Respectable Meaning Of The Word Artistic, But In That Of Cultivating The Means Themselves With Extreme Virtuosity. In This Direction He Went Even Farther Than Wlhistler, With Whom He Was At One Time Closely Associated. Nowadays, Our Attentioi. Is Directed So Exclusively To The Constructive Use Of The Means In Art That Virtuosity Is Not Only A Relief To Our Enjoyment But A Corrective To Our Ideas. We See That, Let Form Be Never So Significant, There Is Something To Be Said For Exquisite Manners. The Immediate Effect Of The Exhibition Of 11 2 Works. Itn Oil, Water-Colour, Etching, And Lithography, Is To Surprise Us At The Range Of The Artist Our Recent Acquaintance With His Worik Beingf Limited To Occasional Prints In The Exhibitions Of The Society Of Graver Printers In Colour, Of Wvhich He Was First President, And One Or Two Small Exhibitions Of His Watercolours. We See Here That Mr. Roussel Was Capable Of Constructing A Large Oil Picture, Such As The Night, September, Chelsea And Perseplione, Though It Will Be Generally Agreed That His More Personal Qualities Are Less Evident In Them Than In Smaller Paintings, In Which The Function Of The Design Might Be Compared To The Rounding Of A Sentence Rather Than To The Building-Up Of A Paragraph. Creen Brocade, Kensington Gardens, A Study Of Horse Chestnuts, With A Sickle-Shaped Curve Of Subdued Simlight Upon The Grass, Is A Good Example. Mr. Roussel Composed A Picture, One Would Say, As A Man Might Compose His Mind, The Better To Dwell Upon His More Intimate Concerns. The Astonishingly Good Preservation Of Portrait Of Mrs. Glray Robinson, A Bust Portrait With The Dark Head Relieved Upon A Pink Ground, Painted About 1886, Or 41 Years Ago, Showvs That His Oil Painting Was As Technically Sound As It Was Artistically Considered. This Portrait, A Sheffield Vase-Grey And Silver, With Appleblossom For Relief, The Lovely Opal, An Evening In June, Apparently On The Thames, And The Tiny A Rose In The Evening, A Single Flower Shining Out Of A Green Gloom Of Shrubs And Clipped Hedges, Are The Oil Paintings Which Suggest The Greatest Enjoyment In Execution. The Temperament Reflected In These Works And In The Water-Colours And Etchings Is Extremely Attractive Fastidious And Taetful, And Enriched With A Refined Sensuiousness. Sedulous As Mir. Roussel Was In. His Meshods, Printing State After State Of His More Elaborate Etchings, His Work Never Looks Laboured. It Is Clear That He Spent As Much Time And Thought Over Leaving Out As Putting In, And His Instinct For Particular Mediurns Was Remarkable. Examples Of. This Are The Water-Colours Sunshine After Shower, A Bathing Subject, And Trees, Water And Clouds, Evening, The Drypoint Head Of A Child, Portrait Of Miss Marion Melville, The Etching Little Girls And Perambulators, Chelsea Embankment, And The Preparatory Study In Aquatint For The Well-Known Lagonie Des Flemus. For His Etchings Mr. Roussel Designed His Own Frames, Printing Upon Them Etched Designs In Sympathy With The Subjects. This Is An Exhibition To Be Taken In A Leisurely Manner-Like A Well-Ordered Meal.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS169680189/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=f63b80f7,,

These He Knows How To Arrange In A Comfortable Manner And With A View To Bringing Out Local Character And Atmosphere, But It Is Not Easy To See Otherwise What He Is After. His Artistic Interest, As Distinct From His Skmll In Representation Would Seem To Be Colour, And In Looking At His Work One Has The Feeling That He Is At Present Allowing It To Be Swamped By What Are For Him Irrelevant Considerations.

H. Wilenski Is Probably Right When He Says, In His Appreciative Introduction To The Catalogue, His Exhibition, To Be Properly Assessed, Must Be Assessed As A Whole, As A Complex Gesture Representing The Aesthetic, Imaginative, And Spiritual Experiences Of A Complex And Adventurous Personality. At Any Rate, The Effect Of The Exhibition Is That Of An Eager, Stimulating, And Suggestive Talker, Who Jumps From One Subject To Another And Does Not Finish His Sentences. It Is An Effect Of Great Versatility, But-Except In The Matter Of Mediums-We Are Not So Sure That It Is Artistic Versatility, And We Should Say That Mr. Underwood Deals In Notions Rather Than In Ideas. His Determination To Keep His Art In Close Touch With His Intuition And Imagination As A Man Is All To The Good, But He Seems To Lack The Patience To Find The Right Form For What He Has To Say, And Too Often He Illustrates The Ideaor The Notion-Instead Of Expressing It In Terms Of His Materials. To Get Over The Worst And Be Done With It, The Cathedral, In The Form Of A Colossal Figure, With Symbols Of The Senses Over The Entrance, Is, Artistically, A Bad Break. Cathedrals Cannot Be Invented, They Grow Out Of A Creed In A Form Determined By The Organization Of Society At A Particular Time, According To The Capacities Of A Particular Method Of Building Construction. By Far The Most Satisfying Of The Works In Sculpture Is Totem To The Artist, A Carving In Yew, Consisting Of Three Figures One Above The Other, The Topmost Standing On Its Head. This Has All The Character Of Something Conceived In And Not Merely Imposed Upon The Material For The Purposes Of Illustration, And It Is Very Rich In Colour. Clod Of Clay Book Of Thel, Blake, In Bronze, Has A Blockly Impressiveness, And There Is Lively Movement In Herald Of New Day, In Chased Brass, But We Cannot Help Feeling That Mr. Underwoods Talents As A Sculptor Find More Characteristic Expression In Such Comparatively Realistic Works As The Torso, Also In Chased Brass, Flux, And The Portrait Head Of Eric Kennington. Except In Totem To The Artist And Watercarrier, In Veined Marble, He Seems To Jump Away From Realism Instead Of Translating It Into Something More Sculptural. Most Of The Paintings Reflect Mr. Underwoods Visit To Mexico, But It Is Questionable If The Most Successful Is Not The Emigrant, A Full Length Of A Seated Woman, With Large Hands In Her Lap, Which Has Both Pathos And Dignity. Cooling Galleries At The Cooling Galleries, 92, New Bond Street, There Is Good Entertainment For Half An Hour In An Exhibition Of 103 Decorative Paintings Of Bird, Flower, And Sporting Subjects, English And Foreign, And Mostly Of The Eighteenth And Nineteenth Centuries. It Is Probable That Some Of The Attributions Are Sanguine, But That Will Not Worry Anybody Who Takes The Exhibition In The Right Spirit-That Is To Say. As An Opportunity To Find Something Which, While Providing Subject Interest, Will Take Its Place As Part Of The Furniture Of A Room. There Are Several Handsome Flower And Other Still-Life Paintings, Such As Flowers And Insects In A Vase, By Nicolas Van Veerendael, And Still Life, By Edward Ladell-Not To Speak Of Several Works By Fantin Latour-And Among The Bird Subjects Poultry In A Landscape And A Happy Family, By C. Van Leemputten, Are Remembered With Special Affection But The Real Entertainment Is In The Collection Of Sporting Subjects By English Artists. In This Field Names Hardly Matter, And The Obscure Artist Will Often Give You A More Racy Representation Of The Scene Or Incident Than A Famous One. There Are Two Lively Little Pictures, A Hawking Party And The Horse Race, Attributed To John Wootton, And The Hunting Party, By D. Wolstenholme, Junior, Holding Up The Coach, By J. C.

Dowdeswell In New Bond-Street, Have Pictures And Drawings Of Some Importance, While At The Rooms Of The Berlin Photographic Conipany, A Fewv Doors Off, There Are On View The First Portions Of The Splendid Wvork Which They Are Devoting To The Hermitage Gallery At St. Petersburg. No Fewer Than 84 Of The Finest Pictures In That Gallery, The Least Known Of All The Great National Collections Of Hurope, Are Being Reproduced In Photogravure, And Are Ultimately To Be Accompanied By A Description By Dr. Tschudi, Of Berlin, An Interesting Preface Being Contributed By Sir Martin Conway. Among The Pictures As Yet Reproduced Are Three Great Titians-The Danae, The Magdalen, And The Toilet Of Venus -Several Rembrandts, Three 3Murillos Of The Highest Quality, The Exquisite Madonna Attributed To Leonardo, And Some Choice Dutch Genre Pictures. For Those Who Prefer Originals To Photographs, However Fine, There Are Some Good Things At Messrs. Dowdeswells, And Notably One Of The Most Periect Works Of Jacob Ruysdael That Exist Anywhere. This Is The Upright Landscape No. 243 In Smiths Catalogue Which Belonged To Baron Verstolk, And, Unlike Most Of His Collections, It Has Remained In The Low Countries Till Recently. The Foreground Has Darkened A Little, But In Subject And In Handling This Admirable Scene Of Woodland And Sun-Lit Cottages Must Fairly Be Called A Masterpiece. Two Portraits By The Rare Pupil Of Hals, Jan Verspronck, Show The School Of Haarlem At Its Great Moment, And Some Conversation Pieces By Dirk Hals, Simon Kick, And Others Are. Of Interest. There Are Also Some Good Early Portraits There Are English Works Of Some Importance, Including A Fine New Of Lincoln By De Wint And One Of The Best Of The Haskett-Smith Morlands-A Work Of Exceptional Quality. At The Fine Art Eocietys, Besides The Burnejones Sketches Which Have Been Having A Prodigious Success There Are A Few Pauels Of Oil And Water-Colour Sketches By Suchwell.Known Artists As Messrs. Boilghton, Wimperis, And Orrock, Mime. Renriette Ronuer, Mr. Elgood, And Mr. Thorburn, The Painter Of Game Birds. More Novel, At Least To English People, Are The Brilliant Society Sketches Of The American Artist, Charles Dana Gibson, The Most Celebrated Of All The Pictorial Satirists Of New York.

All Three Of The Present Exhibitors At The Redfern Gallery, 27, Old Bond-Street, Have Something To Commend Them. In The Case Of Mr. Adrian Allinson, Who Shows Mostly Landscapes In Oil, Watercolour, Black And White, And Coloured Chalks, It Is - Detachment. He Happens To Have- Painted Several Of His Pictures In Provence, But, With An Intelligent Applicatiorn Of The Principles Of C6Zanne To His Own Purposes, He Has Avoided That Effect Of Fawmng Upon The Subject-Matter Which Is Beginning To Make Provence As Unwelcome In Our Exliibitions As Cornwaau Used To Be And Sussex Now Is In Our Novels. Mr. Allinsons Talent Is Explorative, And You Would Say That He Walked About With A Cool Head, Perhaps Whistling, In Order To See How The Landscape Would Go In His Pictures. His General Aim Is To Bring Three Dimensions Fnto A Decorative Arrangement, And He Does It Mainly By Observing Directions And Relations-The Mnlination Of Walls And Furrows And The Relative Positions Of Trees On Plan. Provencal Apple Orchard And The Plane Trees Of Avignon Are Two Very Good Compositions On This Basis. Proven9Al Spring, In Oil, Is Perhaps A Little Over-Calculated, But Venetian Fugue, In The Same Medium, Justifies Its Title By The Contrapuntal Interest Derived From Curved Bridge And Straight Houses. Mr. Allinsos Work May Lack Magic, But It Is Eminently Reasonable In Form And Plesi In Colour. The Obvious Affinity Between Mr. Tom Nash And Mlr. Stanley Spencer Is Interesting Rather Than Derogatory To The Former, Because It Seems To Show That, Given A Keen Interest In The Subjectmatter Of Scriptural Themes And, At The Same Time, A Talent For Formal Design, Things Work Out Pretty Much Alike. We Are Inclined To Think, Too, That-Possibly Because He Is Attempting Less Complicated Problems-Mr. Nesh Has More Command Of His Material Than Mlr. Spencer, At- Any Rate When He Is Wvorking On A Small Scale, And His Colour Is Certainly Better Regulated. We Are Too Familiar With Purely Illustrative Painting And Also With The Painting That Runs Away From Illustration In A Sort Of Panic, So That It Is Rather A Relief To Come Upon An Artist Like A-R. Nash, Who Does Not, In The Classic Phrase, Empty Out The Baby With The Bath. His Largest Painting, The Cruciflbion, Though Intense In Feeling, Is Not Very Well Organized, But Healing The Sick, The Fall Of Jericho, Christ Anid The Mroney Chlangers, And The Small Crucifixion Are Excellent Pictures, Interesting To The Eye And At The Same Time Interesting In Their Subjects. Mr. Nash Is To Be Encouraged In The Double Task That He Is Attempting-To Organize Both His Religious And His Pictorial Interests. The Third Exhibitor, Mr. George Butler, Has Slighter Aims-Indeed, He Might Be Said To He Engaged In Slight Plasics, His Evident Desire Being To Suggest Full Relief With Colour Only. Apples, Mauve Tulips, Form In Colour, And Stiu Life Are All Charming Exercises On These Lines, Sensitive In Feeling And Decorative In Arrangement.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS101916295/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=cf3bc9a0,,

Buxton-Knight, To Be Supplemented Some Weeks Hence By A Display Of The Same Artists Watercolours At The Leicester Galleries. Mr. Buxton-Knight? Who Died Last January At The Age Of 66, After A Long Period Of Ill-Health, Was A Very Sincere And Genuine Painter, And One Of The Few Landscape Artists Of The Day Who Had Any Claim To Bo Called A Colourist. Richness Rather Than Subtlety Was The Characteristic Of His Pictures And While He Never Impressed The Royal Academy Sufficiently To Obtain Th Associateship, He Appealed To Lovers Of Advanced Art As One Of Th Ablest Of Our Landscape Painters. He Obtained His Effects By Massing His Colours And To A Certain Extent By Loading His Paint. He Loved To Render The English Sky With Masses Of Cloud At Rest Or In Slow Motion He Loved Also Heavy Trees, Beginning To Grow Golden Under The Touch Of Autumn And Now And Then, With Much Understanding Of Th Fora And Movement Of Waves, He Painted The Seo. Examples Are To Be Found In This Gallery. Abundant A Fine Sea Piece, Painted In 1893, Gives Us White Walkr Near Dover Another, Smaller In Az And Less Stormy In Subject, Shows Shecmess Harbour, With Boats Moving In And Out. Others Take Us To Richly Wooded Inland Landscapes, Such As The White Lodge, Richmond, Richmond From Below Th Star And Garter, And Th Very Recent Thorn Tree In Flower. A Pathetic Interest Attaches To The Very Beautiful English Cottage Homes 38, For, When Paralysis Had Disabled The Painters Right Hand, He Painted This Entirely With His Left. This Exhibition Will Bring Home To Many Minds The Fact That In Buxton-Knight We Have Lost An Artist Of Distinguished Merit, Who Was Not Properly Appreciated While He Was Alive. At The Leicester Galleries, The Place Lately Held By The Late H. G. Moon And Mr. Rackham Is Being Filled By Two Very Well Known Artists In Water-Colour, Mr. Herbert Marshall And Mr. James Aumonier. The Former, Whose Views Of Misty London Have Been A Feature Of The Old Water-Colour Society For A Generation, Has Left The Mists Behind Him In Three Or Four Visits To France-, The Result Of Which Is Here In 68 Drawings Of Cathedral Cities. The Tours Have Reached From Abbeville To Poitiers, From Bourges To Laon And, Though The Cathedrals Are A Feature Of Mast Of The Drawings, Mr. Marshall Has Often Devoted Himself To Some Old Historic Castle, Or To Some Medieval Street. For Instance, Amboise And Its Matchless Chateau, Rising Straight From The River Bank, Gives Him Scope For Some Of His Finest Drawings, And So Does The Seldom Visited Sxumnr. But We Have Tho Cathedrals Of Amiens, Rouen, Evreux, Chartres, Meaux, And A Score Of Other Places, All Exquisitely Drawn, And Glowing With Sunny Colour. There Is No Cure For Incipient Mannerism Like A Change Of Venue. France Has Quite Shaken Off Th Slight Monotony Of Habit Which Was Threatening To Injure This Excellent Artists Work.Mr. Aumorder More Often Appears Before The Public As A Painter In Oils, But His Water-Colours Ar Most Charming And Accomplished, As These Rooms Will Show. His Trees Are A Little Faulty, And Are Sometimes Generalized Rather Carelessly Seo No. 12, But In Tho Rendering Of English Pastoral Landscape, As In Th Sheep-Washing, The Rough Pasturage, And The Afternoon Sunshine 60, There Are Few Painters Who Can Surpass Him. These Drawings Imply On The Part Of The Artist Years Of Patient Observation And A Life Steeped In Tho Associations Of The Country. Very Different, But Quite As Remarkable, Are The Drawings Of Tho Boman Campagna By Signor A. Sartorio At The Fine Art Societys In New Bond-Street. The Painter Is Well Known In Italy And In Germany He Has Worked For The King, And Has Been Professor At Weimar And He Admits The Influence Of Men So Different As Gerome And D. G. Rossetti. What His Large, Ambitious Pictures May Be Like We Cannot Say, But These Small Water-Colours And Pastels Are Of Great Interest To All Who Love Italy And To All Who Admire A Hand That Draws Nature As The Eye Sees It. We Are Told That It Is To Signor Carlandis Recommendation That This Exhibition Is Duo But Certainly There Could Not Be Two Painters More Dissimilar. For Our Part W Infinitely Prefer These Accurate Transcripts By Ths Younger Man To Th Conventionalities Of The Elder. In Another Gallery In Bond-Street, Messrs. Connells, There Is On View A Large Collection Of M. Boots Etchings Of Paris. They Are Mdryonesque, Without Being Imitated From Meryon. M. Bjot Is An Admirable Draughtsman, And His Buildings And Bridges Have Substance And Solidity.

Though Different In Subject, It Reminds One Rather Of Some Of The Newlyn And Penzance Views Of Mr. Stanlhope Forbes. There Is The Same Lack Of Emphasis, Almost As If-Though The Treatment Is Not Uhghgrahru A Gotograph Had Been Takenas Aguide. Oud Over Helvellyn Is The Most Consistent Landscape In Oil By-The Artist That One Can Remember, Chiefly On Account Of The Better Relation Between Clouds And Mountains, Obtained By Getting More Architecture Into The Former And Departing From A Linear Character In The Latrter. With Its Downipour Of Light, Revealing A Hollow In The Hills, And One Emp Atic - Peak, It Is A Very Uplifting Canvas.

In View Of It, The Rea,Tion Of Our Younger Painters In The Direction Of The Solid Constrtction Indicated Here By The Brown Young Philosopher Of Mr. Gerald Ososky Is Understandable.

If They Are Not It Is Onlv Because The Average Of Quality Showvn Here Is Lowered In Practice By The Taste Of A Majotity Of Patroni For What Malr. Thorp Aptly Calls The Technique Of Sentimental Realism. The Notion That This Technique Represents A Proved Efficacy With The Public Mav Be Dismissed. Tihe Average Quality Of This Exhibition Is All The More Remarkable Wlhen It Is Noted That Two Of Our Best And Most Active Poster Designers, Mr. Gregory 1Brown And Mr.-Horace Taylor, Are Not Representecl. A Word Is Due To The Excellent Arrangement Of The Exhibition, The Posters Being Displayed On A Background Of Grey Paper, With Black Borders And Divisions To Set Them Off. We Have Seldom Seen The Size Of The Royal Institute Galleries So Completely Justified By Their Contents. Most Of The Posters, Which Are Hung In Groups According To Artist, Arc Familiar, So That Only General Observations Are Needed Here. Having Regard To Psychological Differences In The Puiblic It Would Be Rash To Say What, Excluding Sentimental Realism, Is The Most Effective Poster Style, But There Is An Interesting Comparison To Be Made Between Two Groups At One End Of The Large Gallery Those By Mr. Tom Pcirvis And Mr. E. Mcknight Kauffer. On Their Owvn Lines Both Are Consistently Good, Mr. Puiviss L.N.E.R. East Coast Poster, Of A Child Wading Out With Water-Wings, Being As Good As The Style Of Simplified Realism Permits. We Cannot Help Feeling, Hox-Ever, That Mr. Kauffers Posters Have The Advantage In Concentration Of Design, And The Artistic Lesson We Would Deduce From Tbe Comparison-A Lesson That The Heraldic Artists Of The Past Followed By Instinct-Is That Simplification Without Distortion, Using The Word In A Broad Sense To Include All Modifications Of Outline, Always Results In A Certain Emptiness Of Effect. In Proportion As You Leave Out You Have To Modify Or Reinforce The Remainder. A Good Many Of The Posters In The Exhibition Suffer Somewhat From The Effect Of Emptiness, Of Something Left Out, That We Observe In Those By Mr. Purvis, And We Would Urge A Study Of Mr. Kauffers To See How The Effect Can Be Overcome. Mr. Kauffers Modernity Has Not Much To Do With The Matter. The Accent, Or Idiom, May Be New, But The Principle Is Not. As Anybody May See Who Studies A Good Sign-Board Or The Royal Standard. For An Effect Of Completeness, Simplification Implies A Decorative Convention.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS236134123/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=e468e99e,,

The Immense Collection Formed By The Late Mr. Stoats Fortes Is Being Gradually Dispersed But Toe Process Is Of Necessity Slow.

Then Came The Exhibition At The Grafton Galleries And Latterly Messrs. Brown And Phillips Have Been Shewing Different Sectionswater-Colours By Harpignies, Chalk Drawings By Millet, And Now Some50 Pictures, Chiefly By Corot, The Exhibition Of These Opens This Morning At The Leicester Galleries. The Pictures Are For The Most Part Either Early Works Or Slight Productions, Some Of Which Were Probably First Thoughts For Larger Canvases. As Such They Are Interesting, Though There Is Not A Picture Here That Could Ire Called A First-Rate Or Representative Corot. The Auvergne 18 Was Painted So Far Back As 1833, In The Precise And Careful Manner Practised By Corot While Under The Influence Of His Master Michahon But Most Of The Others Are Of The Later Period, In The Masters Characteristic Manner.

Three Fine Works By Harpignies, Painted In 1896,1897, And 1902, Show That Excellent Master Of Landscape In His Later Phase, When He Seems To Have Set Himself Deliberately To Carry On The Barbizon Tradition. There Is A Good Interior By Albert Neuhuys, Whose Art, Now So Much In Favour, Seems To Have Passed Through Precisely The Same Stages As That Of Josef Israels, The Chief Of The School Of Other Foreign Painters We Notice A Charming Gazin And A Small Work By An Italian, F. Scattola, Who Paints In A Manner Not Unlike That Of The Eminent Frenchman. Mr. Oxchardson Has An Important Single Figure, Jessica, Which Does Not Seem To Have Been Exhibited Before There Is A Pleasant Example Of The Delicate Art Of Mr. Stott 36, And One Of Mr. J. W. Godwards Classical Figures, Drawn And Painted With The Accuracy Of A Leighton, But Too Artificial For The Realistic Spirit, Of To-Day. Among Other Small Exhibitions Now Open Or Just Opening We May Mention The Drawings By Mr. Sutton Palmer At The Leicester Galleries, Messrs. Connells Show Of The Fine Landscapes Of The Late Alexander Fraser At Their Rooms In Old Bond-Street, And The Small Collection Of New Pictures By Mr. Bysin Shaw At The Dowdssweu Galleries. Mr. Shaw Is A Serious Aspirant For Fame, And In Some Respects He Is Undoubtedly An Artist To He Taken Note Of. He Draws Well, Is Not Afraid Of Brilliant Colour, Aud Paints Textures With Curious Felicity. But Bis Symbolism Is Too Elaborate To Be Always Happyas, For Instance, In The Central Picture Here, Which Comes Perilously Near To The Grotesque And He Is Far Too Fond Of Great Gold Frames Wherein The Gilder Outdoes Himself And Almost Kins The Picture.

In The Summer Exhibition Of Modem Art-Consisting Of 85 Paintings And Drawings And Twvo Pieces Pf Sculpture-At The Goupil Gallery There Are Several Things Of Uncommon-Interest. Modern, By The Way, Is To Be Understood In A Liberal Spirit, Since Fantin-Latour, Ribot, And, Charles Conder Are Among The Artists Represented And The General Tone Is Rather Before That Of The Moment. First Place Among The Uncommonly- Interesting Things Mist Be Given To The Extremely Beautiful Watercolour Of The Farm Pond, By Mr. John Nash. Without Being Obviously Designed . It Is Full Of Subtle Rhythmns Obtained Without Violence To The Facts, And We Do Not Reriiember A Recent Water-Colour Either Carried So Far Without Loss Of The First Impulse Or So Successful In Combining Natural Poetry With Pictorial Music. Then There Are Some Drawings Of Architecture By Mr. Eric Gill. Except One Wood Engraving, We Do Not Remember Any Work By Him Of Such Subjects-For Which He Is Obviously Suited By Temperament. Technically These Drawings Are Superb. Firm And At The Same Time Nervous And They Are All The Better For Subordinating The Design On The Paper To The Design Of The Architecture Itself.-Uite A Different Considerition. There Are Many. Other Good Water-Colour And Other Drawings Martindale And High Street, By Sir Charles Holmes, The Ferry, By Mr. Walter W. Russell, Tie Adam And Eve, Old Chelsea, By Messrs. H. And- W. Greaves, And Nude Study, By Mr. Augustus John, For Examples But They Are More Familiar In Kind Than Those Noted Above. Technical Accomplishment Rather Than Originality In Design Is The Note Among The Oil Paintings. A Place Of Honour Is Given To A Very Good Portrait Of Iris, By Mr. Villiam Nicholson, A Work Which Combines To A Remarkable Degree Full Representation With Plastic Feeling. This Is The Kind Of Painting-That-Makes One Ask Whether All The Sacrifices In The Interests Of Design .Vhich Are Now Common Are Really Necessary. The Same Question Is Excited By The Grey Painting Of The Cooks, By Th. Ribot. On The Other Hand Rest Camp, St. Valery-Sur-Somnire, By Sir William Orpen, Accomplished As It Is, Does Make You Feel That More Would Have Been Said With A Muore Suminary Treatment. There Is A Good Group Of Three Works By Air. Bernard Meninsky, Energetic In Design And Sharp In Colour, And Mr. Mark-Gertler Has Seldom Shown To Better Advantage Than In His Painting Of The Nude, Meditation. It Is Felt To Be On Exactly The Right Scale For Him, And It Is Very Choice In Colour. The Stove, By Mr. Sickert, Tannhiuser, By Fantin-Latour, Seapiece, By Sidney Starr, Brother And Sister, By Mr. Neville Lewis, And Hertfordshire Lane, By Mr. Gilbert Spencer, Are Other Specially Attractive Works In An Exhibition Which-And It Is Intended As A Compliment-Is To Be Enjoyed Rather Than Written About.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS235347686/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=0c658dcb,,

If Mr. Strasser Has Drawn And Painted Bali Dancers And Tibetan Lamas, It Was Because The Shapes And Colours Of Them Were More To His Taste Than The Shapes And Colours Of Europeans, And One Pleasing Result Is That Their Human Characters Come Through In A Very Friendly Manner. The Merits Of The Cock Fight, At Bali, Were Commented On When It Was Shown At The Legation, And The Picture Makes An Even Better Impression Here As A Gorgeous Piece Of Designing In Colour. The Chief Interest Of The Exhibition, However, Is In The Tempera Paintings And Drawings Of Native Types. Mir. Strasser Began As A Sculptor, Working Under His Father, And The Sculptors Instinct Is Evident Not So Much In The General Forms As In The Surface Modelling, The Ripple Of Light Over Dark, Polished Skins. The Drawing Is Bold And Free, Suggesting Always An Interest In Tone Rather Than In Line, And Every Advantage Is Taken Of Decorative Opportunities In The Costumes. A Bali Dancer, A Chinese Wood Chopper, A Young Chinese Girl, And A Chinaman Holding A Pipe May Be Named For Special Qualities. But It Is The Effect Of Excited Interest In The Artist Which Makes The Exhibition Remarkable. An Italian Artist. Signor Edoardo Gioja, Who Is Exhibiting Landscapes, Drawings, Portraits And Decorations At 58, Glebe-Place, Chelsea, Is More Akin To The Great Figures Of The I Italian Renaissance Than To Most Artists Of To-Day. A Designer Before Everything, He Is Painter, Carver, Modeller And Worker In Metal And Textiles. In Rome He Has Carried Out Several Important Schemes Of Decoration-Notably At The Palazzo Rava, Now Used As The Czechoslovak Legation-Being Responsible For Both Painting And Reliefs, And An Example Of His Decorative Work Is To Be Seen In London, At The Caf6 Monico, In The Shape Of A Frieze Representing A Vintage Of The Golden Age. Signor Gioja Is Represented In The National Gallery, Rome, And Other Public Galleries By Portraits, And He Has Painted Several Distinguished People In This Country, Including The Late Baron Von Hiugel And The Late Mr. M. D. Jeejeebhoy-The Lst Being Exhibited In The Academy Of 1923. The Greater Part Of His Present Exhibition Consists Of Pastel Studies Of The Roman Campagna And Of Places On The Coast Of Italy And Brittany. Essentially Classical In Feeling, Broad In Style And Delicate In Colour, They May For Convenience Be Compared To The Work Of Giovanni Costa, Whose Influence Was Reflected In The Landscape Work Of Both Lord Leighton And Sir W. B. Richmond. Passing Clouds, Near Tivoli, La Vicomte, Dinard, And Monte Cave, Near Rocca Di Papa, May Be Named As Particularly Good Examples. The Foreshortened Head Of Baby Sleeping And Some Preliminary Studies For Decorations. Bespeak Signor Giojas Power As A Figure Draughtsman There Are Some Delightful Nature Studies Illustrating A Childrens Book, A Voi Bimbi, Wtitten By The Artist And His Versatility Is Further Shown In Some Impressed And Gilded Designs Upon Velvet, In The Venetian 16Th Century Tradition. The Exhibition Is Open Daily From 12 To 6.30 Until May 9. The Faculty Of Being Moved By The Beauty Of A Landscape Or Of A Flower Is Fortunately Not Possessed Only By Artists. Mr. And Mrs. Clhrisue Record In Their Pictures At 22, Old Bond-Street The Fact That They Were Moved By Landseapes And Flow-Ers, Ad They Sometimes Record This Quite Competently Enough For Us To Remember By Their Pictures The Emotion, Partly Unaestletic, Which We Should Feel In Contemplatiiig The Subjects Of These Pictures. But They Are Often Too Much Artists To Abandon Themselves Entirely To Addressing The Uniesthetic Emotions, And Too Little Artists To Raise The Purely Testhetic Emotion Which Might Be Roused By A Painting Of An Old Pair Of Boots, Equally As Wvell As By A Painting Of Flowers. Their Paintings Are Obviously Sincere, And The Sincere Expression Of An Emotion, Even Though It Is Mainly Unesthetic, Is Not To Be Despised. But The Conventions Of Their Fellowartists Conceal The Natural Simplicity Of Their Emotions. It Is Only In A Few Of Their Pictures, Such As No. 57, After The Shower, By Mr. Christie, Tiat These Conventions Are Sufficiently Mastered, And Therefore Hidden, And We Can Consider Only The Subject Of The Picture, Which The Painter Obviously Found Delightful, And Succeeds In Making Us See That It Was So.

The Great Eighteenth- And Nineteenth-Century Water-Colourists Are Well Represented, And Among Modern Artists There Are Excellent Examples Of The Work Of Wilson Steer And Glyn Philpot. The Reichenbach Picture, An Impressive Blend Of Blues, Greens, Browns, And Greys, Which Is Particularly Notable For The Way In Which Turner Has Caught The Play Of Sunlight On The Mist Rising Out Of A Rocky Cauldron, Would Be Outstanding In Any Company But It Has Distinguished Competitors In Peter De Wints Carisbrooke Castle, Thomas Girtins Serene Impression Of A Rainbow Over The River Exe,And Cotmans Sepia Drawing Of Ilarmoltville Church. Other Swiss Sttidies By Turner Include One Of Thc Lurleiberg And Another Of The Wettcrhorn Fromn Rosenlaui, A Thing Of The Most Perfect Delicacy, With A Blue On The Distant Mountain Which Only One Hand Could Have Given It. In The Room Devoted To Modern Artists, Where Again The Work Is Of A High Standard, Mr. Wilson Steer Is Represented By Montreuil-Sur-Mer Dated 1907-In Which He Admirably Catches The Atmosphere Of The Deserted Square Of A French Provincial Town On A Cloudy Day-And By Greenhithe In Summer, A Slight But Charming Sketch Done In 1932. Next In Interest Come Some Firstrate Figure Drawings By Mr. Glyn Philpot, Notably The Graceful Seated Nude No. 95 Done In Red Crayon, While There Are Excellent Portraits Of A Young Negro And Of A Boy Asleep By The Same Artist. Lord Methuen Also Shows An Interesting And Distinctive Study In The Nude No. 98. Hazy Weather, Cromer, Is The Best Of Sir Muirhead Bones Exhibits, Some Of Which Are A Little Disappointing. Mr. Bertram Nicholls Makes Effective Play With Sunlight And Shadow On White And Grey Stone Buildings, And Mr. Anthony Devas Shows Three Pencil Drawings Which Are All Clever Studies Of Mood. - The New Forest, By John Nash, Is A Daring Mixture Of Colour Justified By The Resuit, And, In Their Different Ways And With Varying Surccess, There Are Other Interesting Things From Paul Nash, Ethelbert White, And Claude Rogers.

Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1911-Jan-10,"London, England","Art Exhibitions, 1 1 A Large Number Of Exhibitions Have Been Opening Their Doors During The Lastsew Days So Many, Indeed. As To Bewilder The Intending Visitor. Unfortunately - - It Cannot Be Said That They Contain Anything Of Groat Interest, If We Are To Except The Short Of The Senefelder Club, Which Teell And Fully Represents The State Of Artistic Lithography At The Presort Day. The Rest, Whether They Are Miscellaneous Or One Man Shows, Are Evidence Rattier Of The Quantity Of Modern Art Production Than Of Its Quality, And For The Wmfain Xsoplr Which It Few Vears Asrst The Most Part Contain Work Which A Few Years Ago Would Have Been Kept For Home Use By The Artists. And Not Put Before The Public. This Is Especially The Case With The Immense Collection Of 563 Works Exhibited By The Sketch Society At The Galleries Of The Royal Institute. The Title Is Not Well Chosen, For At Least Half The, Exhibits Are Not Sketches At All, Bub Small Finished Drawings And Paintings, Not Good Enough For The Normal Exhibitions Held In These Rooms In The Summer And Autumn. In The West Gallery We Rather Liked Mr. E. L. Pattisons The Bridge, Four Small Portraits By Mr. Arthur Garratt, Two Portrait Studies By Mr. Hugh Bunbury, A Group Of Small Landscapes By Mr. Claude Hayes, And A Dutch Interior By Mr. El J. Pearson. The Large South Gallery Shows A Larger Proportion Of Good Work. Mr. J. W. Schofield Has A Talent For Painting Moonlight Mr. Edgar Downs Can Block Out The Forms Of Animals With A Certain Vigorous Truth And Landscape And Other Sketches By Mr. Montague Smyth, Mr. Frank Carter, Mr. Max Ludby, And Mr, Terrick Williams Maintain The - Respectable Level Winch These Artists Reached Long Ago. Doubtless The Same Might Be Said Of A Good Many Others But We Remain In Doubt As To Whether The Sketch Society Has Justified- Its Separate Existence. This Club, Formed To Celebrate The Centenary Of The Invention Of Lithography By Aloys Senefelder, Is Holding Its Second Exhibition At The Goupil Gallery. It Is Strengthened By The Inclusion Of A Few Works By Manet, Renoir, F. Bops, Fantin, And Other Old Masters, But The Great Majority Of The Lithographs Are New Works By The Members Of What Seems To Be A Flourishing Society. The Men Mentioned Above Only Used Lithography Occasionally They Were Exceptions, -Who Saw The Possibilities Of The Art In A Day When It Had Become Discredited. Whistler And Fantin-Latour Were The Men Who Really Revived It And. Now All The Young Artists, And Many Of Their Elders, Are Fond Of Practising It. The Method Presents No Difficulties To Any One Who Can Draw, And Ib Certainly Reproduces Penal Work, Or Chalk Drawings, Far More Accurately Than Any Other Form Of Engraving. It Is, In Fact, As The Preface To The Cata. Logue Says, Autographic, A Lithograph By Whistler, Or By M. Steinlen, Or Such A One As Mr. Albert Sterners Charming Portrait Of A Lady, Is Practically The Same Thing As The Original Drawingso That It Is No Wonder That The Art Has Quickly Become A Favourite Both With The Artists And With The Public. Among The Most Successful Of The Exhibitors We May Mention Mr. C. H. Shannon, Mr. John Copley, Mr. E. A- Hope Who Sends Three Very Vigorous Compositions, Mr. Sterner, And Miss Mary Creighton To Whom May Be Added Such - Well-Known Foreign Artists Hans Thoma, Dfeirs Lucas, Smile- Claus, And C. Lsandre. Sir H. Von Herkomer, Who Has Presented The Club With The Death-Mask Of Senefelderhe Worked, Be It Remembered, In Bavaria, Though Born At Pragueis An Active Member Of The Society, And Sends Some Remarkable Contributions. The Manets, Which Include The Terribly Impressive Guerre Civile And The Rare Colour-Print Called Polichinelle, Are A Very Striking Feature Of The Collection. A Landscape Exhibition. It Is Creditable To The Small Group Of Painters Who Started Their Little January Landscape Exhibition In 1896 That It Has Gone On Without A Break Till Now. The 16Th Exhibition Is Open At The Royal Watercolour Societys Room In Pall-Mall East, And There Messrs. R. W. Allan, J. Aumonier, Austen Brown, J. S. Hill, And Leslie Thomson, With Three Invited Colleagues, Have Prepared A Show Of 68 New Landscapes. The Guests This Year Are Messrs. Moffat Lindner, Coutts Michie, And James Paterson, Two Of Whom Strengthen The Scottish Element In The Show Already Predominant. There Is Nothing To Say About A Display Of This Kind Except That In Its General Level Of Sound Workmanship It Repeats The Achievements Of Former Years. Mr. Austen Brown And Mr. Hill Have Sometimes Been More Successful In Landscape, But Mr. Allans Large Sea-Piece, Sir. Leslie Thomsons Holyhead Mountain, And Mr. Aumoniers Golden Autumn Vision Of Dnlas Valley Are As Good As Anything Ever Done By Them. Mr. Hills Two Little Flower-Pieces Are Exquisite. The Upper Rooms Of The Goupil Gallery Contain A Large Collection Of The Paintings Of The Late Miss Sarah Dodson Transferred From Brighton, Where They Were Shown In The Autumn. This Lady Was An American Artist, Who Worked Chiefly In Paris, Under Luminais And Jules Lefebvre Sho Died Five Years Ago, At The Age Of Ss. Her Work Shows Various Influences, For She Was An Eclectic, Following Now The Tradition Of Couture As In The Fine Picture Of Deborat?, Now That Of The Costume Painters Of The Day, And Now That Of The French Landscapists, Though In Landscape She Was Herself A Careful Student Of Nature. It Seems That The Pictures Are Presently To Be Exhibited In America, Where, Doubtless, Many Of Them Will Find A Home In The Public Galleries. The Other Exhibitions Which Open To-Day Are At The Leicester Galleries, The Fine Art Societys, The Baillie Gallery, And The Carfax Gallery. At The First-Named We Have A Large Collection Of English Water-Colours, Formed Some Years Ago By A Collector Who Died Recentiv These, Though None Is Quite First Rate, Are Interesting Examples Of Our Water-Colour Art From About 1840 To 1890. The Haddon Hall Drawings By David Cox, The Landscapes By Bennett, Mckewan, And Thomas Collier, And A Powerful Study By Cecil Lawson, Are Among The Most Noteworthy. In The Adjoining Room Are A Number Of Water-Colour Landscapes By Mr. Robert Tattle, R.W.S., A Scottish Artist Of Talent. The Fine Art Society Shows Some Extremely Pretty Garden Scenes And Flowery Mountain Landscapes By Miss Rosa Wallis, Not Very Original, But Sure To Be Popular A Large Collection Of Drawings By Mr. Egerton Hine, The Best Of Them Recalling The Down Landscapes Of His Father, Once Vice-President Of The Institute And The Pictures By Mr. Arthur Garratt, From Which The Latest Of The Innumerable Books About Eton Has Been Illustrated. Mr. Garratt Paints Well, Especially Wtien He Has To Deal With Interiors, Such As Upper School And The Hall.At The Baillie Gallery, In Bruton-Street, Are Some Good Oil Pictures, Landscapes, And Portraits, By Mr. W. J. Leech, An Artist Of Much Promise, And Some Agreeable Water-Colour Sketches, Very Slight And Transparent, By Mr. William A. Wildman.Lastly, The Carfax Gallery, In Burystreet, Contains The Recent Drawings Of Mr. Walter Sickert, A Faithful Follower Of Whistler And At The Present Time As Would Appear From A Recent Paper A Votary Of The Post-Impressionists. These Extremely Slight Performances Are Very Clever, But They Take Us Only A Very Little Way. Perhaps This Is As Well, For The Way Is Often Not The Way Of Pleasantness, Except For Those Who Find Their Ideal Of Life In The Music-Hall And Their Ideal Of Form In Beings Like That Called La Belle Hollandaise.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS185793578/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=68cf6286,,

That Mr. Ivon Hitehens Is Not Limited To What The Shops Would Call Pastel Shades In His Colouring Is Shown By His Management Of Deeper Tones In The Exceueent Landscape Called The !Iluer8 Cottage, But Most Of His Oil Paintings At The Mayor Gallery, 37, Sackville-Street, Would, So To Speak, Melt In The Mouth. His Enjoyment Of Pink, Blue, And Pale Grey Is Evident In His Care To Give Them The Mamraum Of Gradation, By Choosing Rounded Forms Like Stuffed Armchairs And Puffy Eiderdown Quilts, Or By Quite Femorselessly Curving That Which A Literal Petou Would Call Straight. The Most Engaging Quality In His Work Is, Indeed, The Combination Of A Perfectly Friendly Feeling Towards Nature With A Cheerful Determination To Bend Her To His Own Uses, Which Are To Make Confections Of Shapes And Colours In The Medium Of Oil Paint. It Is Put That Way Because One Of The Nost Promising Signs In His Work Is A Feeling For The Mnaterial. Something He Owes To Matisse And Something, One Would Say, To Marie Laurencin, But He Is Young Enough To Wear These Influences Gracefully, And He Is Clearly Finding His Own. Way. So Long As He Keeps On Touching Earth His Light-Handed Way With The Facts Is No More To Be Regretted Than Is The Turning Of Blackberries Into Blackberry Jelly. That Nature Does Not Protest Under The Process Is Shown By The Amount Of Homely Feeling Which Survives In The Millers Cottage.

At The Macrae Gallery, 16, Fulham-Road, Is To Translate What He Sees Into Terms Of Pure Colour, Which He Does By The Careful Relation Of Tones In A Curious Technique Of Square Touches. Every Now And Then He Produces Something Quite Thrilling, Such As The Purple And Gold Orange Terraces, The Brown And, Purple Village Of St. Jeannet, And Some Of The Studies Of Almond Blossom But His Method Does Not Seem To Be Suitable For Al Purposes. .His Architectural Subjects Are Apt To Look Papery Through Some Defect Of Relation Between The Lighted And Shadowed Planes. But For This The Blighty Tower Swims In The Light Well Deserves Its Title You Say Swims, Yes Mighty, No. In Painting Tigers And Leopards Mr. Yarrow Jones Is Preoccupied With The Stripes And Spots, But It Is Remarkable What An Effect Of Solidity He Has Given To The Foreshortened Beast In Tigers. At The Same Galery There Are Water-Colour Impressions Of Australia By Miss Edith Vaizeyhope. These, Grouped According To State, Are Of Hardly More Than Illustrative Interest, Though One Or Two.

In View Of The Generous Hospitalit.Y Given To British Arts Aid Iaiiufactuires At The Forthcoming Exhibition At Buenos Aires, The National Gallery Of British Art Was Obviously The Riglht Place For Such An Introduction To Native Life-Particularly Since Senior Quir6S Lhas No Material Interest In The Nmatter, His Pictures Being Destined For A Corpuration In The United States After They Have Betjn Exhibited By Invitation In The Luxembourg Museum, Paris. This Is Not To Say That Senior Quir6S Wonld Not Be Welcome Here On Artistic Grounds It Is Only To Mark The Essential Purpose Of His Art In This Particular Series Ot Paintings-25 In All. Tlhere Is Sufficient Evidence In The Few Landscapes Included Thlat Hie Has Sometlhing Of His Own To Tell Tls Ill Ai Pulely Pictorial Direction, Sometiung That Is Gravely Poetical In Feeling. But The Broad Fact Remains That In These Lays Of Rapid International Comnmuuicaiion, Unless A Foreign Artist Lias Some Strilng Aesthetic Message To Convey, Which Would Hardly Be Claimed For Sefior Quir6S, Lie Is Paying Us A Higher Complirnent By Present Ing Us With His Country Than Witli His Artistic Opinions And, Particularly In The Case Of Comparatively New Countries With Strongly Marked Characteristics, We Could Do Wvith More Exhibitions Of This Kind. The Impression Given By The Paintings Of Sefior Quir6S Is That These Descendants Of Thle Conquistadores Bear Somewhat The Same Relation To Their European Ancestors As The Boers Of South Africa To The Dutch Pioneers. There Is The Samxe Effect Of A Sternly Patriarchal Life, On Guard Against Natural And Human Enemies, But Aiore Concerned To Be Let- Alone Than To Adventure Farther. The Racial Types, However, Are Much More Picturesque And Unconsciously Romantic, And There Is Much More Colour In The Costumes-Red Predoninating To An Extent .Which Gains Eredit For The Artist In Controlling It. The Subjects Of Velazquez At Grass, Having Stoutened And Let Their Beards Grow And Exehanged An Urban For A Pastoral Dignity, -Would Be A Fair Description Of Several Of Tho Figures. The Justice Of The Peace, Holding His Silver-Handled Whip In One Halnd And A Documept In The Othel, Is Typical. His Judgments, One Feels, Would Minglo The Nobility Of Don Quixote With The Shrewvdness Of Sanchlo Panza. The Healer, The Butcher, And The Master Are Other Striking Realizations Of Character, But It Is In The Compositions Of Several Figures, Such As Cakes At The Races, Women In The Shade Of A Reed Thatch, Lances And Guitars, And The Minstrel And The Herdsmen That Seinor Quir6S Excites Our Keenest Interest In Both Subject Matter And Pictorial Arrangement. Three Of The Landscapes Are Nocturnes, And They, Together With The Accomplished Painting Of Flowers And Silver On A Table, S Sun Patches, Suggest Some Affinity With The French Painters Of Coloured Twilight, Such As Le Sidaner. It Was Well To Include These Pictures, Because They Show That-The Artist Can Adapt His Methods To His Materials. The Dance, In Which The Figures Are Reduced To A Flicker In The Moonlight Against The White Wall Of A House, With A Dim Glow In The Windows, Is An Adtnirable Piece Of Pictorial Reticence.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS168109096/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=84c57aa5,,
Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1932-Oct-03,"London, England","Art Exhibitions Pictures By Army Officers Intelligent Modesty Of Aim The Army Officers Art Society, Now Holding Its Eighth Exhibition At The Suffolk Street Galleries, Has Long Ceased To Depend-If It Ever Did Depend-For Interest On The Suggestions Of Its Title, Though It Undoubtedly Gains In Distinctive Character From Its Constitution. The Kind Of Watercolour Intended By Mir. Bernard Shaws Colonel Of The Old Water-Colour School Can Be Found In The Present Exhibition, But It Is So Much In The Minority As To Make The Jest A Compliment, As Meaning That A Sense Of Proportion And Order And Skill In The Control Of A Difficult Medium Would Be Presumptive Evidence Of A Good Soldier-By No Means An Extravagant Claim. The Exhibition, Of 300 Works, Is Verv Well Drilled In Open Order, And Every Picture Gets Its Chance. Allowing For Variety, A Rough Division Can Be Made Between Works Which Have What Are Felt To Be The Special Virtues Of The Amateur, And Works Which Follow, More Or Less Successfully, Professional Practice. Typical Of The First Class Ate The Small Bright Oil Paintings By Lieutenant-Colonel F. A. Goddard. For Convenient Description They Are Pre-Raphaelite Paintings, But They Have What The Kind Generally Lacks, A Precision In Tone Registration To Match Their Precision In Drawing. A Pond Is As Good An Example Of Detailed Statement, With Everything Kept In Its Place, As One Could See Anywhere, And It Has, Moreover, Great Charm Of Restrained Colour. Another Excellent Painting By The Same Artist Is Clock Golf, In Which The Relation In Space Between The Two Girls, Dressed Alike, Is Decided As Much Bv Tone Of Blue And White As By Comparative Size. How Rare Is This Combination Of Gifts May Be Seen By Looking At Other Works In A Somewhat Similar Style Such As The Water-Colour Near Srinagar, Kashmir, By Captain H. R. Dixon-Smith. In Both General Plan And Detail The Drawing Is Excellent, But The Relations Ih Colour Do Not Explain The Relations In Space So Perfectly As They Do In The Work Of Colonel Goddard. He Is Cultivating A Small Field, But He Is Cultivating It With The Most Admirable Taste And Skill. In What May Be Called The Sargentesque Way Ot Painting Thc Niost Brilliant Piece Of Work Is- Pigs In Slinlight, By Captain W. L. T. Fisher. Hc Has Observed, But Not Lost His Head Over, The Circumstance That The Shadows On White Objects In Sunlight Are Blue, And The Painting Is Joyously Swung Together. On The Whole, However, Thc Honours In The Mnore Professional Kind Of Painting Must Go To Colonel Wv. S. S. Harvest. Lic Has Seven Landscapes In Oil, All Distinguished By Breadth Of Touchi And Plcasantly Cool Colour. Hrece In Particular May Be Named- A Sunset, Boumemouth, Wistful In Gesture And Tender In Colour-Rather Like A Steer- The Valley Of Thc Auber, In Vhich Elaborate Detail Has Not Weakened The Grasp Of The Main Features, And A Street .Ene, The Markusturm, West Side, Rothenburg. There Is A Quiet Assurance About Thc Landscape Work Of Colonel Harvest Which Is Very Pleasing. What Strikes One Most About The Exhibition As A Whole Is The Prevailing Intelligent. Modesty Of Ainm. There Are Very Few Arnbitious Performances. The Most Obvious Is A Large Figure Subject-A Rembrandt Composition It Might Be Called- Talitha Cumii-I Am The Resurrection And The Lifc, By Lieutenant-Colonel H. Paul Ireeby. The Artist Has Not Quite Known What To Do With The Shape Of The Large Area Of White Formed By Thc Bed, But The Picture Is Good In Feeling, Unconventional In The Physical Types, And Singularly Attractivc In The Colour Scheme Of Green, Whitc, And Mauve. The Exercises In What May Be Callcd Rhythmical Solidity, With Horses For The Subjects, By Lieutenant C. S. Brownlow, Are Interesting. That Thcy Should Break Down In Places Is Not Surprising, For To Keep Up A Continuous Movement In Three Dimensions Is Extremely Difficult. A Genuine Artistic Sensibility Is Expressed In The Water-Colours Of Moorland And Coast Scenery By Major-General Sir Arthur Scott. Carefully, Though Loosely, Drawn, And Carried Out In A Limited Scald Of Tones, With Blue-Grey And Mauve Predominating, They Are Delightful Examples Of Their Kind. Sandsend Bay, Whitby, And Newton Dale, Yorks, May Be Specially Mentioned. Other Pictures To Be Noted In A Necessarily Glancing Record Are From My Window, By Colonel R. J. Strachey, Market Day, Vannes. By Mlajor F. A. Wilkinson, Old Mill, Wickham, By Captain J. B. Slade-Baker. And Cork Trees. Hyeres, By Lieutenant-Colonel W. Howel Jones. All Available Profits From The Sale Of Catalogues Will Be Devoted To The Soldiers, Sailors And Airmens Families Association. Miodern English School At The Galleries Of Messrs. Tooth And Son, 155, New Bond Street, The Contemporary Art Society Is Holding An Exhibition Of About 50 Oil Paintings, Water-Colours, And Draxwings Which It Has Acquired. This Has Every Clairn To Be-Considered A Thoroughly Representative Collection Of Modern English Painting If A Foreigner Wished To Know What The English Had Done Recently He Might Conveniently Be Referred To This Exhibition. The Societys Selection Is Cxtremely Eclectic, As, Of Coursc, It Should Be. There Is Even One Work Which Is Entirely Academic In The Ordinary Sense Of The Word, Though Not In The Technical Sense Which Allows One To Call A Cubist Picture Academic. It Is No Reproach To The Society That It Scems To Have Bought With Extraordinary Impartiality, Now Choosing Works Which Are Almost Entirely Illustrative, And Now The Most Uncompromising Displays Of Pure Painting. And It Is Probably Not So Much An Indication Of The Societys Taste, As Of The Taste Of The Available Painters, That There Is So Large A Proportion Of Works Which Can Only Be Described As Mannered. All The Temptations Of The Mannerist, The Cultivation Of Minor Clegancies And Flourishes, Exaggerations Of Rhythm And Curiosities Of Texture, Together With A Certain Quaintness In Illustration, May Be Studied In This Exhibition. Messrs. Paul And John Nash, Messrs. Stanley And Gilbert Spencer, Mr. Ben Nicholson, Mr. Edward Wadsworth, Mr. Cedric Morris, Mr. Neville Lewis, And Mr. David Jones Are All Represented By Characteristic Works. Often, Of Course, Their Ingenuity Is Very Seductive-If Mannerism Were Quite As Pointless As Historians Of Art Pretend When They Come To The Period Of The Mannerists It Would Never Be Practised-But One Can Hardly Cscape The Conclusion That This Exhibition Is Overloaded With Charm. But There Are A Number Of Most Serious And Eminent Works To Restore The Balance. Two Fine Works By Mr. Sickert A Still-Life By Mr. Duncan Grant, Which Is Perhaps Not An Entirely Representativc Work, Since, Though The Colour Is Equal To His Best, The Flowers Have A Papery Lack Of Solidity Which Is Not At All Characteristic Of This Artist A Large And Imposing Still-Life By Mr. M1Ark Gcrtler- In -Hisi Most Uncompromising Manner A Grave And Intellectual Design, The Top Floor, By Mr. Robert Medley, Which Is Painted With A Robust Mastery Of The Medium Mr Roger Frys Sussex Downland, An Unusually Romantic Work And Several Of Mr. William Roberts Elaborate Designs-These Are Enough To Restore The Gravity Of The Exhibition And To Prove The Scriousness Of The Contemporary Art Societys Taste.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS335750979/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=994c9222,,
Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1930-Jul-11,"London, England","Entertainments Art Exhibitions Mr. Herbert Haseltine Any Feeling Of Uncertainty About Mir. Herbert Haseltines Purely Sculptural Powers-His Capacity For Translating Natural Forms Into Terms Of Bronze Or Stone In A Composition Of Niasses Which Shall Be Satisfying Irrespective Of What It Represents-Is Put Aside In Appreciation Of His Tact, Judgment, And Skill In Tho Application Of Such Powers As He Lundoubtedly Has. Having Observed That The Animals-The Suffolk Punch, The Percheron, And The Champion Bull-Which Predominate In His Present Exhibition At Messrs. Knoedlers, 15, Old Bond-Street, Are Sculptural In Themselves, He Wisely Lets Them Alone, Contenting Himself With A Slight Stylization Of The Forms And A Slight Emphasis Upon Planes, And Devoting Himself To A Decorative Treatment Of Surface Character, Coat And Mane, So That Each Piece Becomes A Work Of Beautiful Craftsmanship. In Principle He Followvs The Example Of The Chinese Artists Of The Tangor, Rather, Wei-Dynasty. Except On Account Of The Beauty Of The Material It Would Not Be Easy To Say Why Mr. Haseltines Work In Stone Gives More Pleasure Than His Work In Bronze But There Is Nothing In His Present Exhibition That Leaves Such A Satisfying Impression As Suffolk Ptmch Stallion Sudbourne Premier And Percheron Stallion Rhum, In Burgundy Stone-Even Though The Bronze Version Of The First Has Mane Ornaments Of Lapis Lazuli And Onyx Eyes. Hereford Bull Twvyford Fairy Boy, In Bronze, Partially Plated With Gold, Shows To Advantage His Way Of Giving Decorative Interest To Surface By A Conventional Treatment Of The Locks Of Lhair. It Is When One Comes To The Slighter Aninials, Such As The Thoroughbred Horse Composite Type And Polo Pony Perfection That One Begins To Wonder If Mr. Haseltines Work Is As Good As It Looks Whether It Does Not Represent A Simplified Anatomy Rather Than A Sculptors Grasp Of The Volumes And, Beautiful As They Are From The Craftsmanship Point Of View, And Wvell Proportioned In General Designthe Beast Being In One Block With The Pedestal-It Is Questionable If His Two State Bullocks, In Burgundy Stone, Do Not Escape From Formal Control. There Is A Slight Effect Of Something Beginning To Knelt. A New Departure For Mr. Haseltine Is Thle Mlodel, In Gilded Bronze, Of An Equestrian Statue Of The Sixteenth-Century Warrior, Jam Rawvalji, For The Present. Maharajah Jmnsalieb Of Nawanagar, To Be Completed On The Heroic Scale. So Far As The Horsealert And Erect, With Iwvard Pricked Ears --Is Concerned, It Looks As If It Would Enlarge Satisfactory, But The Figure Of The Warrior Seems To Need A More Construetive Treatment. It Is Not True In Sculpture Thlat Nature Never Lets You Down. A Mnild Protest May Be Entered Here Against The Increasing Lhabit Of Wvhat May Be Called Freak Catalogues To Art E.Xhibitions-Odd Shapes And Sizes, With Trimmings. Mr. Haseltines Bears On Its Cover A Thin Brass Plate, With An Incised Design In Black Of A Horses Head. This Is Very Pretty And All That, But The Corners Of The Plate Inevitably Detach Themselves, To The Risk Of Scratching The Hand And Making Inconvenient The Preservation Which The Photographic Illustrations Deserve. Apart From Practical Disadvantages, Too, Such Adventitious Aids Are Bolund To Create The Subconscious Impression-Obviously Unjustified In This Case-That The Exhibition Cannot Be Trusted To Stand On Its Own Merits. Lefevre Galleries The Least Mannered Of The Wlorks In Sculptture And. Drawings By Mr. Csaky, A Naturalized Frencli Artist Of Hungarian Extraction, At The .Lefevre Galleries, La, Ksing-Stieet, St. Jamess, Are Laigle, In Black Basalt, And Ly N Endoin I In Bronze. These Are Very Good Compositions, Close To The Materials Of Wvhich They Are Rnade, And Fiumly Simphfliqd In The Treatment Of Form. Together With Soine Vases, In Bronze, And Such Little Statuettes As Fenmme Debout And Femme Au Miains Eroisees, They Leave The Impression That Mdr.

To The Average Amateur Of Art Mogul Painting May Appear Very Much All Of A Piece, But The E,Hibition Is Skilfully Designed To Show The Various Influences That Went To Its Formation This Style Was Compounded Of Four Different Ingredients And Each Of These Is Displayed And Distinguished On Separate Screens. The Most Curious Shows The Influence Of European Art Jesuit Missionaries Brought Samples Of Christian Art, Mainly Flemish And Gerran Engravings But Also Flemish Miniature Paintings, To The Court Of Akbar, And A Little Later Secular Painting Of The European School Became Known When Sir Thomas Roe Showed Miniatures, Probably Of The School Of Hilliard, To Jabangir. This Influence Produced A Number Of Works That Seem More Strange Than Beautiful, And There Are Some Very Singular Examples Of Paintings Done Over European Engravings, But. It Appears That Mogul Painting Did In Fact Owe Some Of Its Atmospheric Effect And Sense Of Space To European Art. Nevertheless It Was The Introduction Of Persian Art By Akbar And Other Rulers Which Had The Most Profound Effect On The Indian Painting Of This Time, And The Most Refined And Exquisite Miniatures Are To Be Found Among Those In Which The Persian Influence Predominates.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS34296658/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=08e38967,,
Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1891-Apr-14,"London, England","Art Exetbit10Ts. We Are Glad To Welcome The New English Art Club Back To The Dudley Gallery In Piccadilly From Their Temporaly Exile At Knightsbridge. There They Had To Be Content With Rooms That Were Never Intended For The Display Of Pictures And, In Spite Of The Praiseworthy Efforts Of The Members To Convince The Public Of The Superiority Of Side Lights To Top Lights, The Exhibition Was A Failure. In Their Old Quarters We Can See Tho Pictures Perfectly And, According To Our Temperament, Enjoy Or Dislike To The Full These Audacious Attempts To Mako The British Public See Nature Through Artists Eyes. People Who Visit Picture Galleries Have By This Time Learned To Know What They Must Expect From The New English Art Club, An Association Of Young Men And Women, Not All Of Them English, Who Paint For The Most Part Under Influences Which Come To Them From Paris Through Mr. Whistler. The Word Impressionism Has Gradually Become More And More Limited In Its Technical Meaning, But, Broadly Speaking, It Is The Word That Best Describes The General Character Of The Art In This Room. The Impressionism, Indeed, Of M. Blanche Is Very Different From That Of Messrs. Henry And Hornel That Of Mr. Paul Maitland Is Far Removed Fiom That Of Mr. Alexander Roche. But Still The Word, For Want Of A Better, Must Serve To Cover Them All. All The Painters Here Are Preoccupied With The Desire To Paint Things As They See Them To Paint Pictures And Not Illustrations Of Literature To Solve Artistic Problems, And To Banish And Utterly Forego Each And All Of The Non-Artistic Qualities Which The English Mind Is Accustomed To Associate With Works Of Art. Their Work, Therefore, Will Only Appeal To A Relatively Small Public, Though An Increasing One. The Present Exhibition Is, On The Whole, An Adequate Measure Both Of The Abilities Of Theso Young Painters And Of The Leading Tendencies In The Art Of The Present Time. Sincerity, Great Labour, And A Strong Desire To Get At Truth Of Impression Are Evident In The Work Of Such Men As Mr. P. W. Steer, Mr. Walter Sickert, Mr. George Thomson, Mr. Edward Stott, Mr. Francis Bate, And Mir. Frod Browrn, To Mention Only A Few Out Of Many And The Same May Be Said Of The Pictures Of Two Accomplished Foreign Members Of The Club-Ndi. Blanche And Roussel. All Of These Show Capital Work, Perhaps The Most Conspicuous Successes Being Mr. George Thomsons The Skating Rink 4, Air. Sickerts Dieppe 42, And M. Blanches The Pink Rose 26. The Last, Howeveri Clever And Interesting As It Is, Might Very Wvell Be Taken To Show That These Artists, In Their Revolt Against Tradition, Are But Flying From One Conventionality To Another. The Childs White Face Is Not Nature It Is M. Blanches Parti Pris. The Dieppe Is Extremely Clever, And Is, Moreover, A Charming Picture While Mr. Thomson Has Succeeded In A Remarkable Degreo In Giving Movement To His Skaters. Of The Landscapes, Those Of Mr. Laidlay, Mr. Bate, And Mir. Bellingham Smithwvill, Perhaps, Attract The Most Attention And, Among The Portraits, Mfr. Steers M Lrs. Cyprian Wvilliams And Her Children And Mr. J. J. Shannons Sketch-Profile Of The Duchess Of Portland Are Noteworthy. A Word Should Be Added Of Lhfr. Paul Maitlands Extremely Careful Pastel, A Lamplight Scene Of The Streets 98, Of Mr. F. A. Jacksons Study Of Geese 71, Of Miss S. C. Harrisons Portrait Head 7I And Of A Clever Sketch By Mir.

Null,Art Exhibition,The Times,1912-Jul-19,"London, England","Miniatures. , , Miniature Painting Seems To Be In A Flourishing Condition, Although The Books Tell Us That It Died When Photography Was Born. It Had, Indeed, A Time Of Eclipse, But It Has Come Forward Again With Votaries More Numerous Than Ever.. Besides The Exhibitors Who Show At The -Academy, Where They Are Not Very Well Treated, There Are In London Two Large Societies, Whereof The One Which Bears The Prefix Royal Has Filled The Gallery Of The Royal Water-Colour Society, In Pall-Mall East, With Some 270 Of Its Productions. Of No Kind Ot Art Is It More Difficult To Give An Account- That Shall Really Distinguish, For In The Painting Of Small Portraits Like Theseand Nine-Tenths Of The Exhibits Are Portraits The Differences Of Style Are Naturally Small. The Late Sir Richard Holmes, Who Was Keeper Of The Royal Collection Of Miniatures, Once Gave A Lecture On The Art, And Illustrated It By Coloured Photographs Of The Size Of Life, Which He Threw Upon The Lanternscreen. Then Indeed It Was Easy Enough To See The Difference Between The Bad And The Good, Between The Careful And The Perfunctory, Between The Artistic And The Conventional. One Could Not Only See The Greatness Of Holbein And Cooper And The Comparative Weakness Of Cosway And Firmer, But One Could Distinguish In A Moment Between These Two Men, And Between Both Of Them And Their Contemporaries Like Engleheart. But The Modern Miniaturist Has Not To Submit To Any Such Cruel Test, Which Is Perhaps Fortunate. A Large Number Of The Exhibitors Produce Portraits Which Are Agreeable And Fairly True, The Goodness Of The Likeness Depending In Many Cases On. The Aid Given By Photography, Which Has Now Been-, Summoned As An Ally, After Having At First Been Regarded As An Enemy. The Large Majority Of The Artists Are Ladies, And Among Them, Though Selection Is. Not. Easy, An Impartial Judge Might Honestly Give High Praise To Quite 15 Or 20. To. Follow, The Order Of The Catalogue, We Admire The Work Of Miss K. W. Walker 11, Miss Myra Luxmoere 13, Miss Hepburn-Edmunds 15, Mrs. Rapley Wood 40, Who Paints Hair Admirably. Miss E. M. Burgess 58, Miss M. E. Broadhead 83, Miss Burrell With Some Royal Portraits 92, 94, Miss Emilio King 142, Miss Inez Buchanan 176, Miss B. J. Johnson 204, And Miss E. G.

Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1940-May-22,"London, England","Entertainments Art Exhibitions Sculpture And Drawings At Stafford Gallery Sculpture And Drawings By Sculptors Are The Present Attraction At The British Art Centre, Stafford Gallery, 13, St. Jamess Place. The Feature Is A Collection Of Works By Mrs. Elsa Fraenkel, Who Has Won Favourable Attention By The Combined Subtlety And Firmness Of Her Portrait Heads. So Far As Can Be Judged She Is A Portrait Rather Than A Monumental Sculptor, And Her Affinities Appear To Be With The East Rather Than With The Mediterranean. A Characteristic, Suggesting A Subjective Approach, Is That Many Of Her Heads Are Represented With Closed.Eyes. It Is, No Doubt, The Accident Of Physical Type That Makes The Very Rev. Haham Dr. M. Gaster Work Out A4Tonishingly Like A Chinese Sage, But There Are Several Other Heads That Recall Khmer Bronzes In Their Firm Simplification Without Loss Of Expression. An Interesting Contrast Is Presented By Mathematician Working And Mathematician Lecturing. In The Former The Eyes Are Closed And The Whole Expression Is Inward, While The Second, With Open Eyes. Gives Out All The Time. Sidney Sabin, Of Which The Subject Happens To Be Familiar, Speaks For Mrs. Fraenkels Power Of Getting A Lileness, And Madeleine And Swiss Pianist Are Other Good Examples Of Her Sensitive Art. Her Drawings Are Of An Infinite Delicacy, Retiring Into The Paper So That Plastic Quality Is Not Lost For All The Slightness Of Delineation. In The Mixed Exhibition Of Sculpture And Drawings 51 Artists Are Represented, Including Mr. Jacob Epstein, Mr. Frank Dobson, Miss Dora Clarke, Miss -Dora Gordine, Miss Barbara Hepworth, Miss Gertrude Hermes. Mr. Maurice Lambert, Mr. Benno Schotz, And Mr. John Skeaping. It Is A Most Interesting Collection In A Great Variety Of Styles. The Nude At The Leger Gallery, 13, Old Bond Street, There Is The Sixth Exhibition Of The Nude In Contemporary Art. In Spite Of The Fact That Works From France, Where They Do This Sort Of Thing Better On The Whole, Are Few And Far Between, It Strikes One As Above, The Average Of The Series. One Reason Is, Undoubtedly, Because The Exhibition Contains Fewer Works Among The 70 Or So Pictures And Drawings In Which The Nude Model Is Not Translated Into The Condition Of Painting. By Far The Most Complete And Consistent Example Of This Translation Is The Broadly Painted Foreshortened Figure By Mr. Matthew Smith. This Has An All-Through Character Which Is Lacking To Some Extent Even In The Excellent Composition By Rodrigo Moynihan, In Which The Figure Is Felt To Be In A Slightly Less Degree Of Translation Than The Surroundings, Which Include Flowers And The Small Reflected Figure Of The Painter. Another Delightfully Consistent Piece Of Work Is The Small Study 6, By Miss Ethel Walker, A.R.A., And The Deeply Recessed Reflected Figure 12 By Mr. Walter Sickert Has Its Own Charm Of Low-Toned Colour. Other Artists Who Bring Distinction Into A Collection In Which There Is Very Little That Is Positively Unpleasant Are Mr. Duncan Grant. Lord Methuen, Mr. Kenneth Rowntree, Mr. Robin Darwin, Mr. Arnold. Mason, A.R.A., Mlrs.

With Paimtings By Mr. Ernest Procter And Mrs. Dod Procter- In One Room, Paintings By Mr. Leon De Smet In Another, And Drawings And Statuettes By The Late Mr. William Caine In A Third, Thetleicester Galleries May Be Said To Fulfil The Claims Of Solidity, Colour, And Humour. Though They Are Not Sworn To The Place, The Procters Represent An Intersting Develop. Ment Of The Newlyn School. To A Certiiin Extent They Take The Same Subject Matter-The Fisherfolk, The Streets, And The Harbour-But Give To It A Formal As Well As An Illustrative Interest. It Is Their Retention Of A Reasonable Amount Of The Latter Which Distinguishes Them From The Whole-Hoggers For Plastic Design. Of Their Plastic Sense There Can Be No Doubt Whatever, But They Somehow Seem To Be Able To Indulge It Without Distortmg Or Dehumanizing Their Subjeots. Simplification Without Distortion Mnight Be Their Motto. Moreover-And Nar-Ticularlyirgmr. Procter-They .Show More Consistency Than Most In Making Colour And Substance Contribute To Their Plastic Effects. Mir. Proctor Has The More Lively Imagination, The Keener Taste For Colour In The Abstract, And The More Sensitive Feeling For Atmosphere In Landscape. His Biost Inportant Contribution Is, However, A Sculptural Exercise, The Neglectful Shepherd, With The Feminine Reason For His Neglect, In Subsequent Repose. It Is A Long Picture, Remotely Resembling The Botticelli Mars And Venus In Composition, But Much More Complicated In The Relations Between The Two Figures. The Disposition Of The Limbs Working Out As A Horizontal Figure Of Eight. No Praise Can Be Too High For The Combined Logic And Grace With Which The Group Is Treated. The Light Would Appear To Be That Of The Moon, Or Of Early Dawn, Reducing The Colour Scheme To Pale Gold And Purple Grey, So That Nothing Is Allowed To Weaken The Sculpturalunity Of The Whole. Mr. Proeterisalso Represented By Some Excellent Landscapes, Newlyn And Porthsvw8Rra For Choice, Studies For Decorations, A Record Of The Burmese Visit Which Did So Much To Confirm The Powers Of Both Artists, And Some Smaller Pictures Including A Delightful Study Of The Fantastic Movement Of Chairoplanes. Mrs. Procter Has Put All Her Science And Skill Into A Baby, Lying On His Back On A Blue Cushion On A Mound Of Grey Rugs. Apart From All The Other Merits Of This Picture, Happy Placing, Incisive, Drawimg, And Beauty Of Colour, One Cannot Sufficiently Admire The Nice Graduation Of The Handling, Distinguishing Textures But Keeping Everything In The Unity Of Pigment. Almost Equally Good Are The Half-Lengths Of Janey And Girl In Blue -The Latter Made Very Interesting In Design By The Arrangement Of The Arms -Both Combining With Their Formal Qualities A Reserved Appreciation Of Human Character. Somehow The Landscapes And Still Life Subjects By Mrs. Procter Do Not Reach The Same High Level, But They Are All Serious Exercises. There Is A Distinct Affinity Between The Work Of These Two Interesting Young Painters And The Sculptture Of Mr. Frank Dobson, And It Represents A Very Healthy Movement In Contemporary English Art. Mir. Non De Smet Is, Before Everything, A Decorative Colourist, Finding His Most Characteristic Expression In Stilllife Subjects, Including Flowers, And Portraits In Costumes That Allow Him To Idulgehis Enjoyment Of Pattern. Hisaim Is To Provide A Festival For The Eye, And In A Bowl Of Flowers, The Green Tray, And Zinnias He Comes Near To Persuading Us To Give Ourselves Up To It. The Most Attractive Of His Figure Subjects Is A Merry-Go-Round, In Which The Decorations Of The Machine Itself Have Helped His Design. Nobody, So To Speak, Knew That The Late Mr. William Caine Was An Artist As Well As, The Author Of Extravagantly Humorous Novels. His Drawings, Mostli Illustrations To The Gluttons Mirror, Published By Messrs. Fisher Unwin, Have The Same Extravagance The Same Down- A Right Statement In A Reckless Disregard Of Probability. Very Bold And Simple In Style, They Are Exuberant In Imagination And Quite Out Of Bounds In Caricature. You Accept Them As You Accept The Situation In Lady Shebas Last Stunt. Even More Astonishing Are The Fantastic Bronzes By The Same Artist, Representing Types And Accidents In A Sort Of Chinese Baroque, With Plastic Feeling In Every Curve. Mer. Russeill Flint. To A Certain Extent Mr. W. Russell Flint, A.R.A., Suffers From His Own Facility In The Handling Of Water-Colour For The Purposes Of Gradation, And There Ore Signs In The Exhibition Of His Recent Works In That Medium At The Galleries Of The Fine Art Society, 148, New Bondstreet, That He Is Trying To Break Himself Of A Habit Which Limited The Expression Of His Powers As A,Painter. To Put It Crudely, He Is Flattening His Style And Rolying More On The Natural Tendency Of The Wash, While Rightly Preserving The Distinction Between More Or Lass Realistic Studies From Nature And The Decorative Illustra. Tions.Which Represent Another Side Of His Talent. That It Will Cost Him S,Oire Im.Nediate Popularity Is Likely Enough, But Tle Findl Result Is Bound To Be For The Better. . In Certain Landscapes, Such As Headlands Of Morvern, Abendberg, .Grimmnialp, And Vanishing Mistssannox Bay, Arran, He Has Already Gone The Whole Way And Allowed The Pic. Ture To Form Itself Out Of Washes In Just Relations Of Tone And Colour. It Is In The -Relation Of. Figures To Landscape, Par. Ticularly Nude Figures, That The Defect In Mr. Flints Style Has Been Most Apparent, And Here He Has Undoubtedly Gained From Painting In Switzerland, Where Figures Tell Against The Snow In Flat Colour. The Ski Partys Return, With Its Enchanting Design -A La Japanese, Is Actually The Best Of The Swiss Pictutes, But Lthe Rink With Its Unshadowed Relation Of Figures To The Ice, Is A Good One And There Are Several Others Which Give Pleasure. In His Pictures Of Girls Bathing, Mr. Flint Always Gains By The Addition Of Drapery-As In Rthree Models, In Which Deck Chairs Play A Connecting Part Between Bare Flesh And Landscape. The Statue By The Sea, In Which Living And Sculptured Forms Are -Compared, Has Its Own Interest. The Abbey Gallery. The Best Of The Water-Colours Of Xorth Frica, -Italy, 8Icily, And France By Mr. A.

FROM A CORRESPONDENT,Italian Art,The Times,1929-Dec-30,"London, England","Entertaininents Italian Art British Museum Exhibition From A Correspondent Thie British Museum Has Arranged To Open Early In January A Special Display Of Italian Art Supplementary To The Burlington House Exhibition. The Department Of Manuscripts Possesses Some Of The Finest Work Of The Italian Miniaturists, And A Selection Of These Illuminations Widl Be Placed On View In The Grenville Library Of The Museum Adjoining The Vestibule On January 6. Ont The Following Day A Larger Exhibition Of The Museums Italian Drawings, Woodeuts, And Engravings Will Be Opened To The Public In That Section Of The King Edward Vii. Galleries Normally Reserved For Select Prints. Of The 41 Maniuscripts Chosen For Exhibition In The Grenville Library The Majority Are Works Of Devotion. The Earliest Of These Is The 12Thcentury Beneventan Esultet Roll Reproduced This Year, In Which The Writing And Illuminations Face In Opposed Directions. The Latest Are A Collection Of Small Florentine Books Of Htours And A Breviary From Santa Croce In Florence, All Of Which Can Be Dated In The Last Years Of The 15Th Century. By Arranging The Manuscripts In A Rough Chronological Order It Will Be Sholn How The Work Of The Miniaturist Changed Between The Interlaced Initials Of A 12Th-Century Psalter And The Splendid Climax Of The Sforza Book Of Rours. The Sforza Book, Iuluminated For Ludovico Sforza-Visconti, Duke Of Milan, About 1490, Is One Of The Principal Treasures Of The Museum, And Is Seldom Placed On View For Fear Of The Brilliant Colours Fading. Its Flemish Mriiatures Were, However, Displayed As An Accompaniment To The Exhibition Of Flemish Art In 1927, Anid Four Pages Of The Milanese Minia. Tures In The Book Will Now Be Seen. Associated With This Are Two Other Works In The Museum Collection. One Is The Contemporary Sforza Deed, Granting Lands From Ludovico To His Duchess, Beatrice Deste. This Contains His Signature Aud A Flnely Painted Border With Medallion Portraits Of Both Ludovico And Beattrice. The Second Is The Sformiada, A Vellum-Printed Life Of Liidovicos Predecessor. Francesco, Illuminated With Portraits Of Both Dukes. The Humanistic Manuscripts Of The I 5Th Century Will Be Well Illustrated In A Volunme Of Livy. A Copy Of Augustines De Civitate Dei, A Plutarch, And A Duns Scotus, While Two Petrarchs Done For Members Of The Medici Family Will Stand As Examples Of The Best Florentine Craftsmanship. The Most Interesting Work To Be Exhibited, However Apart From The Sf-Rza Documents, Is A Treatise On The Vices, Illuminated In The Late 14Th Century By A Genoese Artist. Lthe Painter, Who Is Traditionally Supposed To Have Been The Monk Cvbo Of Hyeres, Was Evidently Familiar With Oriental Miniatlures. His Illustration Of Gluttony, For Istance, Is A Lively Picture Of A Tartar Monarch Feasting Among His Courtiers To The Straims Of Negro Music, And -He Intersperses W Ithin His Text Representations Of Insect Life, W,Hich Show Almost Certain Contact With The W,Ork Of Arab Naturalists. Leonardo Da Vinci The Productions Of The Miniaturists Are Unsigned And Individual Illuminators Can Rarely Be Identified. The 120 Drawings, On The Other Hand, Which Will Be Seen In The King Edward Vii. Gallery, Have Been Chosen As Illustrations Of The Technique Of Various Known Masters, Quite As Nmuch As For Their Beauty In Themselves. Before Fra Filippo Lippi And The 15Th-Century Florentine School Only A Few Of The Museums Italian Drawings Are Of Interest, But They Include A Pisanello And Several Specimens Of The Schools Of Verona And Tuscany, Dating From Just Before 1400. These Will Be Seen In January, And With Them The Botticelli Flgures Of Abundance And Fate, A Wonderful Verrocchio Head, And Three Drawings By Lorenzo Di Credi. Contemporary Are The North Italians Led Byi Mantegna, Of Whose Drawings The British Museum, More Fortunate Than Any Other Gallery, Poswssses Six Examples. Four Will Be Shown, Flanked By A Selection Of Florentine Drawings By Filippino Lippi And Fra Bartolomiieo And By The Umbrians-Luca Signorelli, Pietro Perugino, And Melozzo Da Forli. Nine Drawings Bv Leonardo Da Vinci Wiil Be Idisplatyed Together. The Sketch Of The Virgin And Child Plaving With A Kitten, And Tli Head Of A Warrior Wvearing A Helnct, Are Probably The Best Known Of These, Bu. There Is Also A Drawving By Leonardo Of One Of His Mor L- Dvilish War-Machines Surrounded Bv Scythes. Which Mow Downi The Enemy. The S!Icceediing Group Contains The Milane.,E Nmaster Anibrogio La Predis And A Selectioni Of The Veaietians, Especiallv Gentile And Gio-Ainni Bellini, Cima, Carpaccio, Anid An Eariv Loreuizo Lotto. Two Complete Screens Are To Be Devoted To Raphael And Michelangelo. Fourteen Raphaels Will Appear, Including Specimens Of The Rare Silverpoint Drawings, While The 11 Michelangelos Chlosen Display Both The Early Atd The More Mannered Later Style Of That Artist. Andrea Del Sarto, Pontorimo, And Sebastiano Del Piombo Will Be Seen To Advantage And Amonig-The Later Drawings Chosen Are Excellent Exanmples Of Such Venetiani Masters As Titian, Poidenone, Bassano, And Paolo Veronese. Coriegglo, Parmegiano, And Three Superb Baroccios Will Be Grouped Together. The Latest Draughtsman Represented Will Be The Bolognese, Carracci. Woodcuts And Engravings It Will Be Observed That The Collection Of Drawings Chosen Hardly Touches The 14Th Century, But After A Strong Group Of Early 15Th-Century Masters It Becomes More Abundant Up To The Middle Of The 16Th Century And Then Practically Breaks Off. The Woodcuts Anid Enigravinigs Begin Anid End Later, Rangirng From The Middle Of The 15Th Century Almost To The Enid Of The 18Th. A Primitive Woodeut In Red. Blue, And Brown Of About 1440-1450 Is The Earliest To Be Seen And One Of The Most Remiarkable. It Represents The Virgin Anid Child, And Is Of I Type Fr. Rarer Thani The Con-. Temlporary Gernia, Woodcuts. It Is Followed Chronologically By The Work Of That Very Eclectic 16Th-Century Craftsman Known From Hlis Signature As The Master I.B. With A Bird. Three Examples Of His Woodcuts Will Be Slhown, One Reproducing A Painting Of The Crucitixion, The Others In Entirely Distin.T Styles Copying Pictures Of Classical Legends. More Or Less Contetuporarv- Craftsmen Represented Are Domenico Campagnola, Of Padua, Lucantonio Degli Uberti, And Jacobus, Of Strasburg, A German Who Settled In Italy. In The Later 6Ith Century The Works Of Titian Appear To Have Been Popular Subjects For The Copyist, And A Selection Has Been Made Of Woodcuts Done After This Painter. A Presumed Self-Portrait Of Titian Engraved By Giovanni Britto Is Perhaps The Most Noteworthy. Titians Niephew. Cesare Vecellie, The Authority On Costume, Was Himself A Woodcutter, And Two Naively Delightful Works By Him -Are To Be Shown. Onie Depicts The Doge And Senate Sittinig In Council, The Other A Venetian Weddinig Scene In Which The Bride Is Being Conducted To Her Festal Gondola. Far More Finished Are The Chiaroscuro Woodcots Done From Three Or Four Blocks In Different Tones Of The Same Colour, Which Ugo Da Carpi Introduced Into Italy. Many Of Raphaels Paintings Were Reproduced In This Technique And Among The Work Of Ugo Da Carpi Selected For Exhibition Are An Interestig Dliogentes After Parmegianio, A Correggio, And A Pordonone Taken From A Fresco Now Perished. Lxamples Will Also Be Given Of Rather Shmilai. Work By Andreani. A Little Later In The 16Th Century, And By Zanetti, Who Revived The Methlod About 1720. The Line Engravings To Be Displayed Are Chiefly Florentine. The Earliest Is A Rather Crude Depiction Of The Killing Of St. Peter Miartyr, Anld There Are A Pleasing Hunting Sc,Ine, A Representation Of Florentine Arts And Crafts From The Planets Series, And An Engravinig Of The Cretan Labyrinth, All To Be Dated Before 1460, Belonging To The School Of Finiguerra. The Most Important Of The Early Series Is A Large Triumph Of Bacchus And Antadne, Acquired By The Museum In Two Separate Pieces From Different Collections. This Is A Work Of Great Beauty, Rather Doubtfully Ascribed To Botticelli, But Certainly Inspired By His School. And The Museums Copy Is Unique. A Line Engraving Of The Assumption Of The Virgin, Dated A Little After 1490, Is Certainly After A Design By Botticelli, And It Is Even More Beautiful Than The Bacchus And Ariadne. The Two Large Pollaiuolos The Battle Of Naked Men And Hercules And The Centaur Chosen To Follow The Botticelli Are Well Known,.And A Selection Has Been Made Of Works By Lucantonio Degli Uberti And Robetta, While Of North Italians We Shall See A -Number Frdm The School Of Mantegna-And A Battle O The Sea-Gods Engsved By That Master Himself. Coming To The 16Th Century, Sped - Mens Have Been Chosen Of The Milanese . T Which Include A Girl With Her Head Crowned With Leaves, Engraved By. One Of Leonardos Pupils, And A Lare Original Comnposition By The Same Anonymous Artist Whose Miniatures Will Be Seen In The Sforza Book Of Hours, Among Other Engravings To Be Shown Are A Reproduction By Mocetto Of A Mgntegna From The Uffzi, Now On Loan At Burlington House, And Works By The Brothers Campagnola, Includng A Very Delicate Design Of A Stag Chained To A Tree. Te Latest Of The Line Engravings To Be Shown Include Seven Specimens Of Marcantonio Raimondis Work, One Reproducing A Raphael Design, To Be Seen At Burlington House, Together With Two Examples Of The Work Of Jacopo Francia, Larcantonios Pil. Only Two Cases Of Etchings Will Be Seeu. The 17Th-Centuryexamnples Chosen Begin With A Group By Stefano Dela Bela, Representing The Florentines Castigione And Biscaino, Who Show The Genoese Style And Giulio Campioni. The Mnost Pleasing Are The Queer Biarie Of Braceui, Whose Figures, Made Up Of Geometrical Shapes And Other Fantastic Constituents, Resemble Designs For A Modern Russian Ballet. Etchings Of The 18Th Century Wiu Be Confined To Two Masters, Tiepolo And Diamantini, And The Eight Frames Eleed Ditplay The Various Styles Of These Masters. No Talian Aquatints Or Mezzotints Wil Be Placed On Exhibition. The Illuminated Manuscripts Will Be On View Only For Three Months, But The Italian Prints And Drawings, Like The Dutch Prints Wbich They Are Now To Displace, Will Probably Be Seen For A Considerable Time After The Pralel Burlington House Exhibition Is Closed. A Very Close Working Arrangement Now Exists Between Burlington House And The British Museum, With Some Overlapping Of Staff. Visitors Will Be Directed From The One Exhibition To The Other By Notes In The Burlington House Catalogue And By Posters Both At Burlington House And In The British Museum. The Victoria And Albert Museum Wiul Hold No Special Exhibition Of Italian Art, As The Best Examples Of Italian Work In The Possession Of The Museum Are Either To Be Seen In Special Collections Already On View Or Are In Books, And, Therefore, Inaccessible For Display. One Very Important Drawing And Two Bronzes From This Museum Have, However, Been Specially Lent To Burlington House, And A Series Of Free Lectures On Subjects Connected With The Burlington Hiouse Exhibition Wil Be Given On Trhursday Evenings At 6.30 In The Victoria And Albert Museum By The Director, Mr. E. R. D. Tmaclagan, And Others. The Arst Of These Will Be Delivered On January 16.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS134816158/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=f94475a9,,

Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1897-Feb-15,"London, England","Art Exhibitions. Armong The Numerous Exhibitions Which Open To The Public To-Day, The Most Important And Interesting Is That At Messrs. Agnews Gallery In Old Bond-Street. The 31St Annual Display Of Old And Modern English Drawings Is In One Way Very Much Like Those Which Have Preceded It That Is To Say, It Consists Of A Number Of Very Carefuuy Selected Works By The Best Masters, Deceased Or Still Living, Of The Englisix School Of Water-Colour Painting. Turner, De Wint, David Cox, Wiliam Hunt-These Are Among The Great Men Of The Bygone Generation Who Are Here Represented In Force While Of Living Artists We Have Important Drawings Of Sir E. Burne-Jones, Hir. Alma Tadema, Mr. Carl Haag, Mr. Briton Riviere, Mr. Birket Foster, And Amiss Mary Gow-Who Sends Four Drawings Of Charming Delicacy And Grace. It Would Be Hard To Say Anything New Of The Art Of The Foar First-Named, Nor Need We Attempt It. The Principal Drawings Mado By Turner Have Been So Often Classified And Described That A Collector And A Turner-Lover Knows Them By Name, And It Is Enough That He Should Be Informed That In A Certain Gallery Ho Can See The Zurich, The Richmond, From The England And Wales Series, And So Forth. These Two Drawings Form The Principal Object On One Of Tho Screans At Messrs. Agnews, And We Are Again Abe To Wonder At The Strange 4Nimagination Which Led Turner To Place His English Richmond On A Mountain-Top As Though It Were Fresole Or Some Other Italian Hill-Built City, And To Make Of Zurich A Blaze Of Colour And Sunlight Such As No More Prosaic Eye Than His Could Identify With That Busy And Homely Swiss Town. All The Same, The Quality Of Theso Two Drawings Is Marvellous, While Of Equal Interest, If Of Less High Finish, Are Such Works As The Oberlahnstein And The Neuwied. Both Of Which Form Part Of The Wonderful Collection Which The Artist Brought Back From His Brief Tour On The Rhine, To Enrich The Cabinet Of His Friend, Ir. Fawkes, Of Farnley. Very Beautiful Is Such An Early Work As The Brecon Castle And Bridge, While In A Vaulted Chadel Wo See One Of The Architectural Studies In Which The Young Turner Found Such Useful Training For His Eye And Hand. De Wint Is More Strongly Represented Than David Cox At The Back Of Tha Same Screen We Have Two Beautiful Aud Unusual Drawings By Him- Grouse-Shooting And Partridge-Shooting -Which He Is Said To Have Painted For The Same Amateur, Mr. Fawkes, And Which Are Marvels Of Broad And Noble Treatment. This Screen Is So Rich That It Might Be Taken To Represent In Miniature Not Oal7Y Ihe Gallely, But Old English Water-Colour Art As A Whole For, Besides The Works That We Have Named, We Have Some Masterly Though Very Slight Sketches By Constable, Four Or Five First-Rate Examples Of William Hunt-Noteespecially The .Egro Boy 219 And Flowers In A Jug 227-Instances Of The Grave Landscapeo Art Of John Varley, Of David Coxs Favourite Hayfield, Of Coploy Fieldings Highly Artificial Renderings Of The Sea And Such A Fine Thing As The -Palace Of The Moorish Kings, Cordova,I By David Roberts, One Of The Best Of Draughtsmen, Whose More Ambitious Oil Pictures Were Often Less Painter-Like Than His Rare Water-Colours Such As This. On The Walls Are Larger Works Of The Same And Other Artists Lie Wints K Onilworth Castle The Sunset Of That Eminent Classicist, George Barret The L Lancaster Of Copley Fielding In His Barret Manner So Noble A Piece Of Colour As The Hospital Of The Pieth, Venice, By James Holland, And, Of More Recent Men, The Remarkable Tournay Cathedral Of Louis Fliighe The Cairo Bazaar Of J. F. Lewis, And Some Beautiful Drawings By Thomas Collier, With Whom Died The Best Of The Successors Of David Cox. The Works Of Living Painters That Will Deservedly Attract Most Attention Are The Icupid And Psyche Of Sir Edward Burnejones-Not His Best-Known Treatment Of The Subject,But The Version Painted In 1866-Andtheseries Of Drawings By Miss Mary Gow To Which We Have Already Referred. Scarcely Any Living Painter Uan Rival This Lady In Her Treatment Of White Lhowing Draperies In Water-Colour, But, What Is More Important, Sho Has A Gift Of- Gracious Composition And Of Realizing Tho Lighter Side Of The Tender Maternal Feeling That Is Rare Indeed. A Small Wvindsor Castle, By Sir Edward Poynter, A Tiny Early Millais 3R. Dicksees Small Watercolour Version Of His Paolo And Francesca, And Various Drawings By Mr. Birket Foster, Including One Of His Largest And Most Elaborate Surrey Scenes, May Be Mentioned As Adding To The Varied Interest Of This Exhibition. At The Fine Art Societys Rooms, Where Recently We Saw The. Leighton Sketches, Mr. Wallace Rimington Now Shows 138 Drawings Illustrating Wanderings In Italy. When, A Few Years Ago, This Artist Exhibited A Similar Series Of Spatush Drawings, They Were Welcomed Not Only As Art But As A Charming Guide Through An Almost Unknown Land Ns The Making Real Of A Number Of Places Which Till Then Had Been To Almoit Every Visitor Mere Names In The Book Of History Or Romance. It Is Not The Same With Italy. For One Person Who Has Visited Valladolid Or Oviedo, A Thousand Have Been To Venice And Verona Nay, Even Amalfi And Teano, Modena And Ferrara, Are No New Discoreries. Mir. Rimingtons Italian Plan Has Necessarily Differed From Hisspanish. Heo Has Sought For The Picturesque Wherever It Was To Be Found, And Has Not Intentionally Left The Beaten Track In Pursuit Of The Relatively Unknowvn. We Confess That We Should Have Felt N. Somewhat Greater Interest In His Enhibition If It Had Satisfied Our Curiosity More If, Like H. Paul Bourget, The Artist Had Given Us A Volume Of Sensations Djtalie Gathered Trom The Vast Unvisited Regions Of It-From The Abruzzi, From Ban, From Taranto. Perhaps, However, Thiis Pleasure Is Only Deferred. The Room Contains The Fruit Of Visits Spread Over Three Years Let Us Hope That In Other Years This Painter, Who Combines Tho Gifts Of The Artist And The Traveller In A Remarkable Way, Will Extend His Researches Southward. We Must Not, However, Be Understood To Say That Mr. Rimirgton Paints Hackneyed Subjects On The Contrary, Be Avoids Them, Though He Has Given Us A Good Many Views Of Well-Known Places. San Gimignano, Volterra, Subiaco, The Lake Of Bolsona, The Lake Of Orta-These Are A Few Of The Places Which He Illustrates, And Of Them The Englieh Wirld Knows But Little. In A Word, There Is Great Variety In These Drawings, And Mr. Rimington Not Only Feels The Spell Of The Places-He Comnmunicates It. Lhe Is An Excellent Draftsman, With A Good Sense ,Of Colour And A Broad, Workmanlike Touch. A Few Doors Off, At Messrs. Dowdeswells, Are Some Drawings By M1R. Arumonier, Whose Reputation As A Landscape-Painter, Always Considerable, Has Been Rising Of Late Years. These Sketches Are Of No Great Importance, But They Are Artistic And Theyr Have, At Least, The Econdary Merit Of Actuality. One Group Of Them Immortalizes, Of All Things In The World, The Old Chain Pier At Brighton, Whose Material Existence Came To A Suddlen End In One Of This Winters Storms. In Mlr. Aumoniers Drawings We See The Old Pier In Life A Rather Languid Life And In Death, With The Waves Beating Over Its Wreck, Its Chains Snapped, Its Pillars Falling Or Fallen. It Was A Kindly Idea Of The Artist Thus To Perpetuate The Last Act Itn The Life Of So Historical Asetructure His Clever Drawings Ought To Be Photographed Sud Published In A Memorial Volume. M R C. E. Holloway, A Painter Who Has Distinctly Gone With The Movement And Bas Become More Impressionist As He Has Grown Older, Shows At The Goupil Gallery A Collection Of Water-Colours And A Few Oil-Sketches, Illustratinf Englirh Scenes, Chiefly Of The Shore, And Views Of Renice. They Are Rapid, Summary Notes, Not All Of Them Successful, But All Showing A Certain Powor Of Free Handling. A Small Fulllength Portrait Of The Artist, By Mr. Whistler, Will Be Looked At With Curiosity. Two More General Exhibitions Dewnnd A Word, Bat Only A Word, Of Notice. The Dudley Gallery Art Society Has Its Annual Water-Colour Exhibition, And At The Hanover Gallery Is A Collection Of Milit-Vy Pictures, Mostly By Lirench Followers Of Bfe.Fsonier And De Neuville.

At The Abbeyi Gmijery, 2, Viceoria-Street, An Exhibition Of Colour-Etchings, Drypoints, Painting8, And Water-Colours By Mr. Edgar L. Pattison Has Been Arranged To Inaugurate A Considerable Improvement Of The Premises. The Whole Of The First Floor Has Now Been Taken Over By Messrs. Deighton And Divided Into Three Galleries, Very Weu Suited To The Exhibition Of Small Works Ot Art, And Two Private Offices. A Word Is Due To The Simplicity And Good Taste With Which The Decoration Of The New Rooms Has Been.Carried Out. 3Fr. Pattisons Work Is Particularly Well Seen In Its Present Quarters, Because It Is Essentially Of A Kind To Suit The Small Domestic Interior Carefully Desizned And Intimate In Feeling. The Colour-Etehings Of Eastern And Southern Subjects Made In One Printing Bya Method Of The Artists Own, Suffer Somewhat From The Effect That The Colour-Pattern Is Not So Subtle As The Linear Desgn-An Effect Difficult To Avoid In Etching-Though A Southern Port, A Nocturne, In Venice, And Tangier Are Good Colour Designs In Themselves But The Objection Does. Not Apply To The English Subjects, Such As The Eisherman, N Near Ry,E, Rye, Harbour, And Landsca E, Of A Bridge, Castle, And Cliff. Here Line, Which Mr. Pattison Handles With Grace And -Ertainty, Plays The Principal Part, The Colour Being Reduced To Sober Tinting, And The Effect Is Charming Indeed. Proofs Of Several Of The Etchings, As Of The Aquatint Geese, Have Been Acquired For The British Museum. But The Most Distinguished Things In The Exhibition Are The Small Water-Colours, Such As Trces, After Rain, And The Castle. Perhaps The Best Way-Of Describing Their Appeal Is To. Say That They Are At The Same Time Romantic In Feelig, And Classical Mn Composition. The Most Attractive Of The Oil Paintings Is The Incoming Tide, Zaanber, A Refined Study In Grey And Buff. All Mr. Pattisons Work Is Carefully Considered, And An Exhibition Of Little Pictures So Perfectly Adapted To Modest Requiremexts Promises Well For The Future Success Of The New Galleries. In Another Room There Are A Few Spanish Water-Colours By Mfr. Anthony Gross, A Young Artist Of Considerable Originality And Promise.

For The Most Part It Consists Of Small But Good Examples Of The Work Of Excellent Artists. In A Small Landscape, Hampstead, Mr. Duncan Grant Has Observed With Unusual Fidelity A Transitory Phase Of Light. Here He Has Not, As So Often, Transposed The Colours Of Nature Into An Entirely Different Key, And The Result Shows That Mr. Grant Would Have Made A Very Sensitive Impressionist. Mr. Richard Sickerts Dieppe -It Is Obviously Not A Very Recent Workis A Most Adroit Conjunction Of Difficult Colours, And Mr-. Keith Baynes, In His Rue De La Republique, Shows Much The Same Kind Of Skill In Conciliating Light And Acid Tints, Though The Actual Quality Of His Paint Still Verges On Brutality. Mr. Matthew Smiths Anemones And Daisies Displays All The Advantages Of A Natural Sense Of Colour, Mr. Adrian Daintreys Greenhouse, Though Painted Witli A Rough Handling, Is Still A Compact Design, And Mr. H. E. Du Plessiss To Be Let Or Sold Is An Engaging Piece Of Realism. By Accepting With No Demur The Oddity Of The Forms Seen From A Casually Chosen View-Point He Has Been Able To Produce A Fantastic Effect With Admirable Ease And Spontaneity. Two Other Works By Mir.

Since The1Last Exhibi-I Tion Of A Similarkindwas Held, In 1922, The Collections Have Been Enriched, Notably By Examples Of The Rajput.

And Child. From The Eighth Century To Its Revival In The 16Th Century Under The Moguls Only S6Attered Relics Of Indian Painting Survive. The Earliest Works Of The Mogul School Were Made Under Persian Influence, Examples Being Shown In Floor-Case V. And In Princess Of The .-House Of Tirnur No. 1, Painted In The Persian Stylerby Al Persian Artist, But With Figures Added In The Indian Style By An Indian Artist. In Its Full Development The Mogul School Became Pre-Eminently A School Of Por- Traiture And Of The Representation Of Cere-! Monies And Hunting Scenes And Subjects. There Are Also In It Occasional Adaptations From Westerm Art-As In The Picture Of A Lady With Her Lover No. 26. But The Mogul School Does Not Exhaust The Interest Of Indian Painting, For Already In The 17Th Century The Purely Native Art Was Reviving An Art More Gentle And Subjective, More Musical In Its Expression. Hindu Legends Provide The Subjects, And There Is Also A Special Class Of Works With Musical Motives, Associated With Different Houriof The Day And Differentemotional Moodsto Which The Artists Sought.To Give A Pictorial Counterpart. It Is Among The Exampiles Of Rajput Painting That Somqe Of The Loveliest Things In The Exhibition Are To Be Found, Such As The Unfinished Nada And Darnavanti Hailing The Moonrise No. 97. Several Other Unfinished Works Show Us The Technical Methods Of The Artists. For Many Pieople The Raiput Pait- Ings, With Their Peculiar Innocence Of Feeling And Grace Of Expiession, Will Be The Most Attractive Side Of The Exhibition.

Both Veterans, Within A Year Or Two Of The Same Age, With About The Same Similarities And Differences In Style As There Are In Their Names, These Two Eminently Satisfying French Painters Might Almost Have Been Invented By Balzac -If He Had Lived A Little Longer. In Artistic Slang They Are Grouped Together As Intimists, And The Name Serves Well Enough To Describe Not Only Their Preoccupation With The Domestic Interior But Also Their Habit Of Dwelling Upon Their Material So As To Extract From It The Last Possibilities In Subtle Colour Relationships. Of The Two Bonnard Has Become The Larger In Style And The More Positive In Colour, Vuillard Renmaining, As They Both Began, An Enthusiast For Subdued Harmonies. It Is Not Easy To Select From This Friendly Demonstration Of The Pleasures Of Painting, But Nature Morte And Le Dejeuner, By Bonnard, And Madame Vuillard Et La Famille Roussel And La Lecture, By Vuillard, Are Among The Happiest Things In The Collection.

In General They Are Birdseye Views, In An Embracing Kind Of Composition, Bringing Everything Into Unity Of Effect, Which Is Sometimes Lyrical, Sometimes Elegiac, And Sometimes Dramatic. Charing Cross Bridge From Shell Mex House And Blackfriars Bridge From South Side May Be Specially Quoted. Of The Portraits Of People The Head Of The Duchess Of Choiseul Makes By Far The Best Impression.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS202322247/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=efe8f72e,,
FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT,Art Collecting In West Riding,The Times,1952-Jun-14,"London, England","Art Collecting In West Riding Exhibition At Temple Newsam From Our Correspondent Leeds, June 13 An Exhibition Of Works Of Art From The Private Collections Of Subscribers To The Leeds Art Collections Fund Was Opened This Evening By Professor Anthony Blunt At Temple Newsam. This Jacobean Mansion, Which Has Become The Principal Art Centre In Leeds, Forms A Perfect Setting For A Remarkable Exhibition Showing The Variety And Scope Of Art Collecting In The West Riding. Without Drawing Upon The Famous Collections At Harewood House And Farnley Hall, The Friends Of Leeds Art Gallery Have, From Their Homes, Brought Together A Collection Of Distinction. In One Room Set Apart For English Water-Colours There Are Fine Examples Of Gainsborough, Cotman, Girtin, Peter De Wint, Morland, Turner, And Paul Sandby, While Two Water-Colours By Anthony Devis Are From A Set Of 14 Which Were Painted For James Lowther, Afterwards Lord Lonsdale, In 1780. Paintings Include Some Of The Works Of Giorgio De Chirico The Gladiators , Mark Gertler, Jacob Kramer The Sphinx , Picasso, Sickert, And Jack Yeats. Modern Sculpture Is Represented In The Work Of Jacob Epstein, Henry Moore, And Barbara Hepworth. Some Rare Pieces Of Seventeenth- And Eighteenth-Century Furniture Are Exhibited, Including One Of The Earliest Known Examples Of A Walnut Writing Table. The Section Devoted To Ceramics Makes Special Appeal In The Collections Of Chinese Famnille Rase Porcelain And Of Chelsea Red Anchor Porcelain. It An Article By Our Art Critic On The Permanent Collection At Temple Newsam Appears On Page 7.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS52121294/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=4019d9e2,,
Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1900-Jun-15,"London, England","Art Exhibitions. Mainly For The Benefit Of Those Large Numbers Of People Who Come To London For The Summer Season Only, Messrs. Agnew Have Decided To Exhibit Once More Their Famous Fragonards From Grasse, Which Were Shown For A Short Time In The Winter Of 1898. We Then Described Them At Length, And Told The Story Of This Roman Damour De La Jeunesse And At Present We Need Do No More Than Say That This Extraordinary Series, Perhaps The Masterpiece Of French Decorative Art Of The 18Th Century, May Now Be Seen Once More For A Short Time Before The Pictures Take Their Departure To Their Permanent Home, And That Mr. Claude Phillipss Pamphlet Will Tell The Visitor All That Can Be Learnt About Them. A Special Interest Will Attach To Them Just Now, Because In Little More Than A Week We Shall Be Able To Compare Them With The Treasures Of French Art At Hertford-House, Which Are About To Be Thrown Open To A Nation That Has Waited Long. There We Shall See Two Or Three Of The Most Famous Small Fragonards In The World, While Here In Bond-Street Is The Artists Chief Series Of Decorative Paintings. For Ourselves, We Have Our Doubts Whether The Pale Rose-Colour Against Which They Are Now Set Is Quite The Right Tone To Bring Out The Qualities Of The Pictures. They Would, Look Better Against White Wood Panelling, Or Oak Of The Natural Colour, Picked Out With Gilding. Some Fine French Pictures Are On View At Messrs. Artel Tooths Gallery In Bond-Street, Borrowed From Ind Owners By A Society Calling Itself The French Friends Of England. The Only Name Which Appears In Connexion With This Society Is. That Of An Artist, M. De Laubinjure, But We Believe That He Has Really Induced A Number Of French People Living In England To Declare Themselves, At The Present Crisis, In Favour Of The Country Which Gives Them A Home. It Is Not Surprising That Various Royal And Other Distinguished Persons Should Have Expressed Themselves Well Disposed Towards A Society Which Has So Good An Object. Quite Independently, However, Of The Direct Object Of The Exhibition, The Pictures Are Very Well Worth Seeing. They Are Mostly Of The Barbizon School, And Are Chiefly Lent From Two Or Three Of The Choicest Collections In England And It Is Certain That They Make A Finer Show Than Is Made By The Corot Room In The Paris Exhibition. There Is No Corot There Equal To Le Lac, Or The Smaller Picture Which Is Known As The Bent Tree Nor Is There A Diaz So Poetical As The Splendid Sketch Called Lorage. Half A Dozen Other Pictures By The Former Master Are Only One Degree Less Excellent Moreover, There Is An Excellent Troyan, With Several Very Choice Examples Of Daubigny, The Simplest, Least Mannered, And, To Many People, The Most Attractive Of All This Group Of Painters, Especially From His Preference For Quiet River Views Seen From The Banks Of The Oise. One Good Picture By M. De Laubiniere Is In The Same Room, And Upstairs Are A Few More, With Several By Maurice Lb Vis, A Modem Follower Of The Barbizon Men. Further Up Bond-Street, The Rooms Of The Fine Art Society Are Peculiarly Attractive Just Now. The Chief Strength Of The Display Lies In The Magnificent Ruston Collection Of Turners Watercolour Drawings, Lent By Mr. And Mrs. Arthur Severn, To Whom They Were Bequeatheda Collection Well Known To All Devotees Of Turner, And Well Remembered By The Older Generation From Its Having Been Seen Here In 1878. Against These It Is A Little Difficult For Any Landscape Painter In Water-Colours To Hold His Own, But None The Less One Can Very Well Enjoy Such A Collection As That Which Mr. El. L. Norris Has Brought Together In The Next Room, Representing His Work In Wiltshire, Berkshire, And The Midland Counties. Mr. Norriss Methods Are Not Those Of Turnerbe Uses, For Example, A Great Deal Of Body-Colour But He Could Quote Many Sound Authorities Among Modern Men. Such Drawings As Those Called Ragwort 27A Big Yellow Field Iris 56, The Orchard Gate 60, And The Grave Little River Scene Called Coombe Bissett 28 Are Among The Most Attractive Works In An Exhibition Which Is Generally Noteworthy For The Faithful Study Of Nature Which It Reveals. In The Next Room Are Some Drawings Of An Entirely Different And Much More Exceptional Kindthe Curious Water-Colours And Etchings By Maurice And. Edward Detmold, Who, We Believe, Are Twin Brothers, Boys Of 17. Once Before We Hare Noticed One Or Two Of Their Very Powerful Etchings Of Birds Let Us Add That In Their Drawings Also, Whether Of Birds On The Wing, Of Fish, Or Of Beasts Of Prey, These Young Artists Show A Very Nnngnal Knowledge Of Form, Together With A Gift For Design Which Promises Great Things, If Only They Take No Harm From Being Brought Before Th World Too Early. The Flying Lapwing, The Drawing Called A Duel In The Air, And Various Studies Of Tigers And Jaguars Are Of Surprising Excellence. Two Other Exhibitions In Bond-Street Are Worth A Visit. A New Firm, Messrs. Forbes And Paterson, Have Opened A Pleasant Little Gallery At No. 5, Old Bond-Street, And Have Hung It With A Rather Choice Loan Collection Of Pictures Of Early English Portraits. There Is A Charming Gainsborough Of Two Peasant Boys, Lent By The Duke Of Newcastle, A Good Reynolds, A Romney Of Considerable Charm, Some Excellent Raeburns,, A Picture Of Two Small Boys Painted By Sir Thomas Lawrence In Emulation Of Rubens, And A Very Charming Work Of Opies, Paintedbeforehe Had Become Mannered, And Black In The Shadows. Had The Cornish Genius Continued To Do As Good Things As This Mrs. Arkwright, He Would Have Ranked Very Near His Master, Sir Joshua.Messrs. Dowdeewell Have Brought Together Some Capital Italian And Dutch Pictures, Together With A Fine Portrait From The Peel Sale By Dobson, The English Painter Whose Talent Was Transformed By Vandyck Into An Almost Wholly Flemish Character. The Signed Triptych By The Interesting North Italian Painter Macrino Dalba Is The Most Important Of The Italians Here But There Are A Few Small Pictures Of The Umbrian And Venetian Schools Which Are Worth Study. Among The Dutch A Small Presentation In The Temple, By Eekhout, Shows How Near To Rembrandt The Best Of His Pupils Sometimes Earns.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS117892815/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=6d3a0e2c,,

Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1927-Mar-04,"London, England","Art. Exieeibitions. Beaux Arts Gallery. A Goou Many Or Tne Modem Flower Paintings By Eminentartists At The Beaux Arts Gallery Are Not More Than Records More Or Jess. Well Composed And Executed Of Intrinsically Beautiful Things, But Every Now And Then You Come Upon Something In Which Flowers, Medium, And Artist Have Eonspired .To Form A New Kind Of Beauty. The Most Striking Instance Is Flowers In A Glass Pickle Jar, By Mrs. Winifred Nicholson, Which Is Like A Startled Cry Of Delight In Humdrum Conversation. At Present The Powers Of Thts. Interesting Artist Do Not Go Farther Than The Deft Placing Of Patches -If Pure Colouir Of Creamy Quality Along The Lines Of Her Feeling, So To Speak, But When She Has Learnt To Subdue Solid Objects To Her Mood She Should Paint Very Good Pictures Indeed. She Is Rather Like A Natural Melodist Who Has Yet To Learn The Rules Of Hatniony. A Special Feature Of The Exhibition Is A Group Of Works In Oil And Pastel By Miss Beatrice How. These Have Charm Of Arrangement, Colour, And Surface Quality, But They Rely On The Whispered Statement Of Natural Beauty Rather Than On Its Transformation. Bat Stocks And Marigolds Is A Choice Effect Of Colour. Fron The Other Pictures-There Are 61 In All Chrysanthemums In White Vase, By Mr. R. Mann Livens, Decoration, By Mr. Baker Clack, Narcissi Daffodils, And Wallflowers In A Glass Jampot, By M4R. James Iiill, And Summer Flowers, By Miss Liatherine Clausen, Nmay Be Picked Out As Best Responding To The Cry Raised By Mrs. Nicholson. At The Same Gallery There Are Paintings And Water-Colours By Mr. J. F. M. Floyd. Hle Presents The Engaging Spectacle Of A Vian Who Has Discoverea That Nature Is Not Art. Hle Has Yet To Leain To Organize His Discovery,.But He Is Followiig The Clue, And In One Picture At Least, A Charm, In Which Blue Interspaces Of Sky Have, As It Were, Taken The Tip From The Gestures Cf .A Flame-Like Yellowv Tree, An Act Of Magic Is Performed. At Ptesent Mr. Floyd, Escited By His Discovery, Tries To Say Too Muchincluding Some Romantic Balderdash-In The Same Picture, But A Charm, Spring Landscape, Backs Axid Shanties, And Rock Garden Establish His Right To Be Called An Artist. Sunny Gardens. The Alternatives For The Artist In Such Pictures As The Water-Colours Of Sunny Gardens, By 31Iss Edith H. Adie, At The Halcyon Club, 13 Cork-Street, Are To Sacrifice The Individual Iliovers To The Landscape Sutroundings Or To Tame The Landscape Into Behaving Like The Flowers-That Is To Say, When The Aim Does Not! Go Farther Than Representation. Miss Adie Has! Closenl The Latter Alternstive And !Ulflued It I With Charm Of Colour And Neatness Of Execution. I Preference Among Such Pictures Will Depend A Great Deal On The Stibject Itself-Which Garden, Or Part Of A Garden, Is Prettiest-But The Blue Border, Wistaria Pergola, Rhododendrons, Orange Trees, Bogliaco, And The Thames At Kewv May Be Quoted As Good Examples. The Exhibition Is Open Until I Mlarch 13, Admission Being By Visiting Card. Walkers Galleries. The Oil And Water-Colour Paintings Of Assisi, Yplies, And Other Subjects By Miss B. E. Lithiby At Walkers Galleries, 118. New Bond-Street, Are Distinguished By A Remarkable Firnmness Of Statement In Subjectsv-Hichlaregenerallytreated In The Melting Mood. Not That Miss Lithibys Vork Is Deficient In Feeling, But That The Feeling Is Expressed On A Steady Note, Instead Of Witli The Treinolo That Many Artists Think Necessary When They. Are In A Plicc Wvitlh Associations, Such As Venice Or Assisi. St. Claras Cboir In San Damiano, Assisi, To Name One Of The Best Of The Water-Cblours, Gains Rather Than Loses In Emotional Effect By Being Ostensibly A Still-Life I Study In The Modern Manner Wvith The Emphasis Put Upon, The Plastics Of A Receding. Choirstall, A Book-Rest, And A Doorway. It Is Not Only A Flne Drawving, But A Flne Piece Of Con- Tained Sentiment, And Mliss Lithiby Has Got So I Much. Out Of The Bare Essentials In This Instance Thlt One Almost Resents The Shadow Of The Tuonk In Interior Of San Danmano, Assisi, Tlohigh It-Happens Quite Naturally, As A Concession To The Weaker Folk Who Must Have Sentiment Underlinled. When Occasion Offers. As In The Wet-Lashed Impression Of A Cross In A Rain Squall, On The Somtne, 1910, Miss Lithiby Is Not At All Afraid To Yield To Itwhich Is Proof Rather Than Otherwise Of Her Freedom From Sentimentalitv. Wood-Engraving8. The Wood-Engravings By Amr. Eric Daglish Anld Mfiss Flare Leighton At Tlle Redferli Gallery, 27. Old Bond-Street, Are Good Extanples Of The Unaffected Practice Of An Art Which, Since Its Revival, Is Not Yet Quite Free Iu Most Hands From Tle Artiness Which Hanigs Round Revivals. Both Artists Are Primarily Illustrators. And Possibly That Saves Theni From The Usual Defects By Keepilg Their Nminds Off Aesthetics. As Designers They Are Both Workmna Like Rather Than Inspired, Mr. Daglish Designing Chiefly In Wlhite On Black And Misc Leigliton In Black On Wvhite. It His Designs Of Birds, Beasts, And Fislhes, Not To Speak Of Insects, Mr. Daglisb Began And Continues With The Interests Of A Naturalist, And His Proglrss As An Artist Consists In The Better Reconciliatiou Of Those Interests With The Claims Of Page Decoration By Skilful Patterning. Castles And Cathedralm. English Cathedrals, By Mr Cecil Aldin, And Castles Of England. By Mr. Herbert J. Finn, Make Ul A Happily Inspired Exhibition At The Abbey Gallery. 2, Victoria-Street, Though It Is Of Topographical Rather Than Artistic Interest. Mr. Aldin. Wtho Works In Coloured Crayon, Has The Slicker Band In Picture Making. Being Adept In Suggesting An Olde Worlde Atmosphere. He Uses Figures Very Happily, And Seldom Fails To Give A Good General Idea Of The Cathedral In Relation To Its Surroundings. Salisbury Cathedral And Canterbury Cathedral Are Good Examples, And The Atmosphete Of Cathedral Towns Is Legitimately Showni In The Nocturnes Of Mlercery Lane, Canterbury And An Old English Inn. Mr. Aldins Share In The Exhibition Is Extended To Include Characteristic Drawvings Of Sporting Subjects. Mr. Finn, Who Is A Watercolourist, Has Tackled His Castles At Closer Quarters, Botli In Fact And In Spiirit, Being Obviously Interested In The Features Of Construction.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS202579044/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=166c1a1a,,

There Are About 200 Examples, Besides Wvork In Portfolios, Representing A Great Many Schools. The Credit For The Idea Of Giving Children, Not Necessarily Gifted, The Opportunity To Make Pictures In Their Own Way Under Sympathetic Direction Belongs To Miss Marion Richardson, Of The Dudley High School, And A Good Many Pupils Of That Institution Are Among The Exhibitqrs. Wvhat Strikes One More Than Anything In Looking Round The Exhibition Is That, Left To Themselves, Children Produce The Kind Of Picture That Is In The Air. This Does Not Necessarily Mean Tllat They Studv The Avork Of Contemporary Artists It Is Something Much Subtler Than That-A Characteristic Tendency In Surroundings Which Is Reflected In Cqntemporary Art.. A Child Surrounded By Motorcars, Aeroplanes, And Modern Industrial Buildings Is Likely To Drawv More Like Picasso Than Like Burne-Joues-To Whom The Characteristic Pictures Of A Former Generation Of Children Might Be Referred. More Significant And Encouraging Than The Kind Of Composition Produced By Children At The Present Day Is The Direct And Whole-Fisted Manner Of Execution. Wliat The Child Conceives Is, Under The Sympathetic Direction Referred To, Set Down With Complete Conviction In Terms Of The Implement Employed. It Is All Straiglht From The Shoulder, Without Any Of The Cramping Of Style That Drawing Lessons Gf The Conventional Sort, Or Undue Insistence Upon Merely Optical Observation, So Often Produce. The Best Compiment To The Exhibition Is To Say That It Shows The Carrying Fonvard, With Increasing Expression And Essential Truth, To The Age Of 16 Or 17 The Characteristics That Delight Us In Thle Drawings Of Infants. The Children Are Growing Up And Gaining Control, But They Are Not Losing The Synthetic -If The Word Must Be Used-Character With Which They Started. This Is Not An Exhibition For Detailed Description, But Special Attention May Be Called To Jonahl 17, Family In A Tramn 44, Saucy Bill 55, The Arrival 96, Tower Bridge 00, Last Supper 103, Hide And Seek 121, The Flower Seller 134, And Haymakers 155.

Miss Frances Hodgkins, Who Exhibits Paintings And Water-Colours At The Claridge Gallery. 52, Brook-Street, Is An Original Artist With What Looks At First Sighit A Tendency To Caricature. Continted Acquaintance Wit-H Her Work, However, Shows That This Is Due To Her Anxiety To Give Pictorial, Form To Signific.Ant Movements, Momentary Expressions, And Paswing Effects Of Light And Colour. In Her Own Way, She, Too, Like Cezanne, Is Engaged Il Trying To Make Of Impressionism Something Like The Old Masters. It Is Eatsy Enough To Set Down A Momentary Impression In Vague Terms, -But To Keep The Impression Lively And At T,He Same Time Make The Picture Enduriur In Its Appeal Needs Consideration And A Good Many Compromises In The Appearance Of Things.

Her Oil Paintings Show An Interesting Development From Comparatively Hard Outlines Andl Realistie Modelling Towards A More Exclusive Dependence On Colour Values, With Very Good Results In Fisher Boys, Girl With Guitar, And The Two Still Life Paintinas.

And Shrine Of St. Peter As Best Representing An Art Wlhich Is Full Of Life. At The Same Gallery There Is A Very Exciting Collection Of Drawings And Designs By Children Trained Under Miss Marion Richardson At Dudley High School And By Her Pupils At Other Schools. The General Aim Is To Get Children To Put Down Their Irental Images From Observed Or Suggested Subjects, Irrespective Of Whether They Are Like Nature In The Conventional Sense. Tuition Takes The Form Of An Elastic Control, Limited- To Suggestionis For Unprovement And Hints In Design From The Old Masters. The -Results Are Astonishing. It Is Quite Clear That Most Children Form Conceptions-As Distinct -From Mere Arrangements-Of What They Have Seen, And That If They Can Be Encouraged To Put Them Down On Paper In A Whole-Fisted Way We Get Something Much Better Than Copies Of Nature. - Artistic Talent, Of - Course, Happens Where It Will, But These Drawings Seem To Show That It Might Happen More Frequently If Grown-Ups Did Not Interfere With Wrong Methods. The Shopping Subject From The Dudley High School, Flower Paintings From Benenden School, Snow Scene From Westminster School, Theatre Audiences From Westminster City School, Emotional Landscape From Langford Place, And Diaper Designsprinted From Potato Or Hino Blocks Cut By The Children-From - Hayes Court Are Instances In Support.

For The Most Part The Artists, Who Include Sir Muirhead Bone And Mr. Eric Ravilious, For Familiar Names, Have Drawn Their Inspiration From The Life And Work Of The People, So That The Exhibition Has General As Well As Artistic Interest. It Is Intended That The Exhibition Should Tour The Country By Arrangement With Local Trade-Union Branches, Cooperative Societies And Settlements, For Showing In Their Halls As Ell As In Galleries. As An Attempt To Put Back The Artist Where He Belongs, In Direct Contact With The Mass Of The People, The Enterprise Deserves Every Encouragement, And The Quality Of The First Exhibition Shows That No Lowering Of Standards Is Contemplated. From The Nature Of The Case Lithographs Are Both Most In Evidence And, On The Whole, Most To The Point Of The General Title. By Sir Muirhead Bone There Is A Series Illustrating Clydeside Industries. Mr. Hubert Cook, Who Is Himself A Welder, Deals With Welding In The Swindon Railway Works In Dramatic Designs Of High Lithographic Quality. Great North Road-Approaching London, By Night, By Mr. James Boswell, Waterlogged, By Mr. James Holland, Sheep Market, By Mr. T. E.

It Is Evident, However, That If Mr. Gerard Has Not Yet Decided What He Wants To Do He Is Preparing Himself For All Possibilities. There Is Nothing Desultory About His Work, But Each Subject Is Treated With Careful Regard To The Best Means For Its Realization. Of The Works In Oil African Soldier And The Two Blonde Landscapes, Les Oliviers And En Provence, Make The Best Impression.

Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1931-Jul-14,"London, England","Entertainments Art Exhibitions Auguste Rodin To Be Opened By The French Amubassador At 3 Oclock To-Day, There Is At The Leicester Galleries A Coniprehensive Exhibition, Including Drawings And Etchings, Of Works By The Late Auguste Rodin. By This Time Most Of The Uncertainties About Sculpture Which Confused The Appreciation Of Rodin Have Cleared Away. It Is Recognized That, So Long As They Are Kept Distinct, Both Modelling And Carving Have Their Place In Sculpture, And The General Aims Of The Post-Impressiomist Movement In Art Are Well Enough Understood To Make Evident The Artistic Value Of What Went Before. Rodin, Though Some Of His Works Were Translated Into Marble, Was Definitely A Modeller, Building Up His Figures In Clay For Casting In Bronze, With A Maximum Of Plastic Movement In A Rapid Sequence Of Planes. That He Is To Be Called An Lmnpressionist Might Be Disputed, But It Is Impossible To Look At The Play Of Light On The Bronzes In This Exhibition And Not See That He Was Iiiuch More Interested In Passing Effects Of Movemnent And Surface Expression Than In Form In T-He Abstract. At Any Rate, He Was A Naturalist, In Love With Life, And More Concerned With Character And Expression Than With The Effects We Call Monumental. He Responded To Both Classic And Gothic Influences, But What Strikes One Most Of All Is His Firm Basis In The French Tradition. Of Necessity Most Of The Works In The Exhibition Are Comparatively Small, But, Besides Portrait Busts, There Are Several Statues At Full Scale, Including Eve And L Age D Airain, The Male Figure Against Whicli Was Brought The Idiotic Chargeitself Significant Of Rodins Characteristic Powers-That It Had Been Cast From The Living Model. A Good Many Of The Works Will Be New To The English Public, And Several Have Only Recently Been Cast. In Bronze Firom Plasters Left By The Artist. The Directors Of The Leicester Galleries Are Certainly To Be Congratulated On Their Enterprise And Judgment In Providing Us This Opportunity To Study The Work Of The Man Who, Taking His Range Into Account, Remains The Greatest Sculptor Of Modern Times. Maillol Excels Him In Individual Works, But He Has Not Rodins Variety. As A Rule The Artistic Interest Of Rodins Works Is In Inverse Ratio To The Pretensions Of Their Titles. As Is Now Generally Known, He W-As Quick To Take, Suggestions About The Meaning Of His Work, And, Though He Was Deeply Learned In His Own Craft, He ,Was Not A Great Philosopher. Even The Famous Balzac -Shown Here On Ireduced Scale And In Head Studies, As Well As In An Interesting Preliminary Version 85-About Which Much Transcendental Stuff Has Been Written, Is Not So Much A Mystic Symbol Of Literary Gemius As A Very Ingenious And Skilful Attempt To Concentrate Attention On The Expression Of The Head. It Is Questionable If Rodin Ever Produced Anything More Perfectly Beautiful And Satisfying From A Plastic Point Of View Than The Small Group Of A Girl With A Child On Her Knees, Entitled Frere Et Sceur. It Is Harmonious From Every Point Of View, It Is Tender In Feeling, And It Sparkles Witli Life. Another Very Successful Composition Is The Group Of Two Figures, Le Bon G6Nie -Formerly Called Jeune Fille Confiant Son Secret A Isis -Full Of Movement, But Perfectly Contained Within The General Contour. Une Great Interest Of This Exhibition Is That It Shows Many Of The Works In Different Stages. The Several Studies For L Eternelle Idole May Be Quoted, No. 51 Being Particularly Charming. Rodins First Known Work, A Portrait Head Of His Father, Jean Baptiste Rodin, Made In 1860, Is Here, And Thera Are Portrait Busts Of Georges Clemenceau, Bernard Shaw, And Marcelin Berthelot -Whi Is Regarded As One Of The Finest Of Rodins Men Subjects. Les Bouraeois De Calais, Of Which The Replica Is Familiar At Westininster, Is Shown In Little. There Is An Interesting Collection Of Drawvings-Made Rapidly In Pencil And Wash As The Model Moved About The Studio. At A Time When Carved Sculpture Is In The Ascendant, And The Emphasis Is Tlirown Upon Moniumental Character, It Is Well To Be Reminded That There Is Another Form Of The Art, Deriving Directly From Life, And That It Was Employed By Rodin With A Resource And A Variety Of Expression Which Have Not Since Been Equalled.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS202056942/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=e4890a67,,

There Ame A Few Eighteenth And Nineteenth Century Works By Topographical Artists, But Most Of The 150 Paintings, Drawings, And Sculptures Are By Artists Who Have Been Fully Conscious Of Recent Movements In Europe Although Many Artists Have Applied French And Other Styles To African Subects, It Is Admitted That As Yet There Is Nothing Approaching A South African School. A General Impression Of Thc Exhibition Suggests An Adventurous Struggle For Freedom Not Unlike That Of A Nurnber Of English Artists When Postimprcssionism Was First Discovered Here One May Well Believe That To Paint Pictures Which Would Not Be Out Of Place In The London Group Required Great Courage And Tenacity When Art, As Mr. Gcoffrey Long Says In His Preface To The Catalogue, Was Largely Represented By Views Of The Mountains Of Cape Province Lit By The Last Sunset Of Victorian Bad Taste And Funereally Framed In Dcad Black. One Or Two Of The Artists Here Would Normally Be Considered Members Of The English School There Is. For Example, Graham Bells Ithe Cafe, From The Manchester Art Gallery, And Mr. Du Plessis Shows A Number Of Characteristic Landscape And Still-Life Paintings.

C6Onaghis, 144, New B13Ond-Street, A Very Captivating Loan Exhibition Of Paintings And Drawings By Francesco Guardi 1712-93. More Free In Style Than His Master Canaletto, More, Atmospheric In His Treatment Of Venice, And A More Varied Colourist, Guardi Sums Up To Perfection The Most Attraetive Qualities Of The Baroque Phase Of Painting. His Pictures Are Set To Music, And One Effect Of This Exhibition Is, To Evoke The Illusion Of Somebody Playing Searlatti. Apart From His Power Of Musical Composition, Eontrasting The Movement Of Shipping And People With The Stability Of Architecture, With A Use Of Accents That Might Be Compared To Trills And Turns, Guardi Was One Of The Liveliest Painters In Aetual Execution That Over Lived, With. A Touch That Wvas At The Same Time Firm Arnd Sensitive. In His Treatment Of The Figure On A Small Scale L He Has Some Affinities With Hogarth, Buti The Grace Of Movement Is All His Own. The Baroque Tendency Of His Art Is Most Pronounced In The Large Composition -Almost Certainly Invented-Entitled Seascape. It Is Full Of Echoes And Responses In Form And Colour, The Themae Being Given Out, So To Speak, By The Swinging Sea Wall Below The Tower, Upon Which Slanting Shadows Carry On The Movemnent Until It Is Caught And Returned By The Lateen Sail Of A Boat. A Red-Cloaked Figure In The Foreground States The Strongest Colour, Which Is Echoed In Pink Flags, And, On The Left, A Blue And A Brown Figure Are Emphatically Relieved Upon The Sunset. But This Is A Full-Blooded Exercise, A Little Garlicky In Flavour, And The Graces And Refinements Of Guardi Are To Be Looked For Elsewhere. Three Pictures, In. Particular, Show His Delicate Mastery Of The Figure-In Each Case On A Different Scale And In Different Relations. The Figures Are Smallest In The Piazzetta, And Presented Singly Or In Little Groups, Forming A Series Of Trills And Runs In A Composition That Is Primarily Arehitectural-Suffering A Little As A Composition From The Duality Ereated By The Two Columns. Pius Vi. Blessing A Crowvd In Front Of The Scuola Di San Marco, Which Is Very Likrely To Be One Of The Four Pictures Commissioned By. An Englishman In 1782, Shows Guardis Power To Niake That Most Difficult Compromise Between A Crowd And A Collection Of Individuals--The Foreground Figures Nmight Be Portraits-And Also The Amount Of Colour He Could Suggest In Nomninl Grev. In The Ridotto. An Interior, He Breaks Into Positive Colour, The Scheme Being Arranged To Celebrate The Glorious Blue Domino Worn By The Central Figure. The Effect Of Slow, Swaving Moventent. In This Picture Is Wonderful. A Continuous Rhythm Runs Through The Whole Group? Of Fliures--Some Paradintg In Conversaton, Others Seated At Refreshment Or Games Of Chance-While Individual Pairs Contribute Minor Rhythms Of Their Own. The Most Elaborate Piece Of Formal Counterpoint Is The Riva, With Buildings P4Tllel To The Spectator And, In Front Of Thern, A Very Intrieate Arrangement Tf Ahippinlg, Witht Raking Masts And Calrving Ropes-A Fugal Composition. The Island Of San Giorgio Mlageiore, The Redentorc, Church Of Santa Maria Della Salute, End Dogana Di Mare Show More Partieularly Guardis Atmospheric Qualities, Airy Perspeetives Of Siffsed Colour, Crossed By Dark Gondolas, With Sparkling Accents Where The Oars Sttike The Water.

Tho Two Artists Differed In Inspiration, And Mcevoy Was Contemporary And A Good Draughtsman, Whereas Conder Died Some Years L Ago And Never Learnt To Draw, But For All That They Had In Common The Preoccupation Lvith The Sensuous Qualities Of Painting To The Disregard Of Construction Which Seems To Have Passed Away. 3Mcevoy Had The Nmore General Sense Of Beauty, And, Though His Drawing Was Loose Enouglh, It Was There By Implication. Though This Exhibition Contains Three Oil Paintings The Artistic Interest Is Rather Vith The Water-Colours, Particularly Those Of A Moderate Size, Such As Lillah, Bmr. Noel Cowvard, Study For In A 31Irror, And Boats In Dieppe Harbour. In Their Vaourish Treatinent, With Sharp Accents Where Required, And Fluent Handling In Subduede Colouts They Have A Great Deal Of Charm--Even If They Seem To Evade Rather Than Master Their Subjects. Conder, Though Lie Paintted Some Landscapes, Was Almost Entirely Erotic In His Inspiration, And His Work, With Its Great Inequality, Is A Very Good Illustration Of Hoiw Far Such Inspiration Is Adequate For A Work Of Art. As A Rule The Quality Of His Work Is In Inverse Ratio To Its Size, And It Is Questionable If The Best. Things In This Exhibitioni Are Not The Very Smlall Watercolours On Silk, Bathing Machine And In The Park. Conder Was Not A Great Artist, But He Was A Very Precious Little One, And Lie Is Historically Interesting As Tho Distiller Inito Colour Of That Queer Phase Of Life Wvhichi Is Conveniently Called The Decadence. At The Same Gallery There Are Paintings And Water-Colours By An American Artist, Mrs. Louise Nvood Wright. These, Again, Atre Artistic By Evasion Rather Than! By Mastery, And The Best Pictures In The Exhibitioni Are The Slighlt Grey Portraits Of Mrs. Herbert Brocknian And Mrs. Low, And The Still Life Painting Of Roses In The Windowv, Which Is Charming Both In Colour And In Play Of Light. With More Positive Colours Mlrs. Wright Seems To Lose Her Taste, Though Autumn Flowers, In Water-Colour, Is A Good Study.

On1 These Lhies It Is A Very Attractive Exhibition Indeed, Collsistently Harmonious In Colour And Graceful In Pattern. Spealing Generally, The Work Basedl On The Earlier Periods, Suci As The Bess Bed Hangings Worked In Blue Wools On Linen, From Designs At Hardwick Hall, Is The Mlost Pleasing, But The Charmns Of Colour And Workmanship Persist Down To The I Vic- Torianisms. For Soiie Reason The Most I Nmodern Note In The Exhibition Is Strtek By The Florence Bed Hangings, In Silks On Canvas-An Extremely Vell-Balanced Adapta- I Rion, In Both Form And Colour, Of The Florentine Fiordilice. Samnlers And Patchlwork Quilts, Old And Modern, Are Inchlded In The Exhibitioi. I The Flower Paintings By Mis Marion0 Broom At The Same Gallery Show The Artistic Value Of Excess. On Examination They Are Neitlher Well Drawvn Nor True In Tone Relations, But By Virtue Of Thieir Richness And Intensity They Succeed In Looking Handsome. Phlox And Scabious, Toby Jug, And Zinniiias 23 Are Three Good Examples. Miiss Ethel Sands Of The Many Contemporary Artists Who Would Acknowledge Their Indebtedness To Hlr.

The Art Of Mliss Sands Is Highly Civilized In Its Choice Of Subject Mnatter, Inclining To Elegant Interiors Wvhich Might Very Well Be The Settings Of Stories By Henry James. In These Interiors, Xvhich Are Either Panelled Or Else Prettily Diapered, Sunlight Is Graciously Received And Entertained With A Variety Of Objects-Floxvers, China, Glass, Ribbons, Whhat Not-And There Is A Great Deal Of Unobtrusive Art In Deciding Its Direction For The Benefit Of The Ilesigii. As A Rule Miss Sands Is Most Successfal Wvith Blte, Green, And Pale Gold, Thouglh A Lobster Is Ouie Of Her Best Pictures-Largely Owving To The Fact That The Red Is Centred In -Le Composition.

Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1924-Oct-11,"London, England","I Art Exhibitions. The London Group. To Anybody Who Wiu Give Himself A Chance With Pictures, Without Too Much Regard To His Own Prejudices, The Twentyfirst Exhibition Of The London Group At The Hinansard Gallery, 196, Tottenham Court-Road, Cannot Fail To Bring Ultimate Satisfaction.. It Is A Remarkably Consistent Exhibition, Comfortable And Even Cosy In General Atmosphere, Due In Great Part To A Prevailing Fatness Of Pigment And A Warming Up Without An Obvious Brightening Of Colour. There Is A Slight Disturbance At The Further End Of The Gallery, Caused By M. Riaoul Dufys Seascape, Seen Through A Window, Which, With Its Blare Of Light And Dancing Wavelets, Reminds You A Little Of The Concealed Spy In The Sack Who Tried To Pass Himself Off As Broken China By Exclaiming At The Critical Moment, Crash, Crash-Tinkle, Tinkle, Tinkle! And Mr. Matthew Smiths Wild And Whirlingnot To Say Sanguinary-Nudes. These Last Represent, No Doubt, A Genuine Impulse, But The Risk Is That When The Moodhas Passed, And The Bubble Is Pricked, So To Speak, Mr. Smith Wil Find That He Hias Learnt To Do Nothing Else Inside Its Exuberance. Having Paid Homage To These Demonstrations And To The Sailor, Nigger, And Lady Having A High Old Time In Mr. J. W. Powers Dance, We May Pass To Quieter Pleasures. For The Deft Use Of Paint To Enclose A Mood There Is Nothing To Equal Mr. Walter Sickerts Banco. Apart From Its Enchanting Colour Scheme Of Golden-Green, Violet-Blue, And Dull Red, And Discreet Suggestion. Of Conflicting Lights, It Conveys The Impression Of A Breathless Moment In Which The Painter, As Well As The Gamesters, Was Absorbed. It Has An Emotional As Well As A Pictorial Unity Which Raises It Far Above A Thing Seen. Mr. Roger Fry, Who In These Political Days Might Be Said To Play Extreme Left To Mkdr. Sickerts Asquithian Liberalism, Is For Once Non-Committal In A Horizontally Composed Beynac Of Quarry-Face, Trees, And Road. His Increasing Geniality Of Substance Is Carried By Others Of His Party Into A Beefiness Which Suggests That The Prevailing Influence Of The Moment Is That Of Segonzac. If The Play Upon A Respected Name May Be Permitted, Mr. F. J. Porter Has Something Of The Advertised Feeding Properties Of That Beverage. His The Mouth Of The Arun Is An Extraordinarily Good Picture, Holding The Day Like A Cup, But Even It Has Traces Of The Excessive Stoutness Of Pigment, Which Obscures The Very Real Merits Of Arundel And Lilac. In The Matter Of Substance, Something Seems To Be Needed Between Mr. Porters Practice And The Extreme Polish Of Mr. Mark Gertler. In His Ornamental Bird The Preciosity Is Justified, And In Head Of A Young Girl It Roughens To The Occasion But In Roses And Tapestry The Surface Does Not Support The Scale, Though The Picture Has All Mr. Gertlers Peculiar Magic Of Colour. As These Remarks Will Suggest, One Great Merit Of The Exhibition Is That Everything In It Is Contained Within The Province Of Painting. There Is Nothingor Hardly Anything-In Which A Doctrinaire Design Sticks Out Like Scaffolding. In Mr. Duncan Grants Still Life, The Forms-Of White Jug, Red Bowl, Black Bottle, And Green Apples-Hardly Earn Their Support On The Kitehen Table, But They Are Beautifully Placed And Well Notirished By Their Background, And His. Pot Of Flowers Shares With Miss V7Anessa Bells Roses And Apples, Not To Speak Of The Lustre Bowl, The Honours Of The Exhibition In Joy Of Colour. A Welcome Appearance, In This Connexion, Is That Of Miss Anne Estelle Rice With Flowers. Mr. Walter Taylor Breaks New Ground In Several Paintings Of Buildings, Exchanging Line For Pattern, And Mr. Ethelbert White In T Dolce Acqua, With A Thrusting Arch, And Several Of The More Prominent Landscape Painters, Such As Mr. Paul And Mr. John 1Ash And Mr. Elliott Seabrooke, Supply Excellent Drawing8. Drawings And Etchhings. Representing Mostly Sheds, Barns And Other Homely Buildings In Sussex And Kent, The Etchings And Drawings By Mr. Grahamn Sutherland At The Twenty-One Gallery, Durham House.Street, Adelphi, Make A Very Good Impression. Mr. Sutherland Is Clearly To-Be Added To The Now Considerable Body Of Young Artists Who, As If Reaeting From The Shorthand Methods Which Fill Our Galleries With Superficial Attractions, Return To Dwelling Upon Their Subjects And Aim At An Artistic Effect By Co-Ordinating Detail Rather Than By Leaving It Out. Apart From The Enduring Excellence Of The Results, The Movement Is Extremely Interesting Because It Is Paralleled In Other Aspects Of Life-In Social Matters.And In Architecture, For Instance. It Is A Defuiite Sign Of The Times-The Still, Small Voice After Too Much Of The Big Noise. The Most Accomplished Things By ?Mr. Sutherland Are Probably The Twvo Small Etchings, Fetching Wvater And October Landscape, And The Slightly Larger The Sluice Gate, In Which The Commonplace Material Of Posts And Rails Is Used With Admirable Effect In Both Pattern And Tone But Everything He Does Has The Distinction Which Comes Of Feeling Into The Subject. The Old Cow Barn, An Interior, And Niumber Fortynine, An Extremely Careful Drawing Of A Ruined Thatched Cottage, With The Rafters Showing, Are Two Of Several Works Remarkalle For The Way In Which Nominally Still- Ife Subjects Are Made To Suggest Local Atmosphere. The Making Of Colour Prints. At The Gallery Of Messrs. Bromhead, Cutts, And C6., 18, Cork-Street, Biurlington-Gardens There. Is Ai Very Interesting Special Exlhibition, Organized By The Society Of Graver-Printers In Colour, Showing The Various Stages In The Pro. Diietion Of Eolour Rints From Wood And Metal. The Exhibition Consists Of Preliminary Drawings, Trial Proofs, Final Proofs, Variations In Printing, And A Few Wood Blocks, And The Net Result Is To Impress The Observer, Not-Only With The Way In Which The Artistic Imtention Of The Final State Is Kept In View Throughout, But Also With The Pare T4Aken And The Sacrifices Made In The Process. It Is Questionable If The Variations In Printingthat Is To Say, Different Colour Schemes From The Same Set Of Blocks Or Plates- Are Much To The Point, And Some Of The Preliminary Drawings Might Have Been Taken As Read The Particular Interest Of The Show Is In The Detailed Analysis Of The Final Result. From This Point Of View, The Most Infor Exhibit Is The Set, Consisting Of The Final - Proof With Six Preceding States Of Coloured Aquatint- For Sun Through A Yellow Mist, Chel. Sea, By Mr. Raphael Roussel The Special Interest Of The Set For The Wood Engraving Of St. Pauls, By Mr. E.

The Leicester Galleries English Landscape Paintings Describes More Than The Subjects Of The Pictures By Mr. Algernon Talmage, A.R.A., At The Leicester Galleries, Because, In Both Outlook And Method, He Is One Of The Most English Painters We Bave. He Takes A Broad, Sane View Of Country Life, With A Special Interest In Cattle And Horses, And A Masculine Sympathy For Human Beings In The Open Air Avoiding Alike The Extremes Of Brutality And Sentimentality. His Remote Ancestor Is Constable, But He Has Learnt Something From French Discipline, And Is Not Insensible To The Poetry Of Corot. Always A Painter In The Strict Sense Of The Word, As One Who Fulfils The Requirements Of Drawing, Colour, Tone, And Quality With Every Stroke Of The Brush, Mr. Talmage Goes On Making Progress In Composition, Unity Of General Tone, And Geniality Of Colour. Not The Least Charm Of His Present Exhibition Is That Of The Colour Of Daysgold, Silver, Blue, Green, Or Grey, As The Ease May Be, With Effective Contrasts. As That Between The Setting Sun, Dedham, And A Breezy Morning. Almost Necessarily Mr. Talmage Is. Happiest In A M6Oderatc Size, When The Picture Grows Under His Brush To The Immediate Conception In His Mind Without Much Calculation. The Planning-Out Of A Large Canvas Still A Little Bothers Him. October Morning, With All. Its Merits In Feeling Anid Workmanship, Is Rather Leggy In Its Framework Of Tree Stems And Branches And Their Cast Shadows-And The Last Perplex Rather Than Aid The Eye In Leading It Through The Picture. The Best, Or, At Any Rate, The Most Unified, Of The Larger Pictures Is The Road To Higham, With A White Cow Lcading Her Darker Companions Towards The Spectator Along A Lane In Cool, Grey Shadow At Sunset. The Movement And The Muffled Tread Of The Beasts In The Dusty Roads Are Wonderfully Well Suggested. Better Still, However, Are The Smaller-Sized A Dedham Landscape, In A Steely Glitter, And The Drinking Pool, In Which The Rails And The Slanting Boughs Play A Valuable Part In Holding The Picture Together. Anmong The Small, Direct -Studies, Each-The Expression Of A Nmood, It Is Vcry Difficult To Choose But Nos. 57, 60, 67, 68, 84, 88, And 94 Deserve Special Attention. Mr. Gerald Aekermaun, Who Has The Next Room With Water-Colours, Is In The Healthy English Tradition, With Special Affinities With Cox And Tom Collier. His Drawing Is Not Substantial Enough For Such A Subject As Cley M.Iill, On That Scale, But Give Himn Open Country In Broken Weather, And He Leaves Little To Be Desired. In Several Drawings, Too, In Blarch, The Sheep Fold In February, A . Sunny Mlorning In Marcli, And All October Morning, For Examples, He Gets The Quality Of A Season. Steyning Clhalk Pit, In Shadow, Shows Him Very Successful In A Subject Out Of His Usual Run.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS135075482/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=01a265b8,,

Charing Crossroad, Where There Is An Exhibition Of Stencilling In Colour By The Curwen Press. The Process, Hvllich Is Best Suited To Small Editions, Is Not New, But By Intensive Cultivation Mr. Curwven Has Brought It To A High Stage Of Perfection. The Great Advantage Over Printed Colour On The Page Is In What Painters Call Quality -Richness Of Gradation And Broken Texture, With The Suggestion Of Light, At The Same Time Keeping Within The Page Convention. The Greatest Triumph Of The Press So Far Has Been In The Illustrations By Mir. E. Mcenight Kauffer To Elsie And The Child, By M1R. Ariiold Beunett, Published By Cassells, And It Is Interesting To Compare These Results With, Tihe Illustrations, Bv The Same Artist, Lo Herman Melvilles Beuito Cereno, From The Nonesuch Press, Which Were A Fir-T Attempt With The Process. For Freedom Of Style The Most Remarkable Exaample Is Experimental Subject, By M1Rs. Edna Clarke Hall, Taken From One Of Her Illustrations To Wuthering Heiglhts, Whicht No Publisher Has Yet Had The Enterprise To Secure. One Would Have Said That It, Was Just The Moment For A New Edition Of This Novel. Apart From Its Special Object The Exhibition Is Interesting From The Range Of Artists Represented-Mir. Albert Rutherston 3Mr. Paul Nash, Jacquier, M1R. Barnet Freetiman, And Mirs. Milarion Dorn Among Zhem. Incidentally, It Is Easy To See That The Stencil Process Is One To Be Controlled Bv Taste Rather Than By The Limitations Of The Medium. Arlington Gallery Though There Is Not Mucl Outnvard Resemblance, The Landscapes. Flov-Er Pieces, Portraits, And Stili1If6Stixies In Oil By Mr. Gerard Ceunis A Belgian Artist, At The Arlington Gallery, 22, Old Bond-Street- Rehind Ooe A Little Of Vian Gogh. That Is To Say, They Seem To Proceed From A Desire For Intensity Of Realization-Particularly In Colour And Light. In Certain Instances, Too. There Is Something Corresponding To The Writhing Technique Which Van Gogh Employed In His Eagerness For Vitality In The Objects Represented. On What May Be Called The Impressionist Side Mir. Ceunis Is A Good Artist, I His Colour, Though Bright, Is Generally Harmoniious, And His Pictures Are Full Of Light But His Drawinig Is Fussy Rather Than Expressive And His Designs Are Comparatively Commoniplace. By Far The Most Original Is The Cabin, An Amusinig Study Of A Rough Sea Crossing, In Wlichl Distortionis Are Effectively Employed To Intensify The Lurching Movement. . On The Whole, However, We Like Mr. Ceunis Best Iin His Flower Pieces Such As Chrysanthemums, Liiies. Tulips, And Copper Pot. Sun In Room Does Not Lose Any Of Its Effect By A Quieter Treatment Than That In Most Of The Other Paintings. A Spanish Artist Mlr. Santa--Marina, The Spanish Artist. Who Shows Paintings And Drawings At The Gieves Gallery, 22, Old Bond-Street., Wins Approval By The General Sentiment Of His Work Rather Than By His Technical Powers. Something Intimate And Slightly Melancholy In His Pictuies Gives Them An Appeal That Their Actual Designls Might Not Exercise. His Nationality Comes Out In The Fondness For Masses In Siihouette Which Has Distinguished Spanish Painting Since Velazquez, As Also In The Convenition, Used In The Painting Of Mmie. Pia De Diego, Of Setting The Portrait Of A Human Being In Emotional Rather Than Strictly Pictorial Relation To The Portrait Of A Town. The Most Completely Satisfying Paintinig In The Exhiibition Is, However, The Portrait Of Mlle. Sol Santamtarina, A Young Girl Seated Witlh Her Hair Ahout Her Shoulders. In This The Silhouette, With Its Balance And Couniterchange Of Light And Dark, Is Managed With Great Skill Anid Refinement, Reminding One Of Coello. The Turning Of The Hands Iniward On The Lap Contributes To The Enclosed Feeling Of The Whole Coinposition. Two Other Attractive Portraits Are Don Mliguel Ramos And Minme. Rene Pierre, The Last Being Remarkable For Grace Of Line And Subtlety In The Modelling Of The Figure Under The Blue Dress. There Are Some Good Decorative Landscapes Of Bruges, Versailles, And Elsewhere, Aiid Portrait Drawings. The Study In Pencil Of Mlle. Sol Santamarina. 8 Is Charming. .Mr. S. M. Litten Though He Works In Line Mir. S. M. Litten, Who Shows Drawings And Etchings At Messrs. Connells Gallery, 47, Old Bond-Street, Has A Primary Instinct Tor Tone-And Toiie In Its Emnotional Rather Than Its Constructive Function. He May Therefore, As A Matter Of Convenient Classification, Be Said To Belong To The School Of Rembrandt. This Relationship May Be Used To Excuse Him For Getting Tone Effects With Line, Becduse The Effects He Values, With Their Richness Of Texture And Indefiniteness Of Gradation, Would Not Coxie Out Vell In Aquatint, Or Even, In Mezzotint. Though It Is Iiot The Mode Of The Moment, This Kind Of Etching Justifies Itself As, Means To An End. From What Has Been Said It Almost Follows That, In Subject., Mir. Litten Leans To The Picturesque And The Atmospheric-The Rather Ramshackle Buildings Of Lolland And The Romantic Light Aiid Shade Of Venetian Canals, Particularly At Niglht.

Null,Exhibition Of Australian Art,The Times,1898-Apr-04,"London, England","Exhibitio-N Of Australian Art. From To-Day Till May 7 The Grafton Galleries Will Contain An Exhibition Of Unusual Interest. It Aims At Giving Au Adequate Representation Of Current Australian Art, And, As It Is Organized By The Trustees Of The National Art Gallery Of New Soutli Wvales, That Object Has Been Fairly Secured. Nearly 400 Pictures And Drawings, With A Few Pieces Of Sculpture, Form A Collection The Like Of Which The Colonies Have Never Sent Home Before For The Best Men Exhibit, And The Galleries Of Sydney And Melbourne Lend Many Of Their Most Characteristic Pictures. One Is Tempted To Assume, In A General Way, That Colonial Art Cannot Be Very Good That The Country Is Too Young, And That The Talents Of Its Sons Generally Find Other Outlets. But In Point Of Fact The Last Twenty Years Have Wrought A Great Change In Australia, And The Practice Of Art Has Thriven There, If Not Quite As Vigorously As In America, At Least As Vigorously As Has The Practice Of Literature. These Galleries Show It, And They Show Also That The Impuise, Or At Least The Mode Of Expression, Has To A Great Extent Come From Paris, Through English And Australian Teachers Who Had First Learned What The Paris Ateliers Had To Teach Them. Mr. Bernard Hall, Mr. Daplyn, And Some Other Teachers Are Instances Of This Their Work, With That Of Their Pupils. Shows The Traces Of It. In This Bright And Pleasant Display There Is Very Little That Recalls Anything English The Broad, Summary Treatment, The Firm And Yet Careful Drawin-, The Manner Of Laying On Paint Are In Origin French, Though They Have Become In A Measure Transformed By Transplantation. If There Is Any British Work To Which The Australian Pictures Bear A Clcse Resemblance, It Is That Produced By The Young Men Of Glasgow And We Know How Strongly French Influence Has Told On Them. Mir. Phillips Fox, For Example, The Painter Of A Charming Portrait Of A Child In A Quaint White Frock And Sun Bonnet 108, Might Almost Have Worked With Mlr. Guthrie, And The Australian Landscapists, In Spite Of The Brightness Of Their Climate, Have Much In Common With Their Cousins On The Banks Of The Clyde. Of The Landscape Painters The Most Noteworthy Are Mr. Arthur Streeton, M.Ir. David Davies, 3Fr. Lister-Lister, And Mr. Daplyn While Among The Painters Of Combined Figure And Landscape Mr. F. Mcubbin, Mir. Tom Roberts, And Mr. A. Lotureiro Attract By Reason Of A Certain Individuality And Force. Mlr. Streeton Claims Our Gratitude For Giving Us Impressions Of Landscape Which Seem To Be Distinctively Australian His 1 Hawkesburv River 62 And His Picture In The Inner Gallery 284, Albeit A Little Too Much Composed, Could Hardly Represent Anything In Any Other Latitude. M.R. Davies, On The Other Hand, In His Tranquil, Featureless Landscapes, Almost Suggests The Barbizon Tradition Filtering Lowvn Through Tho New English Art Club. Mlr. Li.Ister Paints On Too Large A Scale, And Does Not Avoid Some Approach To The Commonplace But Mir. Daplyns Carefull W Ork, If A Little Oldfashioned, Has All The Virtue Of Sincerity. Tlle Large Picture Of M.Rr. Micubbin 7-6 Bears The Quaint Title In The Wallaby Track Let The Unmlearned Note That The Wallaby Is A Small Rodent W,Tho Wvanders From Plaee To Place, With No Fixed Home, And Is Therefore A Kind Of Totem For Tramps, Two Of Whom, With The Usual Baby, Are Painted In This Clever And Rather Touching Picture. This Is Ono Of The Everyday Incidents Of Australian Life A Tragedy Of A More Heroic Cast Is The Death Of Burke, The Explorer 09, A Large, Well-Painted Pictulre By Miir. Loureiro Of Melbourne. Let Us Add Mr. T. Robertss Vivid And Extremely Clever Picture Of Bolting Sheep. 1A Break Away 40, Some Portraits Of Sir Henry Parkes And Other Eminences, By Mr. Julian Ashton And Others Some Heads Of Aborigines 143, By Mlr. B. E. Minns Some Clever Pencil Drawings By Mir. Lambert 238 And One Or Two Excellent Little Pictures By Mir.

Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1925-Sep-14,"London, England","Art Exhibitions. New Forest Group. The Excellent Aims Of The New Forest Group Of Artists, Now Exhibiting At The Mansard Galleries, 196, Tottenham Courtroad, May Be Described As To Bring Together Local Talent And To Improve The General Artistic Amenities Of A Rural District In Which There Are No Regular Art Exhibitions Or Reference Libraries, Few Facilities For Seeing Books Or Reproductions, And Little, If Any, Instruction In Design Or Crafts Available. London Has Been Chosen Because A London Exhibition Focuses Local Interest Most Effectively, And Also Because It Is Easier There To Get Into Touch With Those Interested In General Artistic Welfare. The Present Exhibition Concerns Itself With The Architectural Crafts, With Special Reference To Libraries. Naturally Enough, It Is Tentative Rather Than Explicit, And Naturally, Too,It Is A Little Self-Conscious. As Everybody Familiar With. Country Life .Aust Know, The Right Procedure Is Not To Impose A Culture, But To Find Out The Artistic And Intellectual Possibilities To Which The Neighbourhood Will Respond, And This Mheans Conscious Experiment. The Problem, Nowadays, Is Not So Much To Preserve As To Restore Social Health, So That The Artist, Has To Proceed Like The Doctor Exhibiting A Series Of Remedies. Sorne Will Succeed And Some Will Fail, Because They Do Not Suit The Patient. .As In The Case Of The Patient, Much May Be Learnt From Past Habit, And So The R Records Of Interesting Features Of The New Forest And District By Local Artists, The Maps Of Ancient Earthworks And Pottery Sites, And . The Careful Drawings Of Roman Pottery, At First Sight Irrelevant, Have A Definite Bearing On The Problem. A First Step To Local Culture Is To Recall The Locality In Its Facts And History. The Exhibition Gives Evidence Of Much More Consideration-And Wary Consideration-Than Appears On The Surface. The Backbone Is A Series Of Suggestions For Libraries, Public And Private, Architectural, Musical, Seafaring, School And College, Childrens, Village, And Even Prison. Lists Of Suitable Books, Chosen By An Advisory Council Of New Forest Residents, Are Given, Together With Contributions From The Various Crafts For The Furnishing And Decoration Of Libraries, All Of Local Production. Plans And Drawings Of Library Buildings, By Such Architects As Mr. Sidney Greenslade-The Designer Of The Welsh National Library, Aberysytwyth, Now Engaged Upon New Library Buildings At Exeter-Mr. Paul Phipps, Mrs. Cecil Porter, And Mr. A. L. Roberts, Are Shown, And There Are Stained-Glass Designs By Miss C. M. Lowndes-Including Her Suggestions For The Rearrangement Of 13Th-Century Glass In Salisbury Cathedral. The Exhibition Is More Remarkable For What Is Suggests Than For What It Provides In Detail, But Special Attention May Be Drawn To The Decorative Designs By Mrs. Maxwell Armfield, The Textiles By The Forest Looms, And The N1Etal-Work By The Misses Lisle. During The Exhibition There Will Be A Series Of Half-Hour Conferences, At No Extra Charge, On Subjects Connected With Its General Aims, The Speakers Including Lord Montagu Of Beaulieu, Mr. D. Plunket-Greene, Dame Ethel Sniyth, And Mr. A. S. Cooke, County Librarian, Kent. A Tri-Inational Exhibition. The Tri-National Art Exhibition Which Opens At The New Chenil Galleries, Chelsea, Early In October Promises To Be Interesting-Particularly With Regard To America, Which Divides The Field With England And France. Except For A Privately Organized Cxhibition, Which Reflected The Past Rather Than The Present, At The Grafton Galleries A Few Years Ago, And Occasional One-Man Shows, We Have Laked Opportunities In London Tosee What Is Being Done Across The Atlantic And Now We Are To Be Introduced To The Younger American Artists, Such As Glackens, Tucker, Davies, Sheeler, Weber, And Walt Kuhn. The Constitution Of The French Group Reads More Familiar, But There Will Be A Special Attraction In The Sculpture By Bourdelle, Maillol, And Brancusi. Among The English Exhibitors Will Be Mr. Augustus John, Mr. Ambrose Mcevoy, Mr. Glyn Philpot, Mr. Jacob Epstein, And Mr. Frank Dobson. The Idea Of The Enterprise Is Due To Mrs. F. H. Harriman, Of New York, And It Is Intended To Be An Annual -Event Playing Its Part In Proraoting Amicable Relations.

Mukul- Dey, -The Indian Artist Who Visited The Bagh Caves A Few Years Ago Is Of Thbe Opinion That The Paintings There Were Never Completely Finished, The Final Black Touches Used For Sucb Details As Hair And Eyebrows At Aianta Being Absent, And Certainly The Copies Would Seem To Support This. If It Be True, It Only Adds The Interest Of An Art, For Whatever Reaton, Out Off Suddenly To These Nmarvellous Renuain.. There Are Nine Panels At The British Museum, Seven Of Them Seeming To Run In A Continuous Series Like A Frieze. Unlike The Aianta Paintings, Which Are Connected With The Story Of Buddha, They Have For General Subjectt A Rausical Play, With Notables Arriving On Horses And Elephants. This, However, Is Not To Saythat They Arte Not Religious In Intention, The Mood Of Them Being That Of Solem.N Rejoicing. The Players, Or Dancers, To The Number Of About 16, Are In A Flowery Enclosure, And The Other Figures Are In Procession-Something After The Fashion Of Magtegnas Triumph Of Julius Casar. But No Western Paintings-Though The Afinity Here Is Greater Than That Between European And Chinese Art-Can Equial These In Grandeur. The Effect Of Slow, Massive Movements In The Elephants And Horses Is Overwhelihing And The Deep Colouring, Of Different Tones Of Indian Red, Ochre, -Dull Blue, And Green, Relieved With Azure On Pale Yellow In The Garments Of The Women, Makes The Musical Comparison Unavoidable.

Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1897-May-05,"London, England","Art Exhibitioons. There Can Be No Doubt That A Worthy Successor To Meissonier, As A Painter Of Headlong Battlescenes, Has Arisen In The Person Of M. Francois .Lameng, Whose Vive Lempereur ! Now On View At Messrs. Tooths Is Tho Most Brilliant Picture Of The Kind That We Have Seen Since 1807. The Subject Is Neys Final Chargo At Waterloo, When, At The Head Of A Nondescridt Body Of Whatever Cavalry He Could Collectcuirassiers, Lancers, Dragoons, Carabineers, The Survivors Of Ten Cther Ferocious Charges-He Dashed Forward Against The Square Formed By The 71St Highlanders. Such A Scene, Scarcely Possible In Modern War, Where The Magazine Rifle Has Taught Cavalry To Keep Their Distance, Gives A Magnificent Opportunity To The Military Painter. He Can Bring Together On One Canvas Cavalry And Infantry In The Death Grapple On The One Side, A Rushing, Tempestuous Wave Of Horsemen, And On The Other The Foot Soldiers Formed In Square, The Hard Immovable Rock Against Nvhich The Wave Is To Dash, To Break, And To Melt Away. This Is What M. Flameng Has Done In The Picture Before Us, A Work On Which He Has Been Assiduously Engaged For Several Years, And In The Painting Of Which Lie Has Had All The Assistance That The Chief Historical Authorities Of The Day And The Descendauts Of Some Of The Principal Combatants Could Give Him. A Brief Pamphlet By M. Henri Houssaye, The Leading French Writeronthe Waterloo Campaign, Explains The Exact Circumstancesof The Charge Andof The Struggleswhichpreceded It- The Close Of Thefourth Act Of The Epicdrama Of Waterloo. It Reminds Us How, Ufter The Capture Of La Haie Sainte, Ney Endeavoured With Eight Regiments Of Cavalry To Break The English Right Wving How He Delivered Ten Separate Attacks, Without Being Able To Make Any Impression On The Squares. And How At Last, Collecting From All Regiments About A Thousand Survivors, He Made This One Last Desperate Venture, Only To Fail As Before. Al. Flamengs Picture Explains Why, Given That Raoral Steadiness Which Has Always Marked Onr Troops, It Was Impossible That Ney Should Succeed, For The Mere Position Of The Highlanders-Behind A Sunk Road, And Protected By A Battery Of Guns, Svhich, Though Silent, Were None The Less An Obstacle To Cavalry-Was Such As Bo Aive An Enormoas Advantage To The Defenders, Ereshly Mored Up From The- Reserve. Lbut, Waiving All Questions Of History, We May Unre3Ervadfy Admire The Spirit, The Accuracy, The Vigour Of M. Flamengs Work, And The Great Sense -.F Pictorial Effect Which It Displays. We Have Aot Even Discovered Any Blunders In The Dress Or 3Quipment Of The Highlanders, Which Is Of Itself L Great Testimony To The Artist And, As For The Efench Soldiers, It Is Enough To Say That Neys ,Ostume Is Painted From That Which The Marshal Ictually Wore, Lent By His Grandson, The Present Prince De La Moskowa. A Like Attention To Debail Is Shown Throughout The Picture. In Other .Aspects It Closely Resembles Meissoniers Work, Ihough It Is In No Sense An Imitation And While Icarcely Inferior To Him In Draughtsmanship, H. Flameng Is Perhaps Better In Colour. This Is The Only Picture Whicb Is Likely To Xraw People Away From The Academy For None Of The Other Shows That Have Just Opened Are Of Much Importance. Miss Earl, At Messrs. Gravess Galleries In Pall-Mall, Exhibits A Number Of Caretul Likenesses Of Celebrated Dogs, And The Attractiveness Of The Display Is Increased By Four Of The Queens Landseers, Specially Lent From Osborne. A French Ladly, Madame Bries, Shows At The Same P Lace Some Clever Water-Colours But In These Days The People Wsho Can Paint As Well As This Are Legion. Lastly, The Fine Art Society In New Bvnd-Street Startle Their Old Clientrle By An Exhibition Of The Works Of M. Jan Van Beers.

Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1930-Oct-22,"London, England","Art Exhibitions Walkers Galleries Two Of The Present Exhibitors-Lady Humewilliams And Mrs. W. St. John Mildmay-At Wvalkers Galleries, I 1S, New Bond-Street, Have Covered Tho Same Grounid, In Several Instances Painted Tho Sainr Subjects, So That Their Work Atyords An Interesting Comparison In Temperament And Style. Lady Liume-Wvilliamnis Is The More Atmospheric In Her Interests Andpossibly For Thar, Reason-She Has The Better Sense Of Tho Picturo As A Wlhole, Blending Thinigs Together By Noting Their Relative Values In The Schome. Early Morning-Venice, Storm Elffect-Bellagio, And Clhilteau Gaillard Are Three Of The Most Successful Of Her Drawings. Mtrs. Mildmay Is More Positive In Statement, As Regards Both Form And Colour. Witlh The Result That Her Work Looks More Circumstantial And Less Unified. She Is At Her Best When The Colour Scheme Assists Unity, Its In A Provenq,Al Cafe, But Sunshine And Shadow-St. Paul, Clearing Up After Rlain-Normanidy, And Dent Du Mlidi All Give Pleasure By Their Vigour Of Representationi. In Another Room There Are Landscapes In Silk Needlework, By Mrs. Forrester Wood. Theso Inevitably Raise The Question Of The Relation Of Mieans To End-Wvhether It Is Worth While Spending Weeks, Possibly Montlhs, To Get An Efect Very Sirnilar To What Couild Be Done In Water-Colour In An Lhour Or Two. It Is True That The Effect Is Not Quite Tlhe Same The Sheen Of The Material Gives A Silvery Quality. And Its Linmitations In Range And Variety Of Colour Lend Organization To The Schemes. Certainly Mrs. Wood Is Remarkably Successful In Suggesting Atmiiospheric Planes Of Distance, And She Draws And Com1Poses Well. The Relation Of Means To End Ignored, Her Pictures Ars Very Attractive. Miary Duddys Grocery Shop Is Possibly The Best, But Ploughsussex Anid Keepers College-Invernessshiro Run It Very Close. On Its Own Lines Mrs. Woods Work Is Very Consistent. Claridge Gallery Different As They Are In Other Respects The Two Present Exhibitors At The Claridge Gallery, 52, Brook-Street., Mr. Conrad Ttrench And Mir. Adrian Kobnt Have It In Common That They Seemn To Have Coine To The Practice Of Painting With Minds Wvoll Prepared. Of Mr. Ifrench, In Particular, One Would Say That He Had Cultiva Ted The Habit Of Looking At Things Pictorially, And In Terms Of Whllat Miiust Be Called Moderni Design, Before He Had Mutchi Opportunity For Execution. He Has The Advantage In Novelty Of Subject-Muatter, Mlch Of His Work Haviutg Been Done In Jamaica. His Danger Would Appear To Be The Characteristically Moderni One Of Over-Calculation Of The Picture, And There Are Hints Here And Thern Of The Flilled-Iii Design Instead Of The Composition In Terms Of Painting, But It Is Clear That He Is Temperamentally Considerate, And A More Imipulsive Fusion Should Come With Experience. The Most Completely Uniiied Of Hiis Oil Paintings Is The Stmall Banana Grove Jamiaica, But Negro Boy, Still Life 6, Draughts, And Homnestead Are All Pictures Which Add To A Nice Consideration Of The Desigsn, The Charm Of Colour, And Of Deliberate Handling. Depart Des Cygnes, Though It, Is Not So Deftly Painted As The Others, Has A Special Appeal In Its Emotional Gesture. Movement, Again, Is The Attraction In The Excellent Watercolour Of A White Horse, Mr. Browvns Pride And These Two Pictures Support The Impression That Mr. Ffrench Has Reached A Stage In Painting Whenl He Canl Afford To Lose His Head A Little. Mr. Adrian Kient Leaves More To Chance, Anid Seemns To Get A More Robust Pleasure Out Of The Substanice Of His Pigment-His Actual Colour Being Kept Dowvn. Easily The Most Attractive Of His Pictures Is Elephanit Ballet. It Is A Genuinely Plastic Inveiitioii, Its Humour Being Derived From Bulk In Movement, And Not From Any Suggestion Of Conscious Fun In The Animals. Bears, Half-A-Dozen Of Them In A Wood, Is Not Quite So Good In Composition, But Like The Other Picture It Suggests That Mlr. Kent Has Discovered A New Kind Of Artistic Value In Animal Life. The Beasts Are Nmade To Appear Entirely Independent Of Humiianity And One With Their Surroundings, Distinguished From Trees For Artistic Purposes By The Power Of Movement. In Some Of His Landscapes, In The Front, Rapallo. For Instance, Mr. Kent Adventurec Into Brighter Colours, And It Is Clear From Hia Treatment Of Thie Foreground In The Picture Namiied That Lhe Knows Instinctively How To Keef Thenm In Their Place In The Picture. The Tent 1. The Better Versioni Of The Two, Riva Ogni Santi, Venice, And The Canal, Regents Park Are Other Paintings That Promise Well For The Future. Gam1E Birds In His Present Exhibition Of Water-Colours Of British Game Birds At The Galleries Of Messrs. Vicars Brothers, 12, Old Bond-Street, Mr. J. C. Harrison, Who Is V-Ery Well Known In This Kind Of Work, Seems To Be Adopting A More Forcible Style, Particularly In Landscape Surroundings. There Is A Gain In Support To The Pattern Of Birds Against The Sky-Mnost Of The Subjects Are Shown In Flight-But Some R Isk Of Crudeness In Colour. Mr. Harrison Makes The Necessary Compromises-Between Markings As Knowvn And As Seen, And Between Actual And Pictorial Movement-Very Well Indeed But Above All It Is As A Record Of Characteristic Flight In Diflerent Circumstances That His Work Is Interesting. The First Over. Partridges, A Chance In A Life Time. Geese, And White-Fronted Geese Pitching Strike Us As Three Of His Best Irawings, But No Doubt Sportsmiien Andd Naturalists Might Prefer Others. There Are 55 Drawings In The Exhibition. Illuminated Maunuscripts A First Word Is Duo To The Charming General Effect Of The Exhibition Of Illuminated Manuiscripts, Presentation Addresses, And Heraldic Emblems, Engrossed By Miss Dorothv Hutton, At The Threo Shields Gallery, 8, Holland-Street, Kensington. At Once A. Special Form Of Art Is Proclaimed, With A Vitality And Grace Of Its Own, Ajid Examination Of The Work Leaves No Doubt Thast The Iorm Is Justified At The Present Day. It Is Somethinlg Quite Distinct From Fine Printing, Wvith A Give And Take-A Sort Of Tempo Cubato In The Line-That Belongs To Writing Alone. And, Thougll Miss Hutton Is Evidentlty Learned In The Styles Of The Past, There Is No Effect Of Imitation Itn Either Seript Or Decor-Ations. Art, Thev Say, Is A Criticism Of Life And It Is Certainly True That Fine Writing Is A Criticism Of Literature Even More Severe Than That Of Cold Print. It Is Extremnely Interesting To See How Diffcrent Qualities Of Literature Have Affected Miss Huttons Style Of Writing Compare For Instance The Gravity Of The Beatitudes With The Playfulness Of Sumer Is I Cumen In And The Birds Carol Breaks Into Song. Presentation Adldress To H.1.I-I. Princess Louise Is A Romp Of Children, And In Wedding Service There Are Manty Happy Allusions. Keeping Her Balance In Design, 3Miss Hutton Seems To Respond To Every Suggestion In The Words She Writes And In The Occasion Her Work Commemorates. Beaux Arts Gallery Everything In The Exhibition Of Painting6 Of Spain And Morocco By Mr. James Kerrlawson At The Beaux Arts Gallery, Brutonplace, Bears The Mark Of A Cultivated Mind, Alive To The Implications Of The Subjects, A Reflective Habit, And A Flne Taste In Colour. Before He Puts A Scene Or Subject On Canvas Or Paper Mr. Kerr-Lawson Reduces It To Its Essentials In Form And Colour As They Appeal To H?Im, And If These Esrsentials Are Expressed As Simplified Realism, Rather Tlan Synthtii Cally, His Work Is Not Likely To Suffer In General Esteem On That Account. Almost Inevitably Fromii His Method His Designs, Though They Are Well Patterned, Havo A Certain Slackness, And Occasionally-As In Moorish Street Scene - One Feels That He Put In A Colour Because It Was There And He Liked It Rather Than Because It Was Relevant To The Secheme. The Small Fonda, With A White Inule Against White Walls, Strikes Us As The Best Of The Oil Paintings, But They Are All Well Considered And Refined In Execution, And Arch Of Titus And Study Of Devonshire Fishermen Are Tvo Out Of Several Excellent Water-Colours. The Other Exhibitor Is Mr. Francis William Sargant, Who Carved The Stone Panels For The Oakham School Chapel War Memnorial.

Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1899-Apr-18,"London, England","Art Exlibitioins. The Nejw English Art Club Is Scarcely So Interesting As Usual In Its 22Nd Exhibition, Now Being Held At The Dudley Gallery In Piccadilly. New Men And Women Of Talent Have Been Slow To Come Forward To Take The Place Of Those, Once So Active As Reformers, Who Have Been Adopted. And Silenced, By The Academy. We Miss, Also, Mir. C. E. Shannon, Wvho Has Twice Lately Contributed Portraits So Good As To Excite Much Curiosity Ss To His Nest Step He Sends Nothing, Which Is A Disappointment. Perhaps The Things Which Give Most Pleasure Are The Group Of Smali Drawings, In Chalk Or Water-Colour, Near The Entrance And Among These The Chief Are Three Which Are Not English At All, But An I Vited Cqntribution By The Illustrious German Veteran, Professor Von Mlenzel, To Whom The Catalogue Properly Assig,Ns His Newly-Conferred Title Of Eixcellency. Drawingsby D5Enzel Are So Rarely Seen In England, Or Anyvhere Outside The National Gallery In Berlin, That We Must Welcome The Opportunity Of Studying Even Small Examples Of The Man Who, As Du Maurier Used To Say, Is The Real Founder Of The Modem School Of Book Illustration And Of Black And White Drawing In General. His Three Studies In Blaek Chalk Are A Landscape, A Church Interior, And A Figure, The Laat A Study For The Picture In The Library, Masterly In Conception And In The Thorough Knowledge Of Form Which It Displays. The Best Comphlinent We Can Pay To Mliss E. M. Monsell, The Anthor Of The Little Drawing Called Hair-Brushing - 12, Which Hangs Close By, Is To Say That It Shows Strong Traces Of Menzels Influence, Though This Has Trickled Down Through So Many Channols During The Last.50 Years That The Young Artist Herself Is Doubtless Quite Unconscious Of It. Some Extremely Dexterous Work By Mr. Laurence Housman, A Few Notes By Mr. Brabazon, And A Portrait Group By Miiss L. Stillman Are Noteworthy Among The Oth3R Drawings. Of The Pictures, The Most Striking Is Mr. Tonkss Pastoral Play 65, With Its Clever And Quite Appropriate Suggestionsof Lvatteau. But Wvatteau Would Have Regarded This Not As A Picture, But As The First Rough Indication Of One Before He Sent It Out Into The World He Would Have Finished The Faces, The Hands, The Draperies, With The Most Delicate Accuracy In A Word, He Would Have Painted Like Vatteau, And Not Like A New English Artist, With A Head Full Of The Modern Philosophy Of Short Cuts. Of The Portrait-Painters, Mr. P. W. Steer And Mrw. . W. Russell Send Pictures Before Which One Stands And Says, How -Lever! But Ngt How Charming I Or How Trae! There Are Characteristic Landscapes By Mir. Miark Fisher, Mr. Buxton Knight, And Many Others, Among Which The Two Sent By Mliss Beatrice Bland, Unkindly Skied, Are Among The Most Interesting. But This Lady, Like So Many Of Her Colleagues, Inclines Too Much To The Heresy Of Heavyclouds, Which In Nature Would Infallibly Come Down In Watersponts. For A Few Days, There Are On View At The Goupil Gallery A Nuraber Of Landscapes By The Norwvegian And Parisian Painter Fritz Thaulow, Some Of Whose Pastels We Lately Admired At The Pastel Societys Exhibition. They Are Extremely Clever, And Give A Very True Impression Of The -North In Summer And Wvinter But Their Pattern-High Horizon, Very Little Sky, Compensated By Water With Blue And White Reflexions-Is So Monotonous That After A While One Asks For Something Less Artificial. Close Bv, At Iessrs. P. And D. Colnaghis, In Pall-Mall East, There Is A Small Collection Of The Works Of Mr. D. Y. Cameron, One Of The Chief Members Of The So-Called Glasgow School. As A Painter Mr. Cameron Tries Too Exclusively To Follow Velasauez, Even In His Mannerisms But His Very Aelicate Otchings And Pencil Drawings Show That This Is Not For The Reason Which Prompts So Many Other Followers Of The Ureat Spaniard-Because They Cannot Draw. Lfessrs. Shepherd, At Their Little Gallery In Kingstreet, Have In Their Summer Exhibition A Number Of Old English Pictures, Wvith Some Modern Works. A Portrait Of A Lady By Hoppner Is Brilliant In Painting And Almosttoobrilliantin Colour. There Are Small Works By Constable, Miorland, And J. R. Smith. But The Most Interesting Thing Here Is A Faded Portrait Of James I As A Bov-A Picture With A Genuine Inscription, And In Its Original French Frame With Roy Descosse Faintly Visible Upon It. To Collectors And Students The Most Important Exhibition Of The Week Is That Which Messrs. Aognew Have Arranged In Their Gallery In Old Bond-Street, Containing An Almost, If Not Quits, Complete Collection Of The Old Mezzotint Engravings After Gainshorouh Anld Romney. These, As Is Wvell Knowvn7 Are Much Fewer In The Agtgregate, And Specimens Of Them Are Much Rarer, Than Those After Sir J Oshua. Gainsborough And Romney May Have Been Almost As Fully Employed In Portrait Painting As Reynolds Was-Indeed, No Man Ever Got Through More Work Of This Kind Than Romney Did, Vvho Often Had Five Sitters A Day, And Finished A Portraif In Five Or Sis Sittings-But There Is No Comparison Between The Popularity Of Their Work, As Subjects For Engraving, And That Of Reynolds. There Are Extant Some 700 Prints After Sir Joshua Miessrs. Agnew Can Only Show Us 102 After Romney And 14 After Uainsborough, The Latter Including Many Fancy Subjects. It Is Not Surprising That Sir Joshuas Women Should Ha-Ve Been More Popular Than Those Of Either Of His Rivals, For, Beautiful As Are Romneys Lady Hamilton As Nature, Mrs. Robinson, Miss Woodley, And Others, They Form No Such Unrivalled Gallery As The Lady Bampfylde, The Lady Crosbies, And 20 Or Su More That Might Be Named. And In Translating Gainsboroughs Exquisite Portraits Of Women It Is Undeniable That Tho Engraver Often Found The Task Beyond His Povers. Scarcely One, Except That Of Mr. Elliot And That Of I Madame Baccelli Dancing-The Famous Picture Which Used To Be At Knole-Is Entirely Satisfactory. The Mezzotinter Naturally Preferred The More Generalized Art Of Reynolds And Romney. But In His Rendering Of Gainsboroaughs Men He Often Stucceeded Brilliantly Witness The Sir Harbord Harbord At Norwvich, The Henry Beaufov, The Augustus Etervey, And That Astonishing Pair, The Prince Of Wales And His Friend, Colonel St. Lecger, With Their Horses. With These May Be Compared, Among The Romneys, The Thomas Ord And The Sir Hyde Parker, A Masterpiece By J. Walker, Whose Too Few Mezzotints After Romney Show That He Would Have Ranked With Valentia Green And J. R. Smith If He Had Remained At Work In England. The Engravings After Romney And Gainshorough Seemed To Have Been Taken Off In Very Few I-Npressions At All Events, They Are Now So Rare That, While The Present Craze Endures, Sumas Like 200 Are Quite Commonly Paid For Good Proofs At Auction. This Ought To He Of Good Omen For Our Modem Mezzotinters, The Best Of Whom Are Very Little Inferior To Their Artistic Forefathers.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS218293394/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=aeda8c72,,

The Swedish Art Exhibition, Which Will Open Next Tuesday At Burlington House And Last Till About Febrtuary 15, Will Include More Than 400 Works Of Art 33 Of Which Are Sculptures By About 60 Artists Of The Eighteen-Eighties And Eighteen-Nineties, One Of The Most Brilliant Epochs In The History Of Swedish Art. The Crown Prince Of Sweden Is The Patron Of The Exhibition, And The Swedish Minister In London, Baron Pahnstierna Is Honorary President Of The Committee. Tho Exhibition Bas Been Aranged In Connexion With The Anglo-Swedish Soiety In London, Of Which Lord Burnhamn Is The President. The Organizing Committee, Which Has Directed The Preparations From Stockholmn Is Headed By The Avicee-Pident Of The Swedish Royal Academy Of Arts, Professor Oscar Bjorck, Who Is One Of The Leading Swedish Painters. He Has Been Assisted In The Hanging Of The Pictures By Mr. Sixten Strombom Of The National Museum, Stockholm. The Majority Of The Paintings Have Been Lent From The National Museumnat Stockholm And The Gotlienburg Museum, And Also By Private Collectors, Among Them Prince Eugen, G.R. Thorsten Laurin, And The Thiels Gallery. Among The English Owners Who Have Lent Pictures Are Mrs. Minna Cassel And Mir. Robert Dunthorne. The Exhibition Makes No Claim To Be A Complete Representation Of Swedish Art, And The Limits Of Date Have Not Been Rigidly Observed. Some Of The Exhibitors Are Still In The Forefront Of Living Swedish Art. Not All These Swedish Artists Are Strangers To London. Among Them Is Anders Zorn, Well Known To The British Public As An Eteher Among His Paintings To Be Shown At The Royal Academy Are Some Portraits Of English People. An Arlist Who Will Attract Wide Attention Is The Swedish Painter-Prince Eugen. In The World Of Swedish Painting He Has Struck His Own Note. His Decorative Painting For The New Town Hail In Stockholm Has Received Enthusiastic Praise Both In Sweden And From Forciga Crities Who Have Visited That Building, Which Might Be Described As The Result Of A United Effort Of Leading Aitists In Practically Every Sphere. Fourteen Of Prince Eugens Paintings Will Be Shown At The Exhibition. Other Artists Whose Work Will Be Seen At Burlington House Are Bruno Liljefors, The Animal Painter, And Carl Larsson, The Portrayer Of The Swedish Home And Country Life, And Also Painter Of The Large Frescoes In The Entrance Hall Of The National Museum At Stockholm. An Iulustrated Catalogue Will Be Issued, Containing 32 Reproductions Of Works Exhibted At The Academy.

Even To The Person Whose Knowledge Of The History Of The Ring Is Limited To The Names Of Tom Sayers And Daniel Mendoza, The Boxing Exhibition At The Sporting Gallery, 32, King-Street, Covent Garden, Is Interesting To The Enthusiastic Amateur It Should Be A Mine Of Information And Entertainment. Possibly Because The Drama Is In The Sequence Of Events L Rather Than In The Situation At Any Given Moment The Ring Does Not Seem To Have Attracted The Great Artists Of The Pastthough There Is In This Exhibition A Print 28 Of A Sadly Unsporting Bout After Rowlandson At Any Rate, There Is Nothing In Art To Correspond To The References Of Such Writers, As Byron, Borrow, George Meredith, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Mr. Bernard Shaw, Maurice. Maeterlinck, And Mr. Bohun Lynch-To Run Over Only The First Names That Come To Mind. Between Past And Present In Pictorial Representation The Vexed Question Of Subject Interest In Art Is Very Prettily Illustrated. The Older Artists Concentrated On The Technical Side Of Boxing And The Personalities Of Boxers, Emphasizing Their Points Pretty Much As The Older Artists Of The Turf Emphasized The Points Of Racehorses Modern Artists Go, For The Rnost Part, For The General Impression. Bare Knuckles, By Mr. Alfred Sindall, The Dixie Kid. By Mr. Philip Connard, And A Ringside Impression, By Mr. H. Hope Read, Are All Very Wvell, But It Is Not Until-You Come To The National Sporting Club Series Of Etchings By Mr. George Belcher That You Recover The Peculiar Thrill Of Reality Given By Such Prints As Daniel Mendoza And Richard Humphreys, After C. R. Ryley,.Tom Johnson And Isaac Perrins, After C. Metz, And The Fives Court -Lent By The National Sporting Club-After T. Blake. The Truth Seems To Be-And It Bears Heavily On The Whole Question Of Subject Interest In Art-That If You Plump For Impression You Have To Emphasize The Medium In Order To Make Up For The Corroborative Detail Left Out And It Is This That Gives Bite To The Woodcut A Bout In A Booth, By Mr. Steven Spurrier. L From The Boxiana Point Of View The Centre Of Interest Is Lord Byrons Screen, Covered By The Poet And Gentleman Jackson, Champion Of England, With Portraits And Newspaper Cuttings Relating To Pugilism, Lent By Mr. John Murray. It Bears, Incidentally, An Engraving Of Jackson After The Oil Painting, By B. Marshall, Lent By The National Sporting Club, Hung Beside It And Everything About The Screen Bespeaks A Labour Of Love-The Cuttings Being White-Lined Above And Dark-Lined Below, So That They Appear To Stand Ont In Low Relief Byron Appears Again In A Photograph Of A Print Of Him Boxing With Jackson, Lent By Mr. A. Forbes Sieveking And The Lonsdale Heavy-Weight Belt, Cast Of Tom Sayerss Right Anm, And Gloves Worn By Jimmy Wilde When Boxing Against Pal Moore, 1918, Are Other Objects Of Reverence. Tlhere Is An Interesting Sheet, With Woodcuts In Colour, Of The First Rules Of The Prize Ring, Drawn Up At Broughtons Amphitheatre In 1743, Showing Gloves In Use, Classical Allusions Are Not Neglected, And The Humours Of The Ring Are Pictured By Such Artists As Phil May, Fougasse, Mr. H. M. Bateman, Mr. Bert Thomas, And Mr. Alfred Leete. Nothing, In Short, Is Wanting To Create The Mood Of The Quaker Lady Quoted By Mr. Augustine Birrell. Pity Twas That Ever Corruption Came Amongst Them! She Exclaimed. Amongst Whom ? They Asked Her. The Bruisers Of England, She Firmly Replied. The Greatorex Galleries. Mixed Entertaimnent At The Greatorex Galleries, 14, Gramfto-Street, Begins Vith Etchings Of Winchester, By Mr. Huglh Fisher, Occasionially Jumpy In Values, But Excellenit In Composition And Drawinig, Reachiiig Their Best Hi Tlie Large, Clear, General View Of Wiiichester Cathedral, In Which-As In All Mr. Fishers Work-The Graceful Treatment Of Trees Is To Be Noted. There Lollowv Silver-Points, Mostly Of The Nude Flgure, By Mr. Leonard J. Smith, Owinlg More To The Charm Of The Medium Than To The Style Of Drawing, Which Is Niot More Than Pretty. Thjen There Is A Collection Of Etchings And Dry-Poiits By Various Artists-Wvelcome For Its Emphasis Upon The Comparatively Unfamiliar. Examples Are The Cemetery Wall, By Mr. H. Gordon Warlow Tthe Winding Staircase. Chateau Blois, By Mr. W. Douglas Mlacleod The Falconer, By Mr. H. Harvey And Nant Francon Pass -In Aquatint-By Mr. E. Buckton. La Rochelle, By Mr. Henry Rushbury, And Segovia Bridge, Madrid, By Mr. W. Walcot. Are The Outstanding Things By Acknowledged Masters Of The Art. In Another Room There Are Impressions Of England And Provence, Mostly In Gouache, By Mr. Laurence Bell. These Attract By Their Modest Feeling And Considered Execution, La Lice. Martigues, The Old Sea Wall, Rye, And Sussex Being Three Particularly Good Examples. Picture Frames. The Modern Development Of The Picture Frame Can Be Studied To Advantage At The Galleries Of Mesars. Bourlet, The Fine Art Agents, 17, Nassauistreet, Mortimer-Street, Where There Is On View A Collection Of English, Freneh, And Italian Models. They Are All, Or Nearly All, Reproductions-Though In The Senise Of Free Ihterpretation Rather Than Imitation. The General Principle Followed By Messs. Bourlet Is To Take Hints From Old Examples And Adapt Them To Present-Day Requirements, Keeping The Flavour Of The Original, But Allowing A Wide Margin For Modification In Harmony With The Individual Picture. This Breaking Away From The Victorian Convention, With Its Overelaborate Mouldings And Hard, Bright Gold, Was A Long And Diflcult Business. At First There Were Difficulties With Workmen Over The Substitution Of Freehand Methods Of Decoration For Mechanical Accuracy, And The Toning Of The Gold Leaf By Means Of Applied Colour To Suit The Picture Was Looked Upon As Almost Immoral. Another Difficulty Was Getting The Right Quality Of Gesso For Omamert In Relief A Difficulty Which Was Only Solved By Importiiig Chalk From Bologna Prepared By A Method Which Seems To Have Been In Use Since Thei Days Of Cennino Cennini. This Allows The Detail Of Ornament To Be Applied In Fuu Relief Niith One Stroke Of The Brush, Thus Avoiding The Risk Of Cracking Between Separate Layers. I Altogether, As An Object-Lesson In The Gradual Substitution Of Elasticity For Rigidity In Thel Convention Of The Picture Frame, While Keeping The Flavcur Of Style, The Exlhibition Is Extremely Intercsting. Independent Artists. In The Somewlhat Robust Surroundings Of Messrs. Parsonss Showrooms, 315-317, Oxfordstreet, The Society Of Independent Artists Are Now Holding Their Second Exhibition. What These Artists Arc Independent From-Except In Some Instances From The Humdrum Responsibilities Of The Craft-Is Not Very Clear Since A Society Is A Society, And It Is Difficult To See Why A Member Of This One Is More Independent Than A Member Of, Say, The New English Art Club Or The R.B.A. However, The Collection Of 82 Paintings, Drawings, And Prints Affords Some Entertainment. It Is Most In Aecord With The Commonplace Artistic Virtues In The Market Scencs, Bidingsgate And Stratton Grounds, By Mr. Powys Evans, Who Is Best Known As A Caricaturist And The Circus Scenes.The Jockey Act, In Particular, By Miss Gwen Evans.

Are Other Oil Paintings Which -Admit Dependence Upon The Usual Means-Of Making A Picture, And, For The Vet The Most Profitable Search Will Be Among The Drawings And Eolou-Prints.

What We Waant To See Is Not So Mucei The Work Of Artists Who Happen To Be Soldiers, As How Professional Soldiers, Who Happen To Have Artistic Talent, Paint And Drawv-Particularly In The Scenes Of Their Professional Experience. It Is A Large Exhibition, Of A82 Works-20U More Than Last Year-And The Great Majorily Of Them Are Vater-Colours, Which Helps To Explain The General Effect Of Service Conditions, Since Oil Colours Are A Nuisance To Carry About. Possibly Without Reason One Is Struck By The Proportion Of Higher Ranks Among The Exhibitors. Particularly In The First Room The Standard In Water-Colour Is Remarkably Highli Gateway, Purana Kila, Delhi, By Lieutenant R. H. Sams, Old Bridge House, Amibleside. By Major.I. A. Wilkinson, Canal, Hevbridge, By Lieutenant-Colonel C. Connell, Salthouse Marshes, By Major-General Sir A. Scott, And Miarshside, By Captain T. 11. Barnard, Are Only A Few Of The Works That Excite Genuitne Admiration. In The Big Room The Level Is Morc Ordinary, Though The Mountain Landscapes Of Colonel H. R. B. Donne, Alverna.

Null,Art Exhibition,The Times,1929-Apr-04,"London, England","Art Exhibition. Mir. Christopher Wood. J The General Impression Made By The I Paintings By Amr. Christopher Wood At Messrs. Arthur Tooths, 155, New Bondstreet, Is That Tfle Artist Goes About The World With A Lively Curiosity And Paints Wvhen He Is Really Stung By The Subject Before Him. One Consequence Is That His I Pictures Contain Rather More Of His Ordinary-And Rather Boyish-Interests Tlha Is Commnor In The Work Of Our Yotunger Artists, Who Are Generally On Guard Against Any Interest That Cannot Be Called Wisthetic, And This Nk-Es For Variety. After All, The World Contains A Number Of Things. 3Ir. Wood, In Short, May Be Called An Ingenuous Artist, With An Attractive Combination Of Originality And Receptiveness, Very Direct In His Methods. His Paintings Of St. Ives, Cornwall, May Surprise Those Who Have Been Brought Up On The Productions Of The Colony There, But There Is More Warrant For Them In The Facts Than Their Oddity Might Suggest. At St. Ives You Have Not Really Come To The Granite, Which Prevails Faither West, And The Rocks Have A Twisty, Gnarled Character, Admirably Brought Out M Clodgy And The Island, St.. Ives. These Physical Facts May Not Seem Relevant To The Discussion Of Painting, But. They Affect The Look Of Things, And Part Of T.He Interest Of Mr. Woods Painting Is Its Unconscious Revehition Of Things That You Happen To Know. Entrance To St. Ives Harbour, With Its Effect Of Bustle, Is Perhaps The Best And Most Concentrated Painting Of The Series, But They All Have The Interest Of Something Seen With A Fresh And Unprejudiced Eye And Set Down With An Eager Hand. The Effect Of Discovery Is Characteristic Of All Mr. Woods Work-The Rather Wicked Colour Of Irises, The Orange And Lemon Of Tiger Lilies, And The Blunt Beauty Of Red Dahlias In Their Brown Pitcher. His Danger, One Would Say, Is Quaintness, But That He Can Rise To Larger Interests Is Shown In The Excellent Painting Of A Woman Alone, In Which Everything Is Subordiniated To The Monumental Impact Of The Shoulders On The Lighted Wall And The Downward Sweep Of The Brown Curtain.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS169418884/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=4119a015,,

Most Of Iiis Works Pass Through Niianiy States, And The Final Impression Of One Of Iiis Colour Prints, Such As Davn, Represents More Thani A Dozen Printings. To Quote Hiis Owii Words, The Motive Of The Graver-Printer . . . Is To Realize In A Print An Original Composition In Colour Conecived In Llis Niind As-A Print, And Depending For Its Beauty Exclusively On The Means To Be Used In And For Printing. The Exhibition Gives A Practically Comlplete Representation Of Mr. Roussels Workl Betveen 1888 And 1919.

Under The General Title Of Desire And Destiny There Are At Walkers Galleries, 118, New Bond-Street. A Number Of Wvatercoloni- Drawings By Mr.V W. H. Walker Whiclh Are In Fact W-Himsicalities. Nobody Else Is Working In Quite The Samre Vein. And T4R. Walker Has A Genuine Turn For The Conceit. His Drawing, Though Not Distinguished, Is Quite Adequate For The Scale On Which He Works, His Colour Is Generally Pretty And Sometimes Charming, He Has A Feeling For Quality And His Invention Never Fails. The Game Of Love, Whicli He Treats Witlh Ironical Tenderness, Provides Him With Most Of His Subjects. The Happiest In Invention-Besides Giving Him An Opportunity For The Delicate Still-Life Paintinig In Whieh He Excelsis The Lost Property Office, With Father Time Restorinig To A Very Modlem Damsel Her Lost Love Over The Counter With A Genial Air Of Dont Be So Careless Again. Round The Shelves Of The Oflice Are Stacked, In Times Keeping, Lost Hopes, Illusions, Hearts, Opportunities, Youth. Sleep, Faith, Consciences, And So On And We Note That Time Keeps Old Flames In Cold Storage, And That He Will Receive No Tips. Some Of The Clrawings, Such As Tihe Apple Harvest And Pink Curtains And Matuve Stockings, Are None The Worse For Being Slightly Luscious It Is All In Tlle Vein And A Miothers Meeting, Of Mice With Embarrassing Litters Who Are Being Advised By A Frog Wise-Woman From A Volume Bearing The Naxne -Of A Competent Authoritv, Is Fair Comment. Whimsical Walker, As He Must Be Called, Does Not Pretend To Play Upon The Larger Enmotions, But He Wins And Merits A Chuckle Or A Sigh. A Versatile Artist. In A Chelsea Studio At 1., Wvellingtonstreet, Flood-Street, Kings-Road, Converted From A Hayloft And Mainly Fuirnished By The Artist Himself, There Are To Be Seen From 3 To 7 Daily Some Paintings, Water-Colours, Pastels And Etchings Which Have At Least The Merits Of Originality And Suggestiveness. The Artist Is Mlr. F. H. Haagensen, English-Born But Evidently Owina Something To Norwegian Extraction In His Capacity For Handling Wood. His Etching-Press, For Example, Which He Built Himself, Wo.Ld Pass For A Professional Construction. Mr. Haagensen Is Clearly The Kind Of Artist Who Puts Mood Before Everything-Mood And A Medium. He Is, On The Whole, Happiest In Water-Colour, Which He Handles Very Broadly, Letting The Design Happen Out Of The Wasti Witlh Excellent Effect In Rain, Two Studies Of Seaweed Gatherers, And Charging Assyrions. The Oil Paintings Lack Somewiat In Organization, But They Are Goodiii Quality And Fuill Of The Emotional- Atmosphere Intended-Particularly The Desert -- And The Etchings Have Imagination And Freedom In Execution.

Different As They Are In Style And Mood, The 1 Paintings In Oil And Water-Colour By The Polish Artist Maurice Minlkowski, And The Crayon Drawings By The Ulster Artist Mt. William Conor, At The Galleries Of 3Lr. Godfrey Phillips 44, Duke-Street, St. Jamness, Have It In Co,Rrion That They Deal With What Is Conveniently Called Life. Both Artists Are Competent, But They Are More Interested In Their Fellowcreaitures -Than In Pictur6-Making As An End In Itself. There, However, The Resetablance Endsfor Minkowski Deals Rather Heavily In Method With The Victimus Of War And Revolution In His Native Country, While Mr. Conor Deals Lightly In Method With The Hard-Bitten But Eminently Cheerful Life Of The Streets Of Belfast. Though They Are Not In The Least Propagandist, The Plctdres Of- Minkowski Are Very Difficult To See As Pictures, Because The Human Element Is So Strong In Them. Representiag Such Subjects As The Refugees, Orphans, The Bread Queue, And, Tramping, They Are Painted Not As By The Detached Observer, Or By One With A Feeling For Drama, But As If The Artist Shared The Experiences, They Are Almbst Too Quiet To Be Called Harrowing, The Prevailing Mooa Being One Of Dazed Hopelessness-As Expressed In The Title Whither P The Most Striking General Effect Is Tbat Of Cotnplete Silence. It Is Pertinent To Say That Alinkowski, Who Was Born At Warsaw In 1881, Is A Deaf Mute, And This, No Doubt-Apart From His Unmistakable Sympathy With The Poor And Suffering-Has Tnfluenced His Attitude, Which Is One Of Acceptaiice Rather Than Protest. There Is Not A Single Hint In Any Of The Pictures Of Anybody To Blame. As An Artist Minkowski Has An Unobtrusive Skill In Grouping, He Draws Well Enough, His Colour, Though Naturally Sober, Is Not Unpleasin8, And Technically He Is Very Accomplished-Particularly In Watercolour. He Is Most Interesting Pictorially When The Character Of Costume Has Dictated An Artangement That Can Be Called Decorative -As In Praying Women He Is A Jew And Otphans. One Concludes Finally That The Freedom Of His Work From Theatrical Or Sentimental Appeal Is Due To Artistic Quatlities-Though They Would Be Difficult To Deflne. Vworking In Coloured Crayons In A Method Of His Own-Producing An Effect Very Much Like Lithography-Mr. Conor Gives The Impression Of Xaving Erioyed Eveiy Moment, Humanly Anatechnically. Hlis Drawings-Of Which The Staple Material Is The Street Corner-Are Full Of Light And Movemnent, And, Except Tbat Occasionally A Head Is Prettifled, They Appear To Be Very True In Aharacter.

De Laszl6 At The French Gallery, 120, Pall Mall, Lack Depth And Subtlety Would Be Like Complaining That You Did Not Get A Heart-To-Heart Talk With Your Hostess At A Social Function. It Is The Public Rather Than The Private Appearance Of His Subjects That Mr. De 1Asz16 Presents, And He Must Be Judged Accord. Ingly. On His Own Lines, As A Fashionable Portrait Painter, He Is Not Without His Defects. He Has A Remarkable Gift For Flling A Canvas Easily, But For Permanent Satisfaction His Pictures Would Gain By A More Architectural I311Ing-Not With Architectural Features But With A More Stable System Of Horizontals And Verticals. Too Mnany Of His Larger Compositions- His Grace The Lord Archibishop Of Canterbury Is The Worst Example, But It Vexes Also In The Marquess Of Reading -Have What May Be Called A Diagonal Drift, As If The Artist Were Detetmined At All Costs To Keep Things Moving. His Colour, Too, Would Lose Nothing In Bravery If It Were Truer In Values. For Lack Of Attention To This Rather Than From Defective Construction The Figure Of His Majesty The King Of Spain Looks Incoherent Under A Well-Painted Head, And There Are Several Instanes In Tne Exhibition In Which The Ribbon Of An Order Jumps Out Of The Context With Disturbing Effect. Time May Do Something To Remedy This, But As Painted Mr. De Laszl6S Work Is More Pleasing When It Depends Upon Relations Of Tone And Not Colour Amadame La Duchesse Dltrsel, For A Good Example. What Really Commends Itself In The Work Of Mr. De Lasz16 Is His Wholehearted Enjoyment Of The Social Scene. There Is No Suggestion That He Comes To It By Anything But Positive Preference, And That In Itself Is Enough To Aecount For His Popularity. He Fulfils On Canvas -With Unfailing Gusto And Chic What People Aim At In Their Public Appearances, And He Gives To It Just The Slight Foreign Acecent Which Pleases A People Naturally Reserved. H.R.H. The Princess Beatrice Is One Of The Best Heads In The Exhibition. Her Grace The Duchess Of Portland Pleases By The Aptness Of The Placing On The Unprimed Canvas, The Accent Of The Head, And The Hang Of The Veil And Pearls And Among The More Successful Of The Other Portraits Are H.R.H. The Duchess Of York, The Marquess Of Reading, H.R.H. The Prince Of Asturias, And Miss Dorothy Carnegie. From The Point Of View Of Distinguished Personalities, The Special Feature Of The Exhibition Is The Series Of Spanish Royal Portraits. Drypoints Of The East. Mr. Charles W. Cains Exhibition Of Drypoints, At The Greatorex Galleries, 14, Graftonstreet, Bond-Street, Consists For The Most Part Of Topographical Etchings, In Which Either The Picturesque And Exotic Scenery Of Burma Or Mesopotamia Or Incidents Of Native Life Are Intended To Be The Most Immediate Concern Of The Spectator. Thus. The Artist Is Working Under Difficulties, For He Has To Subordinate Picturesque Fragments If He Wishes To Make A Self-Centred Design, And He May Not Do This Lest These Fragments Seem No Longer Picturesque But Merely Elements Which Are Cold And Unneaning Except When They Are Combined In A Particular Wav. And, Moreover, To Make A Design Out Of Such Subjects, Mr. Cain Would Have Had To Combine A Series Of Objects Of Which Any Artist Except A Vigorous Romantic Like Delacroix Might Well Have Been Frightened. In Fact, In Any Other Medium But Etching Mr. Cains Problem Would Have Been Insoluble. But Etching Is Particularly Suitable For Such Illustration As This. Mr. Cain Has Mastered His Medium And Can Make It Do For Him A Great Deal Which In Painting Only A Pure Painter Could Have Done. The Picturesque Fragments May Remain Picturesque And Not An Integral Part Of A Design, But The Medium, Neverthieless, Asserts Itself Naturally. As Would Not Happen In Painting, And Thus Mr. Cains Drvpoints Have An Air Of Being Works Of Art, Whiclh, Perhaps, They Do Not Really Deserve. This Self-Assertion Of The Medium Is Particularly Fortunate In Mr. Cains Darker And More Elaborate Pr Ints.

Null,Art Treasures,The Times,1928-May-01,"London, England","Art Treasures. E Exhibition Opened In London. An Appeal To English Collectors. The Exhibition Of Art Treasures At. The Grafton Galleries, Grafton-Street, W., Which Has Been Organized By The British Antique Dealers Association, Was Formally Opened Yesterday By Lord Lee Of Farehar. A Notice Of - The Exhibition Appeared In The Times Yesterday. Mr. Raneis Mallett, President Of The Association, Presided At The Opening Ceremony And Said That It Was Fitting That The Giver Of Chequers, A House Of Many Treasures, To The Prime Ministers Of England Should Open Their Exhibition. Loan Lee Of Fameham, Before Declaring The Exhibition Open, Said That In A Few Scattered Quarters He Had Heard Adverse Criticisms Both Of The Objects Of The Exhibition And Of His Action In Opening It. There Were Some Zealous People Who Said That The Result Would Be To Nmunish Still Further The Number Of Our Dwindling National Treasures That Soon There Would Be Nothing Left In The Country That Our Heritage Would Be Dispersed For Vulgar Cash, Usualy In The Form Of Dollars And That They Were Engaged In An Unpatriotic Enterprise. Lhe Truth Was Absolutely The Reverse. If The British Public Really Cared For These Beautiful Things, And If They Would Only Take Advantage Of That Absolutely Unique Opportunity Which Was Now Being Offered To Them, The Best Of The Treasures Would Be, Or Should Be, Retained In This Country. That Was The Object Of The Promoters Of The Exhibition. In Any Case, The Criticism Was Somewbat Futile. Miost Of These Treasures Were Not Private Possessions. Some Were From The Private Collections Of Dealers, And Were Not For Sale, But The Bulk Of Them Probably Were In The Market. They Were Dealers Stock, And As Such They Were Liable To Be Sold To Whoever Came Forward To Purchase Them. With The Possible Exception Of Paintings, Not Represented There, They Represented The Selected Cream Or The Stock In The Trade To-Day. The English Collectors Had Never Had Such An Opportunity Before. Generauy Speaking, They Had Very Littia Ides, As To What Was Actually In The Market. As A Class The English Collectors Were Inclined To Be Unenterprisiig, Timid, Even Shy, In Their Search For The Things They Would Like. He Had Often Suggested To His Picture-Selling Friends That They Should Occasionally-Or Even Pehmanently-Have In Their Own Premises A Smal Exhibition-Of Their Pictures, So That A Purchaser Might Inspect Them Quietly By Himself, Instead Of Having To Be Led Into An Inner Sanctum Where Pictures Were Brought Forward One By One And Could Only Be Seen Under The Watchful Eye Of The Vendor Himself. That Wac Very Embarrasing For The Ordinary Picture Collector. He Congratulated The Promoters Of The Exhibition On The Great Taste And Skiu With Which The Objects Had Been Arranged And Displayed. It Was To Hiin The Niost Exciting Exhibition He Had Ever Attended. With Comparatively Few Eaceptions, There Was Nothing There Which Tfhe Enterprising Collector, With Means And The Necessary Quickness Of Decision, Would Not Like To Add To His Collection. He Had No Doubt That The Best Things Would Go Quickly, And He Trembled To Think What Would Happen If They Got A Message From Mr. Ford, Who Was Now In This Country, Saying That He Would Buy Tie Lot. On The Whole The Prices In England For Such Treasures Were Lower Than On The Continent But There Was The Curious Phenomenon That Englishmen Went Abroad For An Expensive Holiday, Visited Foreign Dealers, And Made The Most Gullible And Unfortunate Purchases At Much Higher Prices, Feeling At The Same Time That They Had Done Rather A Smart Thing. His Advice To Collectors Was To Take Their Courage In Both Hands And Buy What They Liked Themselves-Not What They Were Told To Like-Provided That The Quality Was Right. He Recalled A Visit He Paid To Mr. Pierpont Morgans House In Princes-Gate Many Years Ago. Mr. Pierpont Morgan Pointed To A Little Picture Of A Dutch Girl, And Said That Was The Thing He Liked Best In His Whole Collection, For The Reason That He Had Chosen It Hinself. In A Reference To The Association, He Said It Was A Guild In The Best Sense Of The Word, And It Was Also A Philanthropic Body Concerned With The Care Of Those Of The Trade Whai Might Be In Misfortune. It Was A Great Satisfaction To Know That While One-Half Of The Proceeds Of The. Exhibition Would. Go To The Associations Benevolent Fund The Other Half, Would Be Given To The National Art Collections Fund And Would Thus Be Available For The Purchase Of Further Art Treasures For The, Nation. Cheers. Among Those Present Were - King Manoel. Lord Salisbury. Sir Wisuhm Plender. Sir Charles Allom. Sir William Burrell. Sir Charles Holmes. Sir Montague Barlow. Mr. H. Cuthbertson. Mr. Ciifford Smith. And Mlr. H. Oppenheim. Mr. Henry Ford Visited The Exhibition.

The Third Annual Exhibition Of Watercolours By Tumer And Other Masters Of The English School At The Cotswold Gallery, 59, Frith-Street. Soho, Represents What May Be Called The More Serious Development Of The Art, With The Emphasis Upon Drawing And A Comparative Limitation Of Colour. There Are 47 Drawings, Including Eight By Turner, And These Last -Though Three Of Them Are Late-Are Of A Kind To Relate Him To, Rather Thanx Distinguish Him From, The School. That Is To Say, The Lovely Colour Of Lake Of Lucerne-Morning, Of 1842. And Geneva From The Wvest, Of 1836, Suggests A Flowering Of The Effort Represented By The Other Works Rather Than An Effort Of A New Kind. The Lucerne Drawing, A Miracle Of Space Delimitation By Slight Means, Made Whon Turner Was Nearly 70, Is Hung Next To Mouth Of The Avon, Near Bristol, Made When He Was 17 And Though There Is A Lifetime Of Technical Accomplishment Between Them. There Is Felt In The Early Drawing That Grasp Of The Conditions As A Whole Which Is So Lightly Held In The Late One. Thev Represent The Student And The Master Of Lthe Problem Involved. Another Very Interesting Turner Is London And Westininster, From The Top Of Air. Walter Fawkess House, 45, Grosvenor-Place Precise And Yet Atmospheric, Kept Quiet In Colour As Becomes Its Topographical Intention. The Collection As A Wvhole Extends Our Knowledge Of The School Rather Than Insists Upon The Familiar. There Are Three Dravings By Alexander Cozens, Including A Massive Composi.Tion Of The Old Oak, Gripping The Rock, And The Harbour. One Of His Very Few Coloured Drawings, In Delicate Hues Of Green. Blue, And Lilac. Entranice To The Tyrol, Representing A Castle On A Wooded Bill, And Exceptionally Full In Tone Through Good Preservation, Is One Of The Drawings Made By John Robert Cozens For William Beckford. Other Drawiings Of Particular Note In A Collection Whichl Is Interesting And Informing Throughout Are A Bealltiflulv Balanceci S.E. Aspect Of The Church At Odell, Bedfordshire, By Thomas Heame. Identified By An Engraving A Solid Interior Of A Church, Unidentified, By An Artist Unknown A Little Masterpiece I Of Simplicity, The. Mill Stream, By V John Varley And Two Classical Compositions Of Girls, Welsh And Scotch, At A Well, By Joshua Cristall. Harry Fijrniss. The Exuberant Art Of The Iste Mr. Harry Furniss Can Be Studied To Advantage In A Memorial Exhibition Of His Drawings At The Galleries Of The Fine Art Society. 148, New Bond-Street. To The Nunmber Of 142, Thev Cover The Full Range Of His Activities, As Political And Puneh Cartoonist, Illustrator Of Dickens, Thackeray, And Lewis Carroll, Csuicaturist And Satirist Of Modern Society. Mr. Furmiss Had A Genius For Getting Things Done, Which Went A Long Wav To Rake Up For His Lack Of Subtlety In Feeling And Refinement In Style. As A Draughtsman He Was Forcible And Fluent Rather Than Expressive Or Precise, And He Always Drew At The Top Of His Voice. His Illustrations To Dickens And Thackeray Cannot Be Said To Adorn Their Pages,- But It Is Quite Likely That His Over-Emphasis Of El-Aracter And Situation Brought The Stories Home To Many People Whose Imagination Did Not Respond To The Vriters Themselves. To The Writers Mr. Furnss Acted As A Sort Of Showman. For Some Reasons This Exhibition Is Almest Disconcertingly Interesting. Thus, If The Contemporary Moralist Wanted Documentary Evidence Of The Spirit That Originated The Word Mnicking He Coald Not Find It Better Than In The Cartoon Entitled Ladysmith. M3Arch, 1900. As A Satirist Of Modern Society Mr. Furniss Was Too Rhetorical To Get Home, And The Drawings With That Intention Suggest The Presentation Of The Seener And Situations By Barnstorming Actors Rather Than Anyting In Tul Life. But Mr. Furniss Was Perfectly Honest In His Point Of View, And Enthusiastic In Its Expression, And, Taking His Range And Fertilty Into Awcount, He Must, Be Regarded As A Formidable Figure In The History Of English Humorous Art.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS135993496/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=81f281dd,,

To Appreciate The Productions Of A More Ambitions Form Of Art. Appealing As They Do To The Most Widespread And Least Exacting Kind Of Taste, We Have No Right To Complain That There Is Little To Be Found In Them Of Ideal A-In, Or Even Highly Elaborated Representation Of Outwardcobjects. Toinsiston Morevariety, Moredepthof Insight,Moreeffort To Grasp The Grander Moods And Rarer Moments Of Earth, Sea, And Sky, More Patient And Loving Labour, Would Be To Forget The Conditions, Under Which These Drawings Are Produced, The Purchasers They Attract, The Prices They Command.

In Short, There Are No Exhibitions In London The Contributors To Which Are So Hopelessly In The Iut As Those Of Our Two Water-Colour Societies, And None, Therefore, From Which It Is So Difflcult To Carry Away A New Impression Or Fresh Matter For Annual Criticism Or Comment. What Last Years Exhibition Was This Years Is, And Next Years Is Like To Be. E Se Ino New Talents Growing Up To Push The Old Ones From The Walls-No Daring Pre-Raffaelites Of Water-Colour, Defying Ouitworn Conventionalism-No Aspiring Geniuses, Bent On Throwing Into This Facile And Fascinating Branch Of Design The Elevation Of Earnestness, Or Even The Shock Of Eccentricity. Until Some Man Shall Arise With The Determination To Show That A Water-Colour Drawing May Do Something More Than Please The Eye And Prettily Ornament A Draw-Ing-Room-Some One Who Shall Dare To Attempt To Turn Beauty Of Form, And Depth, And Subtlety Of Expression To The Same Account As W. Hunt Has Turned The Homely Truth Of Everyday Faces, And The Features That Belong To Ignoble Needs Or Ludicrous Incidents -We Must Be Content, Year After Year, To Tell The Public, What The Public Needs Not Be Told, That Its Old Favourites In Pall-Mallare Doing This Year The Same Sort Of Thing They Have Been Doing For The Last 20 Years, With Much The Same Average Of Skill And Mastery. Thjo New Water-Colour Society Has No Painter Of Faces, Fruit, And Flowers Like W. Hunt No Great Master Of Landscape, Within A Certain Range, Like David Cox No Consummate Sovereign Of Manipulation And Technical Composition Like Harding No Patient And Microscopic Delineator Like John Lewis. But It Has Stil Its Lewis Haghe, Unrivalled For Skilful Combination Of The In And Oat Door Burgher Life Of The 17Th Century, With The Civic And Ecclesiastical Architecture In Which It Was Set, And Who This Year Contributes Five Drawings-The Drinking Scng, A Party Of Belgian Burgher Gaardsmen Carousing In Their Guiardroom 64 The Spy, A Villanous-Looking Rascal, Brought In Custody Of A Couple Of Archers Before The Prince-Bishop Of Saltzburg In A Chamber Of His Castle 85 The Drill, Soldiers Amusing Themselves With A Poodle, Planted Gravely, Stick Inpaw, In The Midst Of Them 172 The Transept Of The Church Of St. Mark At Venice, With The Sun Glowing From The Golden Mosaic Ground Of Dome And Waggon-Roof, And On The Marble Of Wall And Pavement, And-To Balance This Upper Splendour-A Presentation By Carmagno7.A Of The Standard Of The Republic To The Doge After The Victory Of Macalo 195, And One Of The Side Screens Of The Same Church 214. In Former Years This Artist Has Exhibited Larger And More Ambitions Works, But These Have His Characteristic Merits Of Skilful Arrangement, Good Colour, Brilliant Daylight, And Correct Drawing Both Of Figures And Architecture. Mr. H. Warren Is, As Usual, True To The East, Which He Has Never, We Believe, Visited, Though He So Continually Resorts To It For Subjects. In Costume And Accessories Those Who Inow The Nile And The Desert Assert That He Is Correct But We Are Not Sure That This Truth Extends To The General Colour And Tone Of His Drawings. His Last Work 157 This Year Seemed To Us The Most Impressive. It Represents An Arab Coming Down To Water His Camel In The Nile By Moonlight. His Large Pictulre, The Song Of The Georgian Mfaiden, From Mioores Lig,Ht Of The Harenm 182 Is A Daring Attempt To Combine The Utmost Splendour Of, Colour With Thle Most Minute Elaboration Of Eastern Tissues And Patterns. Warren Seems In This Work To Beaiming At A Competition With John Lewis But, Painstaking And Gorgeous As His Drawing Is, It Misses The Delicacy And Refinement Of Lewis, And Rather Dazzles Than Satisfies The Eye. Above All, It Is Defective In Aerial Tone, Andthere Is Nothing Inthe Forms Or Composition To Make Up For This Defect. Still It Is The Work At Once Of Greatest Labour And Of Highest Aim, In Its Sensual Way, That We Remember To Liave Seen From Mr. Warrenshand. Mr. E. Warren-The Son Of The President-Is As Determinedly English As His Father Is Eastern, And His Large Drawing Of A Beech In The Forest Of Dean 207 Is By Very Far The Completest Piece Of Work In The Gallery. The Rounded Stem And Arms Of The Noble Tree, Wvith All Its Accidents Of Moss, Stain, And Lichen, Sunfleck And Shadow, The Multitudinous Leafage, With Peeps Of Blue Sky Seen Through, The Thick Carpet Of Last Years Russet Leaves That Strew The Ground. Are Rendered With Marvellously Patient And Successful Labour. Mr. Warren Has Evidentlycalledthe Photographtohisaidas Well Asnature, And With A Result, As It Seems To Us, Difficultto Surpass In Its Accuracy Of Realization. Neither Of His Other Drawings, The Road By The Mill Stream 32 And The Pleasure Party 170, Is At All As Satisfactory As This Noble Study Of A Beech Tree. Yet There Are Parts Of The Former, Especially The Bridge In The Lefthand Corner Of The Foreground, And The Path Winding Upward From It Under The Trees, Which Are So Comapletely Carried Out As To Render Us Very Intolerant Of The Splotch Of Red Spots, Intended, Doubtless, For Poppies, And The Bird, -With A Poppy-Red Breast, On The Hand-Rail Of The Bridge, And The Ill-Drawn Water Of The Stream. Mr. Benmett Is Completely Himself This Year. We Need Say No More To Those Who Know And Love The Russet And Yellowing Greens Of This Painter, Who Seems To Have Stopped At A Point Very Far Short Of What His Earlier Works Promised. His Drawings Seem To Us This Year To Have Even Less Daylight Than Usual, Though There Is A Beautiful Effect Of Breaking Sunshine On The Hills Beyond The Lake In The Middle Distance Of His Glengarifi 10. Of All Of Them, We Should Be Inclined To Select One Of The Least Pretentious As The Most Satisfactory, A View Near Streatham On A Fine Miorning 47, Which Has Most Of That Sunlight Of Which The Painter Is So Muceh Too Sparing. As An Example Of Failure In Rendering Light, And That In A Subject Where Light, Was All In All For The Trnthful Effect Of The Drawing, We May Point To His Glen Nevis 2913, In Which He Has Aimed At Giving The Glory Of Sunset Upon Seotch Firs-Than Which Nothing In Nature Canbe More Magical In The Drawing All Splendour Is Lost From The Laek Of Contrast Between The Busnished Copper Of The Limbs Where The Sunlight Sirikes Them, And The Solemn Green And Bronze Of The Unlighted Leaf-Layers And Lrauceles.

Vacher Evidently Aims At It, And In Upgn5N Of His Numerous Drawings This Year, Some From Iaaly, Others Fram Algeria, He Has Succeeded In Obtaininm It, In His Dstauces At Least, Though Their Value Is Muich Impaired By The Want Of Force And Truth In His Foregrounds. Mr. Vacher Seems To Have Consecrated Himself To The Service Of The Setting Sun, And To Have Vowed To Represent Nature Only Under The Regal. Purple She Wears At The Close Of Day. This Tends To Give A Monotony And Wearisomeneis To His Rwork, Under The Influence Of Which It Is Difficult To Do, Justice To Its Really Delicate And Refined Qualities. And Vhy Will He Mar The Merit Of An Elaborate Dlrvting Like That Of The M Kadonna Del Sasso 23 By Groups Of Unreal Figures Liko Those Which Disfigure His Foreground, And Which Belong To Southern Italy, And Not Northern, If, Indeed, They Have Any Existence Out Of The Atliers Of Prome ? So In His Capri 117, A Really Important Work For Size And Pains, We Are Apt To Stop In Disgust At The Formless And Lumpish Rockwork Of The Foreground Which First Arrests Our Attention, And Find It Difficult To Pass From It To The Beautyandtiruth Of The Distant Cliffs That Risein Alternations Of Warm, Golden Splendo-Ur, And Cool Purple Shadow, From The Sapphire Sea. Of Nir. Vachers Many Drawings Here We Should Select As The Best 63, Lthe Romaan Wvalls Of Constantine, A Rockperched City, Looking Npon A Stretch Of Purple Plain, And Tie Approach To An Italian Townn 184, A Very Fine Composition, With A Truth Of Local Colour, -Vwich, Perhaps, One Values The More From Its Juxtaposition To The Castel Gandolfo Of Mr. Rowbotham. Mr. Rowbotham Deserves Special Comment, As The Crowvning Professor Of That Fatally Attractive Style Of Drawing Of Which He Is The Incarnation In The New Society As Mr. Richardson Is In The Old. M1Astery Of The Material, Firmness Of Hand In Outline, Precision Of Touch, Command Of The Technical Resources Of Composition, Clearness Of Colour, Prettiness Of Grouping, Skill In The Disposition Of Accessor Es-All These Mr. Rowbotham Possesses In A Ahigh Degree. But You Will Seek In Vain Throughout His Many Drawings, Great And Small, For One Impression Of Truth, One Indication Of Genuine, Uaffected Love Or Reverence For Nature-One Touch That, Coming From The Heart Of The Artist, Goes Straight To The Heart Of The Spectator. We Feel Inclned To Doubt, After Studying His Many Italian Dlrawings In This Exhibition, Wrhether 3Ir. Rowbotham Has Ever Been In Italy, So Utterly, So Curiously Unreal Are They, So Suggestive Now Of The Panoramas And The Theatre, Anon Of Mr.Richardson And Mr. Harding, But Never In The Slightest Degree, Or In Any Point Of Colour, Accessories Or Effects Of The Real Scene. 1R. Rowbothams Art Is The Art Of The Drawing Master, Pur Et Simute In All Of Most Mechanical, Conventional, Meretricious, And Enervating, That The Word Can Be Taken To Convey. It Is Not From Any Desire To Cause Pain That This Harsh Language Is Applied To These Drawings, But Because They Are, From Their Very Faults, So Pleasing To Superficial Eves, So Calculated To Mislead Students To Substitute The Effort After Pleasant Falsity For The Resolute Struggle After Stern Truth, So Emasculate In Themselves And So Emasculating In Their Influence That Either It Is A Daty To Stigmatize The School To Which They Belong Or Criticism Is A Farce Altogether. It Is A Pleasure To Turn From Mr. Rowbothams Achievements In The Way Of Finished Falsehood To The Most Incomplete Efforts Of A Hard-Working, Honest Student, Such As Mir. Sutcliffe Seems To Be. He Has Almost Everything To Learn In His Art, Except The Great Truth That Its Onlyfoundation Must Be Nature. He Appears From His Seven Drawings Here To Be Workingv Under The Influence Of This Truth And Though He Has Failed Egregiously In His Largest Efort 328, Mill At Weusley, Yorkshire, Where His Sunshine And Shadow Are Patchy And Incompatible, His Skv Devoid Of Light, And His Distances, Proportions, And Composition All Curiously Blundered-He Has, In Two. Or Three More Modest Attempts-Particularly One Called Spring 187-Rendered, With A Faithfulness And Respect Which Give Excellent Promise For The Future. The Tender Colour And Delicate Foliage Of The Opening Year. Mr. S. Cook Is No Learner. He Has As Great A Command Over The Technical Means Of His Art As Any Draughtsman In The Society. Bat In His Careful Studies Of The Cornwall And Devonshire Coasts He Displays, Besides The Practised Hand Of The Thoughtful Designer, A Delicate Appreciation Of The Trnths Of Sea And Clihf, The Workings Of Tide And Wind, Which Give To His Drawings Well-Nigh As High A Value As Such Transcripts Of Nature Can Have. We May Mention, As Especiary Good Examples Of This Painter, The Rising Of The Ground Sea, Treburwith, Cornwall Lii, Where The Dance Of The Bottle-Green Inshore Water, Spanned By A Faint Rainbow, Under The Watery Light Of A Sunburst, That Has Brolen Through A Shower, The Tail Of Which Still Veils The Cliff On The Left Hand Of The Foreground, Is Rendered With The Nicest Truth. After This We Should Rank The Serpentine Rocks, Kynance Cove, Cornwall 309, By The Same Painter. Lfr. Philp Ve Should Take, From His Choice Of Subjects And Method Of Working, To Be A Pupil Of Mr. Cook, And Our Worst Objection To Him Is That His Drawings Look Too Much Like Inferior Reproductions Of Hismasters Designs. In Figure-Subjects The Exhibition Is Decidedly Weak. It Has Nothing To Compensate Us For The Absence Of Mr. Absolon, Who Has, We Believe, Dedicated Himself To Oil Painting. But We May Signalize, Not Without Satisfaction, The Appearance Of Mr. Wehnert, Formerly A Contributor Of Figure Subjects Of A Seriousness Of Aim Unusual On These Walls, If Not Always Successful, In A New Character, As The Painter Of Some Very Clear, Careful, And Unexaggerated Little Views Of Florentine Architecture -Two Especialiy, A View Of The Uffizii From The Ponte Vecchio, And A View Of The Ponte Vecchio From The Ufflizwi 299 And 310, Of A Merit Altogether Out Of Proportion With Their Minute Diinensions. Mr. Tidey Does His Best To Replace Lmr. Absolon In A Large Drawing Of A4 Field-Day In The Last Century, In Which,With Considerable Grace And Prettiness Of Colour, There Is A Want Of Completencss Which Shows That The Artist Is Not Quite Up To. The Work He Has Attempted. Le Is Seen To Betteradvantage In A Study Called Idleness 46, Whicht Has Character And Ease.

Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1906-Oct-23,"London, England","Art Exhibitions. A Strong Personal And Pathetic Interest Attaches To Tiro Exhibition Which Opens To-Day At The Grafton Galleries, For Itconsists Of The Nearly Complete Works Of The Late Archibald Stuart Wortley. When He Died Just A Ycar Ago, After A Long And Distressing Illness, A Large Circle Of Friends Mourned A Genial Companion, A Brilliant Sportsman, And Au Eager Artist. As An Artist He Will Here Bo Judged But It Is Well To Remember, As One Studies These 70 Or 80 Pictures, That Ho Was Also Much More. He Was Extremely Versatileperhaps It Would Have Been Better For Him, And For His Fame, Had He Not Been So Had Bo Not Been Bora Of A Distinguished Family,With Early Opportunities Of Making Himself One Of Tho Finest Shots In England. Perhaps He Would Have Been A Better Artist If He Had Never Gone To Eton And Oxford, And If Instead He Had Gone To An Art School At 16 And Plodded His Way Upwards Through The Regular Course Of Classes And Studios. As It Was, Millais Took Him Up When He Was Three Or Fear And Twenty, And Ho Underwent Apparently No Other Artistic Influence. His Master Taught Him A Good Deal, And Now And Then, As In The Portraits Of His Brother And Mother Especially The Latter, Which Is Tho Finest Thing Hero, Ho Painted A Portrait Which Might Almost Pass For A Good Millais. As He Went On, The Modem Tendency To Paint Ugly Pictures As Examples Of Artistic Power Drove Him Into A Kind Of Sharp Antagonism. He Insisted Upon The Need Of Tthikrng Pictures Beautiful And Attractive And This, In The Case Of An Artist Who Fails Short Of First-Rate Power, Is Apt To Lead To The Painting Merely Of Pretty Faces Aud Smooth Surfaces, And To A Neglect Of Atmosphere, Tone, And Other Elements Which Are None The Less Essential To A Fine Picture Because Tho Extremists Cultivate Them To The Exclusion Of All Else. Wortley Shared This Tendency, Aud Thus Came To Be Somewhat Disparaged By The Prevailing School, Both Among His Fellow Artists And Among Tho Critics. He Was Anre Of This Attitude On Their Part, And It Certainly Increased The Sense Of Disappointment Of Winch His Friends Were Conscious During The Latter Part Of His Life. Yet He Was As Zealous As Any Of Them For His Work And His Profession And The Fact That He Founded And Presided Over The Society Of Portrait Painters Must Be Remembered As A Proof Of His Influence And Energy. It Was Chiefly As A Portrait Painter That Ho Was Known In London, Though Scores Of Country Houses Possess Engravings After His Shooting Scenes, Of Which The Originals Aro Bore. They Are Marvellously Accurate Nobody Clso Has Ever Painted Grouse-Drives And Partridge-Drives With Such Fidelity And Such Truth Of Movement. The Portraits Include The Wellknown Full-Length Of The King When Prince Of Wales Lent By The Junior Carlton Dub, Ths Excellent Portrait Of The Latte Lord Devon In Advanced Age, The Pictures Of Mr. James Purdoy, Tho Gunmakor, And Of Dr. W. G. Grace, Which Everybody Remembers, And Some 40 Pictures Of Ladies. Sometimes, As In The Portrait Of That Venerable Lady Ths Late Mrs. James Stuart Wortley, The Artist Rises To A Redly Considerable Height And He Is Always Successful In His Decorative Scheme, While His Drawing Is Never At Fruit. Two- Such Pictures As Those Of Mrs. Gore S3 And Thehon. Mrs. Edward Stuart Worthy 86 Arc Undoubtedly Very Attractive And When Time Has Mellowed Them They Will Be Thought To Have Been Better Worth Doing Than Many Of The Pseudo-Whistlers Now In Fashion. Another Exhibition Of A Memorial Character Is That Of The Works-Of The Late W. Evelyn Osborn, At Mr. Patersons Gallery, 5, Oldbond-Street. This Artist, Who Died Lately In His-Early Prime, Had A Delicate Colour Sense And A Channing Gift Of Composition In Landscape. His Studies Of Ths Thames St Battersea Are Of High Merit. Mr. A. W. Bichs Water-Colours At Tbs Carfax Gallery Are Perhaps Hardly So Satisfactory Ns The Drawings Which He Showed At Tbs Alpin Club A Year Or Two Ago But They Are Masterly Studies, More Or Less In The Manner Of Do Wint, End Their Variety Reflects The Variety Of Nature Herself. Mr. Rich Is In High Fashion At The Moment, Because He Realizes With Apparent Cose Those Tones End Values Which Modern Students Are Taught To Regard Os The One Tiling Needful. But In One Matter, Which Wo Should Regard As Quite Equally Essential, Ho Falls Far Behind His Exemplar. Do Wint Would Never Havo Allowed The Formless And Impossible Trees That Appear In Some Of The Drawings. The Pastels Of Mr. Frank Dean And Mr. T. W. Hammond At The Fino Art Societys The Small Drawings By Mr. Baghot De.Fr Bero At The Bruton Galleries Aud Mrs. Mary Mcevoys Works At The Che Nil Gallery, In The .Kings-Roed, Are Noticeable Among The Minor Exhibitions.

Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1931-Jan-03,"London, England","Art Exhibitions E - The Pastel Society If Wce Were Pastel Wve Should Be Inclined To Resent The Insistence-Both In Ptactice And In The Note To The Catalogue Of The Thirty-Second Exchibition Of The Pastel Society At The New Burlington Galleriesupon The Hard-Wearing Qualities Of The Medium. It Is As If It Vere Said Of A Plhantom Of Delight That She Was A Very Worthy Wonian. In Ordinary Life There Is Sometlung To Be Said For This Over-Subtle Flattery. As Wlheni A Bishop Is Complimented Uponl His Ping-Pong,-Implying That His Episcopal Merits Leap To The Eye-But In Matters Of Art It Is Better To Vaunt Essentials. Pastel Will Do All Sorts Of Things, And It Will Last, So To Speak, For Ever, But It Undoubtedly Has A Special Turn For Slight And Charming Effects. One Consequence Of A General Insistence Upon Thc Incidental Merits Of Pastel Is That At The Exhibition Of The Pastel Society You Are Torn Between Creditable Works Whieh Reduce The Medium To A Drudge, And Less Good Pictures Whichl Really Dq Give Pastel Its Fling. Mr. J. Mielutr-E Hamiltons Pretty Ladies-Like The Sheeps Conversation In The Poem-Are Not Very Deep, But They Illustrate One Of The Happiest Uses Of Pastel In Their Swvift, Light Handling And Delicate Schemies Of Colour. Thev Make .Nost Of The Other Things Look Laboured. For A Fuller Treatment-Lir. Hamilton Lets The Brown Paper Ground Have A Good Deal To Say In The Effect-We May Turn To Trinkets, By Miss Anna Airy, W.Hicll, Tlhough It Is Rathler Obvious In Colour, Shows The Broad And Vigorous Touch That The Pastel Stick Allows To Perfection. One Oddity To Be Noticed In The Exhibition Is That, When An Artist Does Wake Up To A Special Quality In Pastel, Lie Is Apt To Use It In Foreing Colour In A Meahistic Convention. This Is Noticeable In The Landscapes By Ilir. Leonard Richmond. The Colours Are Not Neeessarily Too Bright In Themselves There Is No Limit To Pitchi Of Colour In A Decorative Effect But They Are Too Bright For That Kind Of Picture-Though Lovemnent, Of Wind And Wvater, Has Its Attractions. As A Whlole, However, The Exhibition Looks Better Than Former Ones Of The Series-Partly Because It Is Better Hung. Nothing Could Be More Estimable Than The Studies Of Tlle Cornish Coast By Mr. A. L. Baldry, But The Medium In Them Is Ruled With A Rod Of Iron. One Thinks Of The Reformed Rake. As A Result One Tuins A Lenient Eye Upon Such Things As Mr. Francis Blacks Gardens, Catherine, Working On The Terrace, By Mrs. Laura Anning Bell, Romance, Bv Mr. Miontague Smyth, Girls Head, By Mrs. P4. A. Eastlake, And A Canal-Venice, By Mr. Terrick Williams. They Are Not Such Estimuable Pictures, But They Sing.

(FROM OUR VIENNA CORRESPONDENT.),International Exhibition Of Photography,The Times,1891-May-22,"London, England","Intdibn Ational Exhibition Of Photogbaphy. Fitom Ou1. Vienna Cornespondent. The International Exhibition Of Artistic Photographs Organized By Tho Vienna Club Of Amateur Photographers Was Opened Recently By The Archduchess Maria Theresa, In The Presence Of Many Distinguished Personages, Including Prince Philip Of Coburg, Sir Augustus Paget, And Several Austrian Cabinet Ministers. As The Official Titlo Of The Exhibition Denotes, The Exhibits Are Without Exception Such As Can Claim Really Artistic Value. How Rigorously The Selection Committee, Which Consisted Of Eminent Painters And Sculptors Of Various Nationalities, Went To Wyork May Be Judged From The Fact That Out Of 4.Oou Impressions Offered For Exhibition Only 600 Have Been Admitted. The Result Is, As Is Admitted On All Sides, An Admirable Collection Of Productions Of Modern Photography In Its Most Artistic Application. The Numerous British Photographers, Both Amateur And Professional, Who Are Nowv Exhibiting In Vienna Have Certainly No Reason To Regret Their Participation In This International Competition. It Is Not Too Much To Say That They Form The Great Attraction Of The Exhibition, And That Their Works Well Sustain The Superiority Of English Photography. The Ioenna Journals Frankly Admit That The Most Valuable Exhibits From An Artistic Point Of View Belong To British Photographers, And This Opinion Was Freely Expressed Auring The Opening Ceremony At The Austrian Museum, Where The Exhibition Is Being Held. Greatly Admired Was The M Ljan In Armour, By Arthur Burchett, Of London, As Well As The Landscapes And Natural Scenes By Robinson, Of Tunbridge Wells, And Harry Tolley, Of Nottingham. The Following Camo In For Much Praise -George Davison, Of London, Robert Dresser, Of Bexley Heath, Horsley Hinton, Of London, And Many Others. The English Colony In Vienna Is Represented By Mr. John Bergheim, Who Contributed A Capital Gipsy Family And A Portrait In Rembrandt Style. Next To The English Photographers A Foremost Rank Is Occupied By An Italian Lady, Countess Loridana, And Wilhelm Dreesen, Of Flensburg. Among The Vienna Amateurs May Be Mentioned The Barons Albert And Nathaniel Rothschild. The Patroness Of The Exhibition, The Archduchess Maria Theresa, As Well As The Princess Of Wales, The Grand Dule Ferdinand Of Toscana, And Count Bardi Have Exhibited Hors Conrcotrs. The Princess Of Wales Has Sent Some Small Instantaneous Photographs Which Are Declared By Experts To Belong To The Best Of Their Kind.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS218944694/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=bf8168e1,,

Perhaps It Means That The Chief Exhibitors Have Studied Abroad, And That The Dominant Influence Is French We Wish That We Could See More Signs Of The Best French Training, Especially In Drawtag But It Must Be Confessed That The Qualities Most In Evidence Are Those That Come From A Superficial Imitation Of French Colour And Tone.

Imagination And Humour Are Both Present In The Exhibition Of Drawings And Caricatures From The Sketch-Books Of Mr. Sidney H. Sime At The St. Georges Gallery, 32A, George-Street, Hanoversquare. Those Who Are Old Enough To Remember Pick-Me-Up With Gratitude Will Not Be Surprised To Learn That Mr. Simes Powers, If They Have Sobered, Have Deepened In Rural Retirement, Beeause It Was Evident Then That His Gift Was More Than Cleverness. The Best Things Here Are Small Imaginative Landscapes In Colour, Almost Always Most Impressive When They Are Unpeopled-Unless By Animals Only. The Blake-Ish Dragonshold, Shorehiam Hill, In A Rain Squall, Wastelands, And Wild Beast Wood, With Its Gliding Wolves, Are Examples. They Are True Interpretations Of Landscape Mood, And Technically They Are Beautiful, Done With Hatching Strqkes With The Point Of The Brush In Sober Schemes Of Colour. The Treatment In These Landscapes Is Comparatively Naturalistic, But Another Series, Including The Forest, Remote Landscape. And Moorland Lake, Shows That Mr. Sime Can Formalize In A Decorative Convention Without Losing Mood, And There Are Some Attractive Schemes In Pure Decorationnos. 77 And 79, For Good Examples.

In Their Sober And, So To Speak, Oldfashioned, Way, The Water-Colours Of The South Of France And Elsewhere By Mr. Adam Knight At Walkers Galleries, 118, New Bondstreet, Have Considerable Merit-Particularly When The Subjects Are Mainly Architectural. These Water-Colours, In Fact, Remind One Of The Sort Of Conversation Which Is Found On Consideration To Have More In It Than The Absence Of Contenmporary Smartness Miglht Lead One To Suppose. Mr. Knight Knows How To Compose A Subject, Lifr Execution, Though Slow, Is Sulticiently Broad, And His Colour Has That Truth In The Relations Which Makes For Solidity Of Effect. Place De La Mairie, Cagnes, A Pump In St. Tropez, Etaples, Montreuil, And St. Saulve, Montreuil Are All Good Examples Of Wlhat They Set Out To Be.

But From A Pictorial Point Of View The Best Things Are The Two Paintings Of Cornish Coast With Cattle, Nos. 13 And 21, And Such Landscapes As In The Woods And Hillsile Parni, Ospedaletti. A Severe Course Of Drawing And Restraint In Colour Are Indicated. Pictures Of India. The Water-Colour And Tempera Paintings Of Iiilia By Mr. W. S. Bagdatopoulos.

Work Of Three Banks Staffs The Lord Mayor Of London Sir George Broadbridge Yesterday Opened The First Three Banks Art Exhibition, Which Is Being Held At Guildhall. The Three Banks Which Are Associated With The Exhibition Are The Bank Of England And The Midland And Westminster Banks. Previously Individual Exhibitions Have Been Held, But This Year A Combined Exhibition Has Been Arranged, And There Are 427 Exhibits. Mr. Montagu Norman, Who Is President Of The Bank Of England Arts Society, With Mr. Stanley Christopherson Deputising For Mr. Mckenna, President Of The Midland Bank, Art Club, Conducted The Lord Mayor Round The Exhibition. Mr. Norman Said That The Midland Bank Had Had An Art Society For The Best Part Of A Dozen Years. The Westminster Bank Art Club Was Only Four Or Five Years Old Yet It Had Met With Great Success. The Bank Of England Society Had Had The Longest Life, But Had Not Had The Continuity Of The Others. It Had Occasionally Taken A Rest Off Duty For A Year Or Two. Laughter. They Valued The Exhibition Because It Stimulated The Life And Interest Of Those Who Worked In The Banks And Who Were Thus Enabled To Have A Hobby To Which They Could Devote Themselves.

Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1887-Jan-24,"London, England","Art Exhibitions. The Dudley Gallery Art Society Opens To-Day 2N Exhibition Of Water-Colours At The Egyptian Elail, Piccadilly. Since The Change Which Took Place Hero On The Establishment Of The Institute The Exhibitions Have Not Been Quite On The Level Which They Attained In The Old Times, But, As Collections Of Tho Work Of Amateurs Or Of The Younger Professional Artiststhey Have Been Respectable. The Present Display Is No Exception To This Rule. It Is Not Very Large, Containing Little Over 200 Works And, Without Comprising Any Drawing That Is Specially Remarkable, It Is Up To A Fair Standard Of Performance. Perhaps Thebest Work Here Is Tho Off Hastings 143 Of Mr. Francis Powell, Whoso Work At The Royal Water-Colour Society Is Well Known To All Who Care For Drawings Of The Sea. Miss Kate M,Acaulay Sends Three Or Four Drawings Of Fishing-Boats And Scenes Of The River And The Sea The Best Is Old Chelsea And Battersea Bridge 138, Which, Except For Being Somewhat Dull In Colour, May Be Called A Successful Rendering Of One Of The Most Picturesquo Bits Of London, Now, Unfortunately, Changed And Mado Commonplace By The, Necessities Of Time. Mfr. Alfred Easts Bit Of A Berkshire Common 122 And M1R. Claude Hayess Gipsy Life 188 Are Studies Which More Or Less Resemble One Another, And Each Is The Work Of An Artist. Among Views Of London Wo May Notice Tho River Pioces Of Mlr. Hubert Mledlycott, And The Trafalgar-Square 55 Of Miss Robertson And Among Flon-Er Pieces The Orchids 58 Of Miiss Helen Thornycroft Stands Out As An Example Of Delicato Colouring And Careful Painting. At 3Mr. Bassanos Gainsborough Gallery In Old Bond-Street There Is Now To Be Seen A Fiulllength Portrait Which Has Been Purchased By Sir Charles Aitchison For The Punjab Institute, Labore. The Occasion Of The Gift Is, Of Course, The Jubilee,Nd It May Be Admitted That The Picture Makes As Good A Jubilee Memorial As Most Others. Wvithout Having Any Very Great Artistic Pretensions, The Portrait Is Interesting As Showing What Can Be Done From Photographs For, Though Her Miajestyhas Seen The Picture And Suggested Certain Points In Its Composition, We Believe That It Has Heon Almost Entirely Painted From Mr. Bassanos Photographic Likeness. The Queen Is Represented Ceated, In Robes Of State, Wearing The Famous Flounce Of Venetian Lace, The Diamond Imperial Crown, The Koh-I-Noor, The Star Of Indin, C. Altogether It Will Give Her Majestys Indian Eubjects A Very Good Idea Of Her Appearance, And Will Always Remain A Pleasant Memorial Of The Jubilee. At The Hanover Gallery, At The Corner Of Mladdox-Street And New Bond-Street, A Good Many Additions Have Been Made To The Exhibition Since Last We Noticed It. Conspicuous Among These Is Carolus Durans Brilliant Childs Portrait, Called Bepino, A Work Which Shows All His Unquestionable Power -Without The Vulgarity Into Which He Too Often Falls.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS201509944/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=206274f4,,

The Chemistry Of Earth, Are. To Be Seen At The Galleries Of Miessrs. Bluett And Sons, 48, Davies-Street, Brook-Street, Where There Is A Collection Of Early Chinese Ceranics, Including Examples Recently Brought From China. There Are About 100 Pieces, Ranging From The Ean To The Early Fing Dynasty, Or From About 200 B.C.F To About 1400 A.D. In Our Reckoning So That The Collection As A Whole Illustrates The Progress Of Chinese Ceramic Art From Unglazed Through Glazed Pottery To True Porcelain In Which The Glaze And The Body Are Fused Into A New Substance. By Firing. Believed To Be Unique Are 12 Unglazed. Pottery Statuettes Of Reddish Clay Representing The Signs Of The Chinese Zodiac. These Are In The Form Of Human Figures With Animal Heads-Of The Rat, Ox, Tiger, Hare, Dragon, Snake, Monkey, And So On. Of The Tang Dynasty 618-906 A., They Are All In The Same Convention The Hands Of The Figures Being Folded At The Breast Under The Robe, Of Which The Lines Curve Downwards To Present The Appearance Of Closed Wings. This Gives To The Little Figures A Curious Dignity, An Effect Which Is Enhanced By The Suavity Of The Modelling-Though The Animal Character Ofthe Heads, Of The Snake, For Instance, Is Un- Cannily Suggested. - Included In The Collection Are A Few Bronzes, From Which The Forms Of The Potteries Were Often Imitated-Or, Rather, Translated. There Is One Small Bronze, Koro 16, Of The Tsing Period 265 Ad., With Handles, Beautifully Decorated, Encrusted With A Blue-Green Patina And Bearing Traces Of Gilt And Between This And A Tripod Incense Burner 90, Of The Sung Period 9601279, About The Same Size, An Interesting Comparison Can Be Made. The Form Is Roughly The Same, But In The Porcelain Version The Sharpness Of The Casting And Engraving Is Soothed Away, So To Speak, By The Fingers Of The Modeller. It Is A Translation, And Not A Soulless Imitation, Of The Bronze Form. This Piece, Found On The Site Of Lung Chuan, Has The Most Exquisite Glaze In The Collection, Of A Quality Impossible To Describe In Words, Though The Unctuous Of One Expert Will Suggest The Way It Reflects The Light And Feels To The Fingers. Compared With It Everything Else, Though There Are Many Excellent Pieces In Celadon, Notably A Figure With Unglazed Face And Hands 77, Slightly Glitters. A Feature Of The Collection Is A Set Of Fine Porcelain With A Delicate Blue Or Ying Ching. Glaze, Found In Northem China, And Belonging To A Ju Type. Among The Pieces Is A Deep Saucer With Radiating Lines In Relief 91, In The Conventionalized Form Of The Expanded Corolla Of A Flower. Though Differing In Colour And In The Number Of Petals, It Has The Effortless Perfection Of An Open Primrose. Otlier Things Of Note Are A Glazed Pottery Model Of A Horses Head, Of The Tang Period, But Startlingly Greek In Effect, And A Pottery Pillow Formed As A Crouching Boar.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS286856833/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=5a4b5520,,

As One Enters The Rooms Of The Fine Art Society In New Bond-Street One Is Delayed By Something Muh Better Worth Seeing Than Any Show Of Ephemeral Art Is Likely To Le-By A Collection Of Historical Documents And Autographs Of Real Importance. Who Is The Owner Of This Collection Of 244 Pieces Is A Secret, But, Whoever He May Be, He Has Succeeded In Bringing Together What Probably Is, Next To Mr. Alfred Morrisons, The Richest Assemblage Of Autographs In Private Hands In England. We Should Be Going Beyond The Scope Of This Article Were We To Describe These Mss. In Any Detail It Must Suffice To Say That They Includte Signatures, Letters, And The Original Mlanuscripts Of. Printedvworks, From The Hands Of Royal Personages, Great Statesmen, Authors, Painters, Musicians, C., For A Period Of Three Centuries Or More. To Mention But A Very Fewv, There Are Signs-Manual Of Henryvii., Elizabeth, Lfrancis I., Charles V. Letters From Elizabeth, Louis Xi., Henri Iv. Letters Of Burleigh And Of Many Other English Statesmen Down To Recent Times Of Mime. De Maintenon And Mme. De Pompadour, Of Coligny And Bossuet, Of Reynolds And Gainsborough, Of Burns And Cowper, Of Scott And Shelley Theautographmss. Of Endymion And Lamia, Of Southeys C Urse Of Kehama, And Of Mloores Epicurean The Original Drafts Of Many Of Sternes Most Famous Letters And, In A Very Different Field, A Whole Series Of Letters From .Napoleon. From These It Is Not Exactly An Ascent To Pass To The Water-Colours And Designs In The Further Rooms But These Things, Too, Are Interesting In Their Way. Messrs. Rheads Illustrations To The Pilgrims Progress Are Firmly Conceived And Drawn, Though A Little Conventional. Mrfr. H. S. Hopwood Is One Of The Newly-Made Associates Of The Old Water-Colour Society, And He Bids Fair To Do Credit To The Well-Established Reputation Of That Body. His Interiors And Markets In Normandy And Brittany Are Seen With The Eye Of An Artist, And Are Carefully And Intelligently Painted. The Artist Belongs, If To Any School, To That Of Fred Walker, Pinwell, And Professor Herkomer, Which Is As Much As To Say He Is Not An Impressionist. But He Is As Productive As If He Were His Output-Surely Not For A Single Year-Amounts To No Less Than 63 Drawings, Some Of Them Quite Elaborate. One Trembles To Think Of The Future If All The 5,000 Artists Working In England Are To Produce At That Rate. Messrs. Tooth, In The Elaymarket, Keep To Their Accustomed Lines, And Their Winter Exhibition Is One Of Cabinet And Other Works By Such En,Lish Painters A Messrs. Hemny Woods, Leader, Bseymour Lucas, David Farquharson, Blair Leighton, And James Orrock And By Tmm. Muiacsy, Domingo, Auguste Bonheur, Jacquet, Deutsch, C. Many Of These Are, Of Course, Extremely Accomnlished. Nothing Could, In Its Way, Be Better Than Mir. Seymour Lucass 17Th Century Figure, Thinking It Out -Very Brilliantly Painted, In His Buff Jarkin And Scarlet Cloak Or Than The Little Venetian Scenes Of Mr. Woods And Mr. Logsdail Or Than The Beautiful Early Work Of The Lamented Henry Moore, An Estuary, With Its Transparent Water And Threatening Sky. Of The Foreign Pictures, A Conspicuous Place Is Claimed By Mme. Di6Terle Van Mharkes Daughter For Her Cattle On The Coast -Very Clever And Competent, But Hardly Interesting Because Representing Rather What The Artist Has Been Taught Than What Shohaspersonallyobserved And Felt. A Better Painter Is The Neglected Auguste 1Bonheur, Whose Cows Are Really Almost As Brilliant As Troyons, Though He Has A Much Duller Feeling For Landscape. The Work Of Professor Scheurenberg Is New To England, Though The Painter Has A High Reputation In Berlin His Picture Of The Seas Delight Is Very English In Technique, And Is Not Wi.Thout Charm. - Next Door, At Mr. Mleans, The Place Of Honour Is Given To A Large Picture Painted By Nflle. Rosa Bonheur In L876, Uine Compagme De Sangliers -Life-Sized Wild Boars Making Their Way Through A Forest. The Boars Are A Surprisingly Exact Copy Of Nature, And The Landscape Is Something Rather Better. It Is Interesting To See Again Two Such Powerful Little Works Of J. L. Ger6Me As The Gladiatorial Figures, The Retiarivs And The Mnirmillo, Here Exhibitedmarvels Of Modelling And Painting, And Extraordinary Archaeological Creations. These Pictures Belong To The Epoch Of The Ave, Caesar, And Other Famous Pictures, When The Artist Was Finding The Source Of A Grim Inspiration In The Sports Of The Roman Amphitheatre. For The Rest, There Are Two Fine Examples Of Schreyer, Who Always Paints Well An Excellent Small Lhermite Mr. Flerkomers At The Well And Sweet Emma Moreland, One Of The Latest Works Of Millais. At Messrs. Dowdeswells, In New Bond-Street, Mr. F. E. Chardon Exhibits Some Clever Pastels Of Foreign Views, Chiefly Neapolitan. They Are, As The Phrase Goes, C Arried Far -Too Far For The Instrument, We Feel Disposed To Think For Here Pastel Trenches Somewhat Upon The Domain Of Water-Colour, And Attempts What Wat.R.Colour Would Perform Better.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS67952993/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=199c8ad9,,

Londons Atmosphere Is Always With Us, Hut We Never, 60Ow Fromday To.Day Wheri Some Characteristic Building-Such As St. John At Wapping-The Old Charity School -Is-To Come Down. The Work Of Mr. .Dacers Adams Is Erinently Static, Firmly Designed And Simplifed Down To, But Not Beyond, The Character Of The Building. And He Gives You The Intrinsic Colour Of, The Bricks And Stones Rather Than Their Accidental Effepts. His Planning Of-Shadows To Intensify The Look Of Solidity Is Remarkably Good, Waterloo Bridige Steps Beingi Wonderful In This Respect. With This Drawing May Be Namned St. Martins Church From The National. Gallery, And A Bit Of Somerset Eouse-Kings College In Rear.. A Few Oil Paintings Are Included, Silence, The Vaulted Interior Of A Church In Spain, Showing Mr. Dacres Adamss Capacity To Vork Out! The Gradation Of Light In An Alrehiteetural Subject. At Tbhe Same Galleries There Are Humorous Drawings By Mr. W. Heath Robinson.

Mr. Winslow Is A Good Designer, With A Fine Sense Of The Emotional Appeal Of Abstract Forms-Witness The Use Made Of The Arching Davit In The White Ship And Of The Bollard In Ihe Hawser-A Sensitive Draughtsman, And A Very Choice Colourist And His Practice Of Painting On Linen Enables Him To Dispense With Detail And Still Get An Interesting Quality From The Texture Of The Stuff. ,Shipping Provides Him With Some-Of His Best Material, And He Has Evident-Ly Studied It Until He Can Leave Out Everything Which Does Not Count Aesthetically. Blackwall, With Its Remarkable Depth Of -Atmosphere, Is His -Best Watercolour, - But The Aberdonian,- A Cunard- Liner, And A Farm Have Speeial Qiiualitis, And There Is Admnirable Perspective Drawing In The Red Barge.

This Truttlh In Terms Of The Imediulml Is Not The Whole Of Art, Whichl, Like Poetry Or Imiusic, Must Be, Judged Finally As Comuposition, But It Is A Good Beginning. It Mlakes Art Possible. Thiere Is. Of Course, Another Kinrd Of Tlutlh To Natture, Literal Or Irmitative Truthl, Regardless Of The Medium, And It Is Prevalent In This Exhibition. But It Lands You In An Awkwaicl Predicament. If It Is Accepted As The Basis Of Art You Have To Agree That Many Of The Vworks In The Exhibition Are Better Than Anything Produced Bv Any Of The Old Masters. Rembrandt, For Instance, Never Painted Anvthing So True To Nature In The Imitative Sense As Mrs. George Sutton, By Mr. P. A. Has-, And There Are Several Landscapes Wlhich, By Tile Same Standard, Leave Constable Out Of The Running. It Is Possible, Of Course, That 3Mr. Hay And The Artists Responsible For The Landscapes Ar E Better Artists Than Rembrandt And Constable, But It Seems More Likely That The Kind Of Trutlh In Which They Excel Is Not The Kind That Rembrandt And Const-Able Were Aimiing At. Which Is The Better Kind Of Truth In The Abstract Need Not Be Argued It Is Enough To Say That Truth In Terms Of The Mediunm, Wlich Allows, If It Does Not Compel, Departures From Literal Or Iritative Truth, Seems To Have Been Historically Preferred For Artistic Purposes. If, Instead Of A Painting, You Think Of A Pen Drawing By Rembrandt, The Difference Between The Two Kinds Of Truth Is All The More Apparent. At Any Rate It Is In The Belief That Trutb In Teirns Of The Mediumt Is The More Suitable For Artistic Purposes That This Notice Is Written, And For That Reason-As Well As For Its Graceftul Movement- Dutch Shrimpers, By Miss Miary Meccrossan, Is Preferred To Anything Else In The Exlhibition-Allowing, Of Course, That In An Exhibition Of Nearly 600 Woorks It Is Easy To Overlook Little Masterpieces. The Kind Of Truth Preferred In Water-Colour Is Not, By The Way, Limited To One Style, For Thele Are Several Excellent Things In The Exhiibition That Are Drawings Rather Than Paintings. To Make A Short List Of Works That, In One Way Or Another, Seem To Take Account Of The Medilum In Their Efforts At Truth To Nature There Are Watergate Street, Chester, By Mr. Leonard Squirrcl, A Cup Of Tea, By Miss M. Grace Mead, Colliers End, Herts, By Mir. Alfred H. Hart, Winter Sunshine, Winchelsea, By Mir.

Null,Art Exhibitions,The Times,1923-Dec-01,"London, England","-Art Exhibitions.-- Dutch Tiles. The Victoria And- Albert Museum Opens To The Public To-Day An Exhibition Of The Dutch Tiles From The Vis Collection Which Have Been Presented To The-Natioh By Mr. Henry Van Den Bergh Through The National Art-Collections Fund. The Guide-Catalogue Written By Mr. Bernard Rackham Post Free, 10D. Will Be A Great Help To Many In The Enjoyment Of These Fine Specimens Of A Peculiar, Sometimes Beautiful, Sometimes Amusing, Nearly Always Pleasing Art. The Tiles Are Arranged Pretty Nearly In Chronological Order And With The Help Of The Guide We Can Trace The Development From The Tiles Of The Later 16Th Century, When The Art Frst Came To The Low Countries From Italy, To Be Reinforced Later By Influence From Spain, Down To The Later Part Of The 18Th Century. The Earliest Dutch Tiles Were Not Units Their Geometrical And Arabesque Designs, In Blue, Yellow, Brown, And Occasionally Green, In A White Pattern On A Dark Ground, Cannot Be Seen Until At Least Four Are Put Together. The Story Then Becomes That Of The Shrinking Of The Corner Ornament, Until Each Tile Tended To Become A Unit The Coming Of Naturalism In Design, To Replace The Early Formal Conventional Patterns And Very Beautifully Some Of The 17Th-Century Artists Represented Tulips, Or Fritillaries, Or Ships, Or Animals First The Enlargement Of The Colour Scheme,Then Its Gradual Falling-Back Upon Monotone, Either Blue Or Manganese Purple And Then The Treatment Of Tiles As A Field For The Reproduction Of Painted Pictures Or Engravings, Or As Occasions For Original Pictorial Treatment On A Large Scale. All These Periods Are Well Illustrated In Mr. Van Den Berghs Gift, In Which The Tiles Are Never Shown Separately, But Always In Groups. The Dutch Use Of Tiles For The Decoration Of Walls Rather, Than For Floor-Coverings Encouraged, No Doubt, Delicacy And Variety In Treatment And It Is Of Great Interest To Trace Their Development Here From The Rich Formality Of The Earliest Kind To The Exquisite Grace And Fineness Of The 17Th-Century Naturalistic Designs, Thence To The Individually Pictorial Scenes From The Bible, Marine Studies, Shipping Scenes, And The Like, And So On To The Big Pieces Of Many Tiles, Where The Art Declines Through Forgetting Its Origin And Peculiarity. Vincent Van Gogh. The Leicester Galleries Have Secured For Exhibition A Remarkable Collection Of Paintings And Drawings By One Of The Most Remarkable Artists Of The Last Century, Vincent Van Gogh. The Story Of Van Goghs Unhappy Life And Dreadful Death Is Known To Many People But English Lovers Of Art Have Not Before Had The Chance Of Seeing So Large And So Representative A Show Of His Work As This. It Begins With Drawings I And 4, For Instance Admirably Done In The Old Style In The Early Eighteen-Eighties. It Ends Nith The Strange, Frenzied, Whirling Work Of The Last Days In Provence, And In The Asylum At Saint-Remy See No. 34, And The Last Days Of All, At Auvers-Suroise No. 39. And In Between It Shows All The Stages In The Galloping Development Of An Art That Leaped From Aim To Aim And Covered Half-A-Centurys Effort In A Decade An Art That Was A Forerunner And An Influence Hard To Over-Estimate. Van Gogh Is Wel Described By Sir Miichael Sadler In The Catalogue As Preachingfriar Turned Painter. There Is The Same Missionary Zeal In His Painting As There Was. In His Youthful Preaqhing To. The Belgian Miners Of La Borinrge, One Can Trace His Rapid Course From Clarity And Certainty 15, 18, 31 Through Triumphant But Aspiring Conviction. 21, 24, 26 To Spiritual Regions Where He Cannot Easily Be Followed, Regions Where The Definition Of A Straight Line Has Disappeared 39 And He Sees Even A Cypress Tree-To Most Of Us The Very Symbol Of Quiet Certainty And Resigned Confidence-As A Wild Thing Of Spirals And Whorls And Flames 5. It Is Not To Be Supposed That In These Chamois-Like Leaps From Peak To Peak He Always Came To The Rest Of Full Achievemient Bult In Many Of These Pictures There Are The Triumph And .The Beauty Seldom Lacking Some Sort Of Humour Of The Thing Done. Such Are, Especially, Nos. 21, The Portrait Of His Friend, Roulin, The Arles Postman 24, Berceuse, The Postmans Wife, Painted, As Van Gogh Declared, Like A Shop Chrornolithograph, Because It Was Meant For The Iceland Fishermen, At Once Children And Martyrs 25, His Bedroom At Arles A,D, Most Brilliantly Beautiful Of All, 26, One Of The Paintings Of Sunflowers, That He Meant To Put Together As Decoration For The Studio He Was To Share With Gauguin. It Is A Little Ill-Luck, Perhaps, For Mir. E. M. Or. Dickey That He Has An Exhibition In A Room Adjoining That Given To This Giant. On The Other Hand, It May Help To Bring Out All That Is Individual In The Work Of A Young Painter Who Vcry Distinctly Has Style, A Kind Of Quiet Aristocracy Of Vision, And A Suppleness Of Palette And Touch That Makes Him Always And Variously Interesting. Dlesign And Colour In Mr. Dickeys Wvork Are Appropriate And Authentic And In These Landscapes Of Italy, Sussex, And London He Conspicuously Lets The Painting Do Its Own Work, Only Now And Then As In The Painting Of The Railway Lines At Eentish Town, 25 Attempting To Excite Us By Emphasis On Subject. Tee Society Of Wood Engravers. Mr. Dickcy Is One Of The Many Artists Who Contribute To A Striking Little Exhibition Of Wood-Cuts By The Society Of Wood Engravers At .The St. Georges Gallery, 32A, George-Street, Hanoversquare. The Capital Feature Of The Show Is The 10 Woodcuts By Gauguin, Engraved In His South Seas Period, But Only Recently Printed From Blocks In Possession Of His Son. Polynesian, Mystical, Profound, They Strike One As The Woodeuts Of As Painter But Their Veryz Discovery Is An Ev Ent, And Their Artistic Merit Will Be Hotly Discussed. Next To These In Interest We Should Put The Many Masterly Wood Engravings By Mr. John J. A. Mfurphy, Whose Method Is To Cut In The Block Lines Which In The Print Will Be Whzite, And Who More Than Any Other Of The Exhibitors Here Convinces One That He Was Indeed Engraving With A Tool Upon A Block Of Wood. Mr. Eric Gill, Also A True Woodengraver, Sends Some Beautiful Things And Among Other Exhibitors In A Show That No One Who Cares For These Things Must Miss Are Mr. Gordon Craig, Mr. Paul Nash, Mr. John Nash, Miss Gwendolen Raverat, Mr. Robert Gibbings, Mlr. Ethel. Bert White, Mr. Claughton Pellevo, Mr. Lucien Pissarro, And Miss Elinor Lambert.

Probably No Other Quarter Of London Could Provide A Similar Exhibition In Which Historical And Artistic Interest W-Ould Be So Nicely Balanced And Wvhen We Lemember The Namnes Of Turner, Rossetti, Whistler, Eevmour Haden, And R3Argent In The Past-Though Turner, Rossetti, And Largent Do Not Happen To He Repiesented Here-And Mr. Wilson .Iteer, Mr. Frank Brangwyn, Mr. Walter Greaves, And Mllss Ethel Walker In The Piesent, And Also Recau The Fame Of The Cbelsen Porcelain Factory Under Nicholas Sprimont, The Advantages Of Chelsea In This Respect Are Easily Explained.

In This Connexion We Cannot Forbear Quoting The Words Of Tho Late Tr. Clutton-Brock In The Timncs In His Notice Of The Exhibition Which Startled London In May, 1911- Whbistler Definies Only For The Sake Of His Design. Mr. Greiivai Defines Because He Loves Every Timber In Flhe Bridge An Yet Hlis Design Is Almost As Fine As Vhistlers And Almost As Predoniinant.

These Drawings-Which Are For Sale-And The Photographs Of Old Chelsea Taken Between 1860 And 1870, By J. Hedderlev, Are Perhaps The Niost Valuable Part Of The Exhibition. This Is Not To Say That The More Purely Artistic Exercises By Living And Recent Artists Will Not Serve A Similar End By Different Means, And In Looking At Thie Thames, Chelsea, By Cecil Lawson, New Battersea Bridge, By Charles Conder, Evening Chelsea Reach, By Mr. Wv.

Somebody Once Said That 31. Andrei Dunoyer De Segonzac, To Gixve Him His Full Name, Whose Paintings. Drawings. And Etchinigs Fill Both The Alpine Chb Gallery, 3Mill-Street, Conduit-Street. Atnd The 1Idependenit Gallery, Gcrafton-Strect, Paints Like A Lauded Proprietor, And There Is A Considerable Amount Of Truth In The Jesl That Is To Say, M. -Segonzac Paints Landscape With The Extragartistic Understanding Which Is Commoner In England Than In France, As Well As With The Artistic Understanding Which Is, On The Whole, Commoner There Than Here. At The Alpine Club Gallery, Where The Oil Paintings Are Assembled, You Havea Pronounced Feeling Of Tweeds, Thick Boots-Not Without Soil Upon Them-Pipes, And Dogs At Your Heels. At The Same Time It Would Be Straining The Truth To Say That M. Segonzac Paints Like An Englishman He Paints Rather As You Feel An Englishman Ought To Paint If He Combined With His Love Of The Country A French Feeling For Pictorial Order And It Is Not Extravagant To Say That, In His Contentment With Large, Simple Masses And A Limited Range Of Colour, There Is A Certain Atfinity Between M. Segonzac And John Crome. Though He Does Not Disdain Trees, He Is Pre-Eminently A Painter Of Earth. Largeness Of Design And Robustness Of Handling Are The Thiigs That Strike You First In The Oil Paintings. With A Similar Number Of Pictures The Alpine Club Gallery Has Never Looked So Completely Furnished. It Is Likely That M. Segonzacs Handling, Much Of It Done With The Palette Knife, Will Be The Difficulty Wvith People Who Come To Him For The First Time But When It Is Observed That The Paint, Though Thick And Rough, Is Well Organized And Supremely Well Related In Scale Of Handling To The Size Of The Picture, What Was A Barrier May Well Become A Link To Syinpathy. Particularly When There Is Felt The Uncommon Consistency As Between The Colour And The Substance Of Pigment Which Is One Of The Most Characteristic Virtues In The Work Of M. Segonzac. Since Chardin, And Our Own Morland, One Cannot Think Of Any Other Painter Who Puts You On Such Comradely Terms-More Masculine Than The Terms Induced By M. Matisse-With The Actual Materials Of Which Pictures Are Made. The Paintings Are Not All Landscapes, Hut Inclulde Figure And Still-Life Compositions, But It Is Probable That The Landscapes Will Have The Most General Appeal. For One Thing-And It Is By No Means Unimportant In The Actual As Distiiet Froni The Theoretical Appreciation Of Art-.Nost Of Them Induce The Feeling Of Comfortable Weather Mild, Moist Weather, With A South-Westerly Wind, If Any, When Colours Deepen And There Are Earthy Scents In The Air. Like Everybody Else Of His Age-He Was Born In 1884-M. Segonzac Has Responded To The Influence Of Cezanne, But More Than Most He Has Embodied The Influence In His Own System Of Painting. His Designs Are Completely Clothed. The General Development To Be Noted Is That From A Brown Tonality To The More Positive Hues Of Nature, But Always With The Sacrifice Of Minor Variations In Favour Of A Simple Scheme. If Individual Landscapes Nmst Be Named. Wve Should Pick Out La Ferme Dans Les Terres And Paysage Aux Toits Rouges, Among The Earlier, And Le Pont De Joinville, No. I,, La Foret, And Paysage De Provence, Among The Later, As Representing M. Segonzac At His Best. Each Of These Pictures Would Lend Itself To Elaborate Analysis, But It Will Be More To The Point To Give A Few Words To Les Canotiers. A Large Composition Of Landscape With Figures, Because It Seems To Hint A New Development. Strongly Side-Lit, And With A Very Active Movement In The Direction Of Its Lines, It Is Emotional In A New Way-By Direct Attack Rather Than By Conveyance. It Is An Agitating Composition, And Those Xvho Saw The Work Of M. Dutfresne At The Lefevre Galleries Will Feel In It A Certain Affinity With The Work Of That Painter. But With The Weightier Control Peculiar To M. Segonzac. This Picture Also Points The Wisdom Of Not Neglecting The Drawings At The Independent Gallery. Because There Will Be Founid Among Them Several Studies, All More Or Less Different, For The Figures In The Canoe. They Show How Thoroughly M. Segonzac Prepares Himself For His Attack Upon The Canvas, And There Are Other Drawings- Les Tartanes And Le Couple Are Good Examples-Which.Show That He Can Be Graceful As Well As Robust. Owing To Misinformation. In The Notice Of His Exhibit-Ion At The Brook-Street Art Galleriee In The Times Of 3Jay 30 Mr. F. Lenhart Was Described As A Swiss Artist Of Austrian Descent.

Hardinarn In St. Peters Church, Huarlmersnith, Xvhich L Ere Unveiled On May 18 By Sir George Clausen, R.A. Details Of The Gift And Dedication Avere Given In The Timles Of May 19. Like The Regency-Square Named After It St. Peters Is An Interesting Building, Dating From 1829. The Name Of The Architect Is Wvanting, But The Church, With Its Ionic Colonnade At The West Front, Bears A Famiily Resenmblance To St. Peters, Eaton-Square, Designed By Hakewill And Consecrated In 1827, And St. Peters, Wvalvorth-Road, Designed By Soane And Completed About 1825. It Is Planned In The Wren Tradition Of A Sermon Hall, With A Gallery And No Chancel, And It Is Remarkable Architecturally For The Wide Span Of The Panelled Ceiling, Which Is Suspended From The Roof Timbers. Under The Advice Of The Late Sir W. B. Richmond, R.A., The Church Wvas Re-Decorated Some Tinme Ago Iii A Scheme Of Buff And Dull Pink, Running Down The Scale To A Reddish Brown. In All That Concerns Relation To The Building And The Colour Scheme Indicated, And In General Composition, The Wall Paintings Are Excellent. They Are Carried Out For The Most Part In Light Tints, Preserving The Surface Of The Wall But Giving A Sufficient Suggestion Of Depth. The Subjects, The Call Of St. Peter And St. Peter Preaching On The Day Of Pentecost, Are Well Illustrated, Without Being Made Unduly Dramatic. On The Whole The Landscape And Architectural Surroundings Strike One As Being Better Thani The Figures, Wliich Might With Advantage Have Had A More Formal Style Of Drawing-More, For A Rough And Ready Illustratiol, Of The Style Of The Raphael Cartoons. The Desire To Avoicd A Conventional Interpretation Of The Subjects Is Understandable. Butsilnce There Is No Attempt To Translate Them Into Couteinhiorary Terms-The Artistic Convention Suggested By The Classical Character Of The Buildinig Wvould Have Been The Right Onie. It Is For General Conception, Colour Scheme And Relation-With Admirable Modesty And Restraint-To The Effect Of The Interior As A Whole That The Paintings Are To Be Praised. Walkers Galleries Of The Water-Colour Drawings Of Flowers And Landscape By Miss Katharhiie Cameron At Walkers Galleries, 118, New Bond-Street, It Can Be Said That They Show, First Of. All, Complete Sympathy With Their Subjects. Flowers, In -Particular, Are Treated By Miss Cameron With A Tender Humour Which Makes Her Work Immediately Recognizable. In Addition, She Lhas Taste And Judgment In Arrangement-Niaking The Design Suit The Character Of The Flowers-And An Exceedingly Good Style Of Water-Colour Painting. Her Flower Studies In This E-Hibition Divide Themselves Roughly Into Three Classes Coloured Drawvings, Putting The Emphasis Uponi Botainical Structure Anid Decorative Arrangement Paintings Which, Though They Are In Colour, Are Conceived Priinarily As Exercises In Tone And Works In Full Colour, Comisidered For Decorative Effect. Personally We Greatly Prefer The First Class, And The Chief Pleasures For Us In The Exhibition Are In Such Studies As Flowers Of April, Vildflowers Of September, And Bluebells Of Scotland Ii. Next Come The Studies In Toiie, With Their Effect Of Reserve And Mystery, Such As White Roses, Hoiieysuckle Ii., And September Rose. Less To Our Taste Are The Paintings, Mostlv Of Roses, In Full Colour-Not Because The Colours Are Too Bright, In Thenmselves, But Because They Seem To Escape Comparatively From The Control Which Distinguishes The Tone Studies. But Allowrance Must Be Made For Every Kind Of Taste, And Flowers Of February In Mediaeval British Jug Is A Gallant Thing. In Landscape One Is Aware Of Miss Camerons Powers As A Drauglitswomani. Here Again There Is A Tendency-Is It A Scottish Characteristic ?-Of Brighter Colours To Get Out Of Hand, And Preference Goes To Works Like The Old House At Bignor And Moonrise Behind St. Giles, Edinburgh. At Tle Same Galleries There Is An Exhibition Of Paintings By Mr. Tom Van Oss And Conimander Denis Fildes. Hung Together, They Are Strongly Contrasted In Style, Illr. Van Oss Being Broad And Loose In His Methods, Reflecting Continental Inifluences, While Commander Fildes Seems To Niodel Himself On The English Marinie Painters Of The Eighteenth Century. Apart From Anything Else, The Contrasts Aiid Occasional Correspondences In This Exhibition Are Most Amusing. As A Figure Painter Mr. Van Oss Excels In An Informal Kiiid Of Portraiture, And Earl Grey And His Daughters Playing Chess At Howick Is One Of His Best Pictures. But All His Work Has An Attractively Free-And-Easy Manner, With Great Variety Of Subject And A Vivid Realization Of Light. As A Composition Quai Comnbet, Villefranche, Leaves Little To Be Desired.

Spink And Son, King-Street. St. Jamess, As Highly Tinished Might Convey A Wrong Impression, Beeause They Are Anything But Laboured. They Are Finished, Rather, In The Sense Of Being Completed, By Extreme Seleetion Beforehand Of What To Paint And A Method Of Execution Which Is At The Same Time Subtle And Deliberate. They Give The Impression That From The First Conception Of The Subject The Artist Knows Exactly Where The Last Touch Is To Be Laid And Touch Is Added To Touch With A Delicate Precision Which Leaves Nothing To Be Smoothed Away. Mr. Bishop, Who Is Best Known By. His Paintings Of The White-Walled Cities And Villages Of North Africa, Has An Exquisitely Fine Sense Of Relations Of Both Forms And Colour Values, And It Is In His Management Of Them That The Charm Of His Pictures Chiefly Resides. A Street In Carrara And Red Palace Are Not The Best Pictures In His Exhibition, But They Have A Special Interest As Showing His Capacity To Make The Most Of Very Simple Material. In The Former.The Picture Is Made By The Nice Relation Of The Pink House To The Grey On One Side And The Buff On The Other, And By The Relation Of The Window Openings And The Angle Of The Kerb To The Oblong Of The Picture Area In The Latter It Is The Exact Width Of The Canal And The Direction Of The Causeways Which Makes The Difference Between A Mere Representation And A Picture. These Fine Adjustments, Though Not So Obviously, Are To Be Traced In All His Work. One Would Be Inclined To Sav That The Most Elaborate Of Mr. Bishops Paintings, Ei Early Morning In Tetuan, Was Also The Best, Because In It The Relations And Adjustments Are Carried Out In A Condition Of Light Which Demands An Almost Breathless Attention Bv The Painter, But Between The Walls, The Ferrv. Rabat, And Mouth Of The Thames Run It Very Close Indeed. Perhaps The Best Tribute To The Work Of Mr. Bishop Is That, At A First Glance, It Makes The Two Portraits By Mir. Augustus John. Miss Iris Tree And Amiss Pettigrew, Which Are Hung With It, Look Rather Coarse And Crude And It Needs A Readjustment Of The Vision To See That The Effect Is Due Only To More Emphatic Statement And A Larger Scale Of Intervals In The Painting.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS202840953/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=45192f95,,
