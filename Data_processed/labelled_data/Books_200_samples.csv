A PRIEST'S TRAG'EDY.
THE WMON AND PXST. By
GRAZmA DELEDDA. (Jonathan Cape. 6s. net.)
Miss Mary G. Steegmnnn's translation of Grazia Deledda's novel "" La Madre "" is excellently done, so far as smoothness and accuracy go. She has hardly succeeded, however, in reproducing the effect which Signora Deledda's stories achieve in their original tongue, especially in the dialogue, where, without using dialect excessively, the simple but passionate souls of the Sardinian villagers stand-vividly before the reader.
A translation, unless it be the work of a genius, seems to hang a tissue of alien mentality in front of simplicity like this which deadens its vibrations. This swift and tragic tale, the action of which is laid in the remote village of Aar in Sardinia, has three main characters: Paul the young priest, his old mother, and the well-to-do young woman Agnes who lives alone in the big house. Old Maria Elena has brought up her son to be a priest on her savings as a servant. He had grown up remote from the world, thinking only of the holy mys,teries, and, after his consecration, had been welcomed a9S a saint in his mother's native village, long benighted. There he had passed seven calm years, during which ""he thought of himself as having already lived his life, as having known all it could offer, *-isery, humiliation, love, pleasure- and expiation; as having withdrawn from the world like some-old hermit, and waiting only for the Kingdom of God.""
Instead, he was an innocent, young man of twenty-eight who suddenly was caught by the beauty of earthly passion. His mother, whose life he was, sits despair. ing in the presbytery as the story opens. The struggle comes to its climax and ends in the two days of the story's action. Having sworn to his mother on his return that night that he will not see Agnes again, Paul passes two nights and a day of torment. Very sldlfully Grazia Deledda shows him moving in silent agony against the background of village life, reading the Gospel over an . epileptic child, taking the viaticum to an old huntsman in his miountain hut, and counselling hisboysaeristan Antiochusan adorable character. There is a second meeting with Agnes, drawn with great power, in which the strength of the girl's single heart is grander than the weakness of a soul divided between love and conscience. She threatens to expose him at the early Mass. The Mass begins, and she is there. All three are in the little church: the spiritual conflict is intense. But Agnes falls kneeling at the altar rails, and the eyes of the old mother are darkened for ever. She had died of the grief and the terror that her son had overcome. It is a moving tragedy, but neither in English nor in Plrotestant England can such a tragedy make its fullest appeal.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS269030052/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=d50ed088,"New novels. A tortoiseshell cat was chasing a dead leaf. And the poor man. By Grazia del Sol. Jonathan Cassavetes. Not yet. Miss Mary G. Stanton's translation of Gloria del Sol's novella La Misericordia is excellently done, so far as smoothness and accuracy go. She has hardly succeeded, however, in reproducing the effect which the Veronique del Sol stories achieve in their original language, especially in the dialogue, where, without using excessive dialect, the simple but passionate souls of the Sardinian villagers stand-in for the reader. A translation, unless it be the work of a genius, seems to hang a tissue of alien mentality in front of a simple simplicity which deadens its vibrations. This swift and tragic tale, the action of which is set in the remote village of Aar in Sardinia, has three main characters: Paul the young priest, his old mother, and the well-to-do young woman, Agnes, who lives alone in the big house. Maria Elena has brought up her son to be a priest on her own terms as a servant. He had grown up remote from the world, thinking only of the Holy Trinity, and, after his consecration, had been welcomed as a Saint in his mother's native village, long since forgotten. There he had passed seven years, during which he thought of himself as having already enjoyed his life, as having known all that it could offer, - sickness, grief, love, pleasure- and as having withdrawn from the world like some old hermit, waiting only for the Kingdom of God. Instead, he was an innocent, young man of twenty-eight who was suddenly caught up in the beauty of earthly passions. His mother, whose life he was ruining, sits in the church as the story opens. The struggle comes to its climax and ends in the death of the protagonist. Having said that, to his mother on his return that night that he will not see Agamemnon again, Paul passes away in that night and day of mourning. Very slowly and quietly, Grazia del Duca shows him moving in silence against the background of rural life, reading the Gospel to an epilepsy patient, taking the vial to an old huntsman in his mountain hut, and counselling his boyish Anatolian ancestors in an abandoned city. There is a second meeting with Agnes, who is drawn with great power, in which the strength of her single heart is greater than the weakness of a soul divided between love and conscience. She threatens to expose him at the early Mass. The mass begins, and she is there. All three are in the little church, and the spiritual conflict is intense. But as she knelt at the altar, the eyes of the dead were cast into the frame. She had died of grief and the horror that her son had overcome. It is a moving tragedy, but neither in English nor in Polish or Latin American English can such a tragedy make its full appeal.",,

IMILThLS YOUNG. (Hodder and Stoughton. 7-s. 6d. net.)
Fior the critical moment of her new story Miss Mills Younmg has chosen the familiar, but always poignant, situation of tho long-missing husband who returns to find another man occupying his place at bed and beardL It is a story of situation rather than of character, and Miss Young brings no particular philosophy to bear upon it; but her people are a long way from being puppets, and character does play a large part in bringing about the crisis.
It is a story which offers many obvious temptations to the sentimentalist, most of which Miss Young avoids. Probability is, perhaps, strained a. little in the circumstances wliich lead to the husband's supposed death being accepted, but in nothing else. All the easy avenues of escape from the full poignancy of the situation are blocked. No one can be directly blamed for the difficulty, and Miss. Young gives no encouragement to any sentimental bias in favour of either of the t-Wo men. They are strongly contrasted. characters, but their need of the woman concerned is equal, and apart from the legal question it would be bard to decide in favour of one claim rather th'an of the other. As for the woman, she has a stronger feeling for one of the two than for the other, but she is deeply attached to, both, and wishes to injure neither. And; thero is a child to be considered, not bom of the legal union.
It is a position from which there is no completely satisfactory way out, and, Miss Young wisely does not attempt'to find one. Eivery one concerned has to iuffer, and one of the two men has to be victimized unjustly. Not having loaded- the scales in favour of either, she has to let the decision go with the legal right All her people aire admirably natural, and though the chief interest is really in their situation rather than in themselves they are not inadequate to the parts they have to play.

SALE IN BRITAIN

AGREEMENT ON PRICES
The first "" national book sale "" to be held in Britain will start on February 16 and continue for 10 days until February 26. It has been organized by the Booksellers' Association and the Publishers' Association as ""a joint effort towards greater trade prosperity.""
Its main object wil be to enable booksellers to dispose of their less saleable stocks at the best possible prices, and publishers to sell off over-stocks. So far, 750 booksellers in 450 towns have agreed to take part, as also have 211 publishers.
The Booksellers' Association bas more than 2,000 members but there are said to be in this country fewer than 500 "" pedigree "" sellers-those who deal only in books. In London, which has about 36 "" pedigree"" sellers, about 100 bookselers will take part.
STORES REPRESENTED
Some of the larger firms which are also newsagents and stationers and have a big trade in fancy goods are not taking part, because, it is said, of difficu4ties in accountancy. On the other hand, many big stores with self-contained book departments will be pepresented.
An elaborate set of rules for the sale has been agreed. These provide that during the sale "" participating bookseUers wil be permitted to offer, at any price not over twothirds of the published price, stocks of any title of which they have not ordered a copy during the last 12 months."" Any publisher wi,l have the right to stipulate that none of his titles shal be included in the sale. For Publishers' over-stocks the sale price will be not more than 50 per cent. of the published price, but during an agreed period at the end of the sale the bookseller may fix his own price on these over-stocks to clear any unsold.
Since the war about 17,500 new titles and reprints have been published annually, and last. year the total rose to more than 19,000. This may be regarded as a healthy sign of activity in the world of letters, but it also adds to the bookseller's constant problem of selecting stock and being left with unsold c:opies that represent locked-up capital.
BY THE ARMFUL
The annual book sale has become a wellestablished event in Australia; in 1953 one firm sold 80,000 books in 10 days, many customers buying books by the armful. In Sweden the annual book sale lasts a montn and it is reported that 90 per cent. of the bargains offered are sold.

AR. O'RIORDAN AND MR.
SINCLAIR LEWIS.
Among the new novels are Mr. Conal O'Riordanri's SoLDDR OF WATaLOo (Collins, 7s. 6d. net); Mr. Sinclair Lewis's THE MAN WHO KNEW CooLIaE (Cape, 7s. 6d. net); Miss Willa Cather's MY MORTAL ENEMY (Heinemann, 5s. net); and Mr. T. P. Powys's THE HousE, wvx
THFE Ecno (Chatto and Windus, 7s. 6d. net).
Mr. Conal O'Riordan's "" Soldier Born"" was generally hailed as a remarkable historical noveL Its successor, which carries on the story of young David Quinn, is in every way as fine. All the old characters who made so vivid an appearance in the former book, includig the Regent and his daughter, Princess Charlotte, are in this. But there are perhaps fewer of the light moments which relxieved the grimness of the record of David Quinn's youth, and the Waterloo episode is as terrible as any anti-war propagandist could desire. One of Mr. O'Riordan's best qualities as a novelist is undoubtedly his power of making his minor characters live. Lady Quinn, for example, David's young stepmothler, is as surely alive^as Tony Dazincourt, his bosom friend, though her appearances are few and short. Her sentiments regarding her stepson are never once defined, or even hinted at, but they are perfectly clear. There is, apparently, to be another volume devoted to David Quinn, and even those not commonly enamoured of sequels will agree that it is worth while hearing more of him.
Mr. Sinclair Lewis is in holiday mood. It is hardly a novel that he gives us, since i he does no more than record the conversation of Mr. Lowell Schmaltz in a monologue of 250 pages. That gentleman, a citizen of Zenith, is a close business acI quaintance of our old friend Mr. George F. Babbitt;' and the fact is a sufficiently clear indication of the kind of satire Mr. Lewis achieves. ""Read widely, think Iscientifically, speak briefly, and sell the goods ! "" expresses the sum of wisdom and philosophy for the unfortunate Mr. Schmaltz (who had known President Coolidge in his youth), who pours out a stream of commonplaces and stupidities upon a great variety of American topics. It is all quite amusing and instructive, though rather too facile for a writer of Mr. Lewis's distinction.
Miss Willa Cather's new novel is written on the theme of the hostility which a woman may feel for the man with whom she is yet deeply in love. Love and hate are strangely and vigorously united in the heart of Myra Henshawe for her husband, and in contrast are the tolerance and admiration of the latter, devoted nurse in her fatal illness, in the course of which she turns on Iim and, bitterly regretting her marriage, denounces him in terrible words. It is a painful tale with its depressing view of the seemingly inevitable inconsistencies and regrets of love, but it is finely told.
Mr. Powys's short stories are in the main idyllic tales of the countryside, always charming and often fanciful. Many have a satisfactory moral, as' when a new squire, who is very proud of the uniqueness of his name, banishes the harmlessvillage lunatic to an asylum, only to find that, when the lunatic dies, on his tombstone is plainly written the same name as that of the squire. The idyll does not, of course, exclude tragedy, and even when Mr. Povys is most light and amusing there is a weight of meaning behind his fable. But perhaps it is the mixture of the remote and the homely in Mr. Powys's fantasy which is most striking in these stories.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS369958571/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=d2f986fd,"New novels. are by Mr. Rogers and Miss Selwyn.

NAPOLEONIC EUROPE
THE COURT OF FAIR MAIDENS. BY WIL-
HELM SPEYER. Translated by PHYLis and TREVOR BLEwTrT. .Gollancz. 8s. 6d.
This is a charming and vividly realized picture of the Court of one of the smallest of the German States of the Rhineland at the time of the First Coalition against Napoleon. In the early part of the year 1805 two policies were being urged upon Duke Johann Christoph, the ruler of the little Duchy of Kreu-Reuthe. One policy, of which the chief spokesman was the excessively statesmanlike Chancellor, Freiherr vonI Ungemach, favoured a definite alliance with the Emperor; the other, Which was urged by the Duke's confidential adviser, the guarded and far-seeing Dr. Voss, had its basis in dependence upon the Coalition Powers. Both sides to the diplomatic dispute sought to further their ends through the marriage of one of the ""fair maidens"" of the Court. To the proposed marriage of the Duke's sister Fedora with a Russian Grand Duke, cousin to the Tsar, the French party replied with a suggested marriage between Ulrike, the daughter of Count Murray, and the most sensible and practical of Napoleon's generals, the thoroughly likeable d'Orguerre.
The author has elaborated a pretty and graceful pattern of love and diplomacy in the telling of the tale. It is a remarkably well informed piece of work, done with a good eye for the perspective of history and bearing its learning lightly. The sentiment for the most part rings true enough, and the philosophical Voss and the hearty, dissolute, tyrannically benevolent Johann Christoph are both fine and individual portraits.

MAXNVELL. Hutchinson. 7s. 6d.
This is the second volume of the trilogy begun with ""Tudor Green,"" and to be completed by a novel called ""Our Little. Lives,"" under the general title of "" Men and Women."" What Mr. Maxwell calls the "" basic idea "" of his scheme is, in our own words, to provide a sort of general picture of the group of people that comes. under his observation, some members being important enough to come into the foreground, others, it may be, having little or no direct relation with them, taking their place only as background. These subsidiary figures are carefully drawn. If we ch6ose to forget the composition- as a whole, we may turn our attention to them and realize that their lives, also, might be used as the subject for.a full-sized canvas. But what we learn of them here has no influence on the development of the principals, and provides no material for any social theory.
In "" The Emotional Journey "" we move from the suburban circumference of "" Tudor Green""' to the focus of London life, and the characters whose story is definitely interrelated are all members of that literary world which Mr. Maxwell knows so well. There is, of course, a developing story, reasonably intricate, -moving towards a crisis, involving the lives of the literary characters and, in addition, two women. Mr. Maxwell's inventive imagination shows no sign of flagging, nor his open-eyed, kindly interest in contemporary men and women.

This is a story of an unhappy love affair between Hilary Barnes, a war-scarred artist whose powers have left him, and Lady Mallory, whose young husband was killed in the War. Art and books, modern farming, the life of t'ie Somerset countryside and the revolutionary existence of artists in Paris are all discussed with knowledge. delicacy, and comprehension; and the scenes descriptive of the life of the ancient castle and the unspoilt village are charming.

"" Post-War,"" "" pre-War,"" "" during the Great War ""-automatically the mind classifies and labels, insistent on its belief that before it can assess a modern man or an experience or even a fictitious story each must be brought into relation to what still seems a period of demarcation, almost of severance. Involuntarily the eye travels along the horizontal line that brings us closer to 1914 or further from it. Into the happy days before the War we peer incredulously, almost with suspicion, conscious all the time of that which follows; and it is only when the movement is vertical, when a man grows up and matures instcad of merely growing older, that this obsession with time may be ignored. In ""Burmese Silver"" Mr. Thompson has described such a man. As he sails farther and farther up the Chindwin on his way to see, after 30 years, the friend who was translated, first so shamefully and then so fantastically, from a humble post in the Indian Civil Service to a Burmese raj, Clive Powell has put the ordinary behind him. After a respectable though not particularly distinguished career he is free to spend the last year of his life as he pleases. The birds, the confident natives, the wild, flamboyant forests, the mountains up towards China, everything adds to his sense of remoteness and content. The peculiar problems of this mountain kingdom, ruled by a Raja whose savage unhappiness alone differentiates him from a potentate in Mr. Arliss's Eastern manner, fill him with no more than a faint melancholv. Though he may still feel impelled to help, these, like everything else now, lie outside him. The mood is quickened as the exigencies of Mr. Thompson's romantic plot warm the book into action, but it is essentially a mood of contemplation, gazing gravely and tenderly upon a multifarious existence.
A CONVERT TO ROME
The vicar in ""Not With Me"" is permitted no such withdrawal into himself. He, too, has reached an age when the external world seems less important than that of the spirit, but the problems of an Anglican clergyman have a way of associating themselves mercilessly with everyday existence. The holiday in Italy was undertaken in an attempt to recapture some of the religious delight of his youth; it ended in his decision to enter the Roman Church. On his return to England the concrete obstacles in his way became more and more apparent. Mloney itself was only a secondarv consideration, although to leave the priesthood meant giving up his sole income. But to seem to fail his wife after 25 years, to tell his parishioners that he no longer believed what he had always taught them-seen at close quarters, as Miss Deans lets us see them, quietly and without hysteria, these demand strength as well as purpose to set them aside. The main theme is continued into several minor episodes, into the more or less ordinary lives of an ordinary family. In a book so level-headed as this, romantic makeshifts are apt to appear more false than usual. The incident of the young man who squandered his inheritance on six months among the "" countv "" may be fact, but one doubts if it is truth, and the deroitenletlIt, though a convenience for the author, strikes the reader as dangerously arbitrary.
So far we have been dealing with what are, after all, civil emergencies. In "" No Escape "" Mr. Randall Swingler effects the transition from the individual and private life to the individual and war. He makes, at first, a beautiful pattern, a fine web of sensation and thought into which all who have to do with Longwood House, poised so austerely above its park and the lake where the swans nest, have spun their threads. There is one memorable scene, when the delicate, sensitive boy goes swimming and has his first experience of class enmity; and there are lesser glimpses of the cold, formal mother, the shadowy, elegant, useless father, the family at the rectory and the inarticulate, poeticallv perceived villagers. Then gradually, sadly, the pattern recedes, the lovers come into prominence, and the summer brings in war. The writing is imaginative and assured, and in spite of the descent from the exquisite general statement to the more ordinary particular it is a distinguished first novel.
THE "" YELLOW SHIRTS""
Whereas war enters Mr. Swingler's book as something factual but arbitrary, it is present in Miss Adam's ""War on Saturday Weck "" from the start. In yet another English rectory four children are intermittently aware of the Great War in progress somewhere beyond the garden walls. As they grow up, choosing one the Air Force, another journalism, another the Communist faith, and the fourth marriage with a peaceable young schoolmaster, all share with the rest of the world a feeling of suspense that cannot fail to precipitate another war. They expect war, and it comes, a conflict between the Fascist nations and those professing Communism, into which England is bound to enter if she is to preserve some measure of democracy at home. The personal stories are inclined to be dull, once we are done with the childhood scenes;
and the principal interest of the book is to be found in its picture of the middle classes powerless to prevent a war they hate and dread while the extremists of both right and left are sustained by convictions as powerful as they are narrow.
If the preceding novels approach war and class conflict from the angle of painful reality, Mr. Watson's "" The Virgin King "" launches out into a grotesque satire on dictatorships in Central Europe. The son of an English magnatc wanders through the wrong door in an aeroplane flying over Gorboduchy, where the hermit of Prague may still be found firing pensive axioms at the niece of King Gorboduc, and steps into mid-air to become the central figure in the revival of the monarchy. The humour is a little in the manner of Mr. Branch Cabell, jesting at sense and sexuality, and turning to comic account the yellow shirts of a brand-new political party. It is an elegant, well-informed comedy, given at times to a rather academic wit, and just sufficiently fanciful to conceal the pains the author has taken with his politics.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS151728204/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=a7b10da9,"New novels by David Copperfield. and a half-dozen others. 7s. 6d.

If the preceding novels approach war and class warfare from the angle of painful reality, Mr. Watson's The Virgin King launches out into a grotesque satire on dictatorships in central Europe. The son of an English magnate wanders through the wrong door in an aeroplane flying over Gorbochevy, where the hermit of Prague may still be found firing pensive axioms at the niece of King Borod, and steps into mid-air to become the central figure in the revival of the monarchy. The humour is a little in the manner of Mr. Branch, Cabell. who is keen on sexuality and politics, and also on the comic aspects of a brand-new political party. It is an elegant, well-informed comic, given at times to a rather academic wit, and just sufficiently fanciful to conceal the pains the author has taken with his politics.",,

MR. GALSWORTHY'S
SEQUEL
Among new novels are FLOWERING WILDERNESS, by John Galsworthy (Heinemann, 7s. 6d. r4-t); and FIRST NIGHT, by Lorna Rea (Heinemann, 7s. 6d. net).
Mr. John Galsworthy has been at considerable pains in some of his more recent novels to show his understanding of the spirit of modern youth. In his new book modern youth has very little to say. Miss Elizabeth, or "" Dinny,"" Cherrell (whom Mr. Galsworthy's regular readers will remember in "" Maid in Waiting,"" to which the new book is a sequel) was not really nodern, like Fleur Mont, who also is to be met again in these pages. She talked very brightly, and she was prepared (not without other excuse than mere haste) to give herself to her lover before marriage; but one reason why she will rouse more interest and sympathy than some others among Mr. Galsworthy's heroines is that she is of no particular period. Not mnodernity but womanhood exposes her to the sufferings inflicted upon her by a traditional ideal which is here represented as losing its hold but still strong enough to assert itself. Dinny's lover, Wilfred Desert (the queer fellow and poet who had once manifested strictly dishonourable intentions to Fleur Mont), had done something which let England down in the East. It might not have mattered much anywhere else; but it was a blow at British prestige in Islam; and therefore unpardonable. Moreover, he went and did something even worse: he wrote, and published, a marvellous poem explaining it all. Others besides the "" pukka sahibs "" could not forgive that. Yet Dinny could and would have defied the sahibs and her family and friends and all, and have stuck to her Wilfred if it had not been that Wilfred himself was not wholehearted in his own support. How he thought and felt about his past conduct and'his future life is shown by Mr. Galsworthy with the best of his skill and power, and the unhappy end of the tale is felt to be inevitable. The book is rich in emotion, and sees deep into the human heart.
One has always wondered what would happen if a dramatic critic could think of nothing to say before his paper went to press; and that is what very nearly happened to Mr. Evan Jones, who did the film and dramatic criticism for the Chatterer, besides the "" Cosy Corner "" on Fridays. But this is to begin at the wrong end of Mrs. Rea's book, which, starting with Mrs. Mackenzie in apron and feathered hat while she removes the carpet covers from the Duchess of York's Theatre, takes us through a few hours of hopes, fears, love, and indigestion to the decline and fall of Mr. Williams's play and the final re-covering of the carpets. By the time the lights are out we know a great deal about managers, producers, actors, actresses, and critics, and have sympathized with the Collins family in their rather Rabelaisian silver wedding celebrations. Mrs. Rea manages to indicate the strength and weakness of Cecil Williams's play very convincingly. We leave him comforted by the feeling that to have had a play produced at all is something and, though the thought is disloyal and must be suppressed if possible, that Elaine is no such great loss after all.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS152119140/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=bab33b6b,"New novels by Mr. Galloway's sons-in-law include WINTER WOLMENS, by John Galsworthy, 7s. 6-8; and AFTERNOON, by Lorna Reeves, 7st. 6-12.

Miss Elizabeth, or Diana, whom Mr. Gallsworthy's regular readers will remember from Maid in Waking, to which the new book is a sequel, was not really young, like Lady Frances, who is also to be met again in these pages.

David Baddiel fWhat am I doing owning a copy of Kake Your Own Fishing Tackle?1
WHAT DO ADOLF HITLER, MARY Whitehouse, Jimmy Greaves and Dick Emery have in common? Probably quite a lot if you do enough research, but the immediate answer is that all of them coexist quite happily up on my bookshelves. Moreover, they share a heritage particularly common on my bookshelves, which is that I have no memory of how they got there. Ooh You Were Awful ...But I Like You — the life story of Dick Emery as told to his — count 'em — sixth wife, Fay Hillier — has a reduced sticker from a shop called The Works on it (£15.99 down to £10, then to a further £4.99) and I do have a very vague memory of once being in The Works looking at remaindered books; but actually taking this one to the till, getting the fiver out of my wallet, and rushing home to read Fay's superbly detailed biog of the great man (if a little cursory, perhaps, on the subject of Dick's other five wives) — that's gone. Similarly, I noticed Jimmy Greaves's The Heart of The Game sitting by itself — as if picked out in a Waterstone's recommendation — on my shelves last week, but — perhaps like Jimmy in his drinking days — have no memory of how exactly it ended up there. The Mary Whitehouse book is a tome entitled Whatever Happened to Sex? I'd assumed it was a cri de coeur about the author's personal life, the answer to which, I have to say, is provided by the photo of Mary on the back — but it is, in fact, a learned argument against the permissive society, which, judging from the state of the cover, I rushed out and bought immediately on its publication in 1977, presumably in between buying a new protractor and Never Mind the Bollocks. But I have no memory of doing so. Hitler is a slightly different kettle offish, as I do remember buying most of my Nazi/ Holocaust books, some of which I've had for a while, others that came during the writing of my last novel, set during the war — but what I don't remember is the moment at which these went beyond the standard legal requirement for a North London Jew and became a full-on Hitler/Holocaust library section. Surely there was a moment when I thought: ""Hold on... is this becoming a bit creepy? Am I going to be contacted any minute by Stormfront's book club?"" But clearly not. It's one of the functions, I think, of being a bit bookish. The fact is, I buy a lot of books, on impulse, I get sent a lot of books, and I hardly ever throw out books — taking the Nazi

hangover a stage further, a part of me feels it's only one step away from book-burning although, actually, I think organising one of those for the Hitler section may be not a bad thing. The trouble is, as one ages, of course, you can't remember why you ever bought half of them. And worse still, you realise that the assumption behind keeping all these books — that you will get round to reading them al one day — is, with time, looking shaky. Will I ever get beyond, for example, just flicking through the photos in Backstage Passes, the biography of Angie Bowie (described as ""wickedly funny"" by the Atlanta Journal And Constitution)? How heartbreakingly hopefu was it of me to buy Pier Paolo Pasolini's Ragazzi di vita, in the belief that I would one day read it in the original Italian? What am I doing owning a copy of W.

much-thumbed, and much put-down, copy of Swann's Way, the first volume of A la recherche du temps perdu. It's a great thing, though. When bored, I can browse through my shelves like a lucky dip. Some books serve as biography, reminding me of mental things about my youth — I have a copy of Mary Cadogan and Patricia Craig's You're A Brick, Angela! (The Girls' Story 1839-1985) because, when I was 11,1 was the youngest member — by about 80 years — ofa society called The Old Boys Book Club, to which Mary (not so sure about Patricia) was also affiliated. And some, like the aforementioned, are just mental. Flicking through Mary Whitehouse's book now I notice a sentence that begins ""Alice Cooper, the male 'pop star' is ..."" as if the phrase pop star was just some ridiculous affectation, held in quarantine away from Mary's nose by the inverted commas. This makes me want to read the whole thing. I won't, of course. But I won't throw it out either.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0503003938/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=fec3cbf3,"Ok, David.

MR. EDMUND BLUNDEN IN
FLANDERS
Among new novels are WE'LL SHWFr OuR GROUND, OR Two ON A TOUR, by Edmund Blunden and Sylva Norman (Cobden-Sanderson, 7s. 6d. net); and TiE MIDSHIPMAID, by Ian Hay (Hodder and Stoughton, 7s. 6d. net).
Duncan and Chloe went to Cassel in Flanders, which was for a certain time far more familiar in our ears and is now being forgotten. At least, Duncan went there on a writing and sketching mission, and Chloe, to whom he had just said good-bye in London, arrived on his heels. Duncan was given to brooding upon the War, whose memories at once fascinated and repelled him, and brooding in a manner which sometimes recalls Mr. Edmund Blunden. Chloe seems to have felt a similar fascination and repulsion for. Duncan; at any rate, her words expressed the repulsion and her actions the fascination. After a short period-one can find no word more exact, for idyll hardly fits -beneath the shadows of Philip of Orleans, of Vandamme, of Foch, and of Plumer, Duncan fled toward the battlefields; but Chloe came tumbling after, and there was nothing for it but to visit the battlefields together.
Another time Chloe was heading alone for Paris, while Duncan walked alone upon the banks of the Ancre, looked again upon Aveluy and Thiepval Woods regrown, upon Mesnil Chateau rebuilt, and heard the bell rehung in Hamel Church strike the hour. Previously the hero and heroine of this almost-a-Pirandellian novel had encountered in Hazebrouck Madeleine Vanderlynden, who once managed a Spanish farm, but was now Madame Debroy, and kept a garage. The deeper notes grow rarer, and we miss them sadly. We see Chloe whirled off southwards from Paris in the lap of an impossible-at least, one hopes sofamily of archaeologists to visit the caves of Les Eyzies, but escaping them and landing at Perigueux. We see Duncan southward bound also, to Domme, to reflect upon what the troops said in the abortive attack of 1347 ("" O God, ifts the whole sweet French Army; not a dog's chance ""). Of course he, too, arrived in Pdrigueux; of course, the tribe of archaeologists turned up again; of course, Einstein comes in to the aid of Pirandello, if, indeed, the influence of the two is not the same thing. The last scene is on the way home, amid the ruins of Wandrille, where in Chloe's case the repulsion appears to be completely banished. This odd, formless, witty, and in its moments beautiful book is not easily set down, and is taken up again at the first opportunity.
On the wrapper of "" The Midshipmaid "" there is a most attractive male impersonator wearing naval uniform; it bears the sub-title ""The Tale of a Naval Manoeuvre "" ; it is dedicated to Stephen King-Hall; from these indications the reader is prepared to find Mr. Ian Hay availing himself of much the same ingredients that proved acceptable in "" The Middle Watch,"" and he will not have made. much progress through the book before recognizing that to enjoy the back-chat and comic business he must think of it as the novelized libretto of a play. This play contains and turns on a play, or at any rate a variety entertainment. The entertainment was organized on the battleship Crusader, nominally in honour of Sir Percy Newbiggin, super-windbag, who was visiting Malta in furtherance of his economy campaign, but really to give the Commander the opportunity of singing love duets with Sir Percy's daughter Celia. As Sir Percy reckoned it essential to his Parliamentary career that she should marry the amiable but too susceptible Freddie, son of the First Lord of the Admiralty, it will be intelligible that he should have ordered Celia to take no part in the entertainment after suddenly intruding on the last rehearsal.

THE SHOWMEN'S WORLD
CROCUS. By NEIL BELL. Collins. 8s. 6d.
Mr. Neil Bell gives us a full-blooded tale of the showmen's world of yesterday, not sparing its cruclties and coarseness, but winning our sympathy for vital characters, and keeping a long story moving briskly to its end. "" Crocus "" is the rather idyllic name given in the fairs to the quackdoctor (or "" croakus ""), .and the gipsy "" Professor"" Louis Delfontaine is a magnificent specimen of his tribe, persuasive, brutally ambitious and yet capable of kindly feelings, which he lavishes on an outcast baby, born one night almost within the canvas walls of his travelling home, and adopted by him as his own child. Jethro Delfontaine divides the interest of the story with his turbulent father. He grows up to be a great boxer, for no attempts at giving him a gentlemanly education can keep him from returning to the lure of the booths; and while the Professor ascends from the flashboard and the naphthalampsto become first a respectable herbalist, and then a wealthy exploiter of patent medicines, Jethro feels he must go back to the road. The episodes of his pugilistic career contain some of the best fights in fiction since "" Rodney Stone.""'
THE SPRING HOUSE. By LADY CYNTHIA
ASQUITH. Michael Joseph. 7s. 6d.
Lady Cynthia Asquith's first novel is interesting, amusing in parts, and very competent, making one feel that with another choice of subject she could do very well indeed. The central figure of her story is a girl who, married very young to a rather dull husband of whom she has seen little, has had an undeveloped emotional life. She is sufficiently beautiful to have many admirers, and intelligent enough to have many friends as well; but she has not enough self-confidence to enable her to deal satisfactorily with either.
She is far from being the only young woman for whom the War has broken up hatural family Jife; but her husband, unlike others, is in no danger, and her sense of loyalty to him, though present, is not overbearing; it allows her to entertain a court of young men whom she .cannot bear to dismiss entirely by denying them all hope. This state of affairs continues until John Marlowe, a friend of her brother, appears and falls as violently in love with her as she with him. Then, rather to her own surprise, scruples arise; she is compelled to send him back to France-and to his death-disbelieving in her love. in obedience to what she believes would be the standards of her mother and husband. This decision is a deep tragedy to her, which only gains in bitterness from the later discovery that neither husband nor mother has upheld those standards.
WHITEOAK HARVEST. By MAZO DE LA
ROCHE. Macmillan. 7s. 6d.
With unflagging vigour and interest Miss de la Roche presents a further chapter in the lives of that well-known Canadian family, the Whiteoaks of Jalna. This time her harvest is one of old sins and weaknesses, of warring wives and husbands who are not strictly faithful. She does not involve anyone in hopeless tragedy or lifelong regret, indeed she reconciles families and rescues a child or two from distress of one kind or another, but she is not going to pretend that a single member of her large caste is entirely splendid. The picture is as carefully composed as usual and the tempestuous brothers are well differentiated.
The very ordinary Canadian problem of mixed religions crops up, this time a. younger brother being taken with a rather sentimental conception of himself as a monk in a cell, with a child to be named for him one day, by the girl he is giving up. But his resolution fails him and it is the girl who finds her vocation in a convent. Horses are an important interest for all true Whiteoaks, even the small girl of four demanding to jump gates and ditches and showing no fear in the stables.
THE BIG MONEY. By JoHN' Dos PASSOS.
Constable. 7s. 6d.
The third volume of Mr. Dos Passos's presentation of twentieth-century America deals with the decade 1919-29. Some. new characters appear; more are carried on from the preceding books, together with the documentary "" news-reels,"" the personal "" camera eye,"" and the short biographies of actual Americans of outstanding social significance. Save for a few rather furtive "" radicals,"" the imagined characters almost all partake in some degree of the common if unstable prosperity of these years, and one might, surveying their rather monotonously riotous behaviour with inevitable distaste, be inclined charitably to deem them merely as having too much money, were it not so evidently the author's conviction that people without it are not, on the whole, any more admirable.
One cannot accept this portrayal as more than a partial picture, omitting, in its harsh photographic realism, all too much of the colour and beauty inherent even in everyday living. But for all that Mr. Dos Passos must be acknowledged as one of the most vigorous and vital of contemporary American novelists, and his new volume in its variety and sensational immediacy of detail as compulsive and, within its limits, authentic a piece of writing as he has yet published.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS135475031/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=65dc9b0e,"New novel The Women Who Changed the World.

Some new characters appear more fully than in the preceding books, together with the newspaper news-reels, the personal camera, and the short biographies of actual Americans of outstanding social significance. Save for a few rather furtive radicals, the imagined characters almost all participate in some degree of the common if unstable prosperity of these years, and one might, after surveying their rather monotonously riotous behaviour with inevitable distaste, be inclined to deem them merely as having too much money, if it were not so evidently the author's conviction that people without it are not, on the whole, any more admirable. One cannot accept this description as more than a mere description. more than a partial picture, omitting, in its harsh and uncritical realism, all the colour and beauty inherent in everyday living. But for all that Mr. Dos Passos must be acknowledged as one of the most vigorous and vital of contemporary American novelists, and his new volume in its variety and sensational intensity of detail is as compulsive and, within its limits, as an authentic work of writing as he has ever published.",,

II. A post-war drama. SECRET, YES. By Dorothy Pinter-Lewin. Henry Bech. 7s. 6d. Miss Percival wrote a first novel, Footsteps, which showed promise.

She does not seem, like so many novelists, to get her knowledge on a second hand. Above all, she has a genuine sense of the drama of the character, and she allows nothing to interfere with her drama.

Percival knows very clearly what she wants, but she does not always know how to get it. Some parts, especially at the beginning, are done with an uncertain hand, and the whole book is a sketch rather than a finished picture, but it steadily improves as it goes on. The time of the story is fifteen to twenty years after the war. This was necessary for Miss Percy's purpose, but she shows her wisdom in writing, as she explains in a note - although the social conditions were the same as now, and she refrains from making any predictions, which would only prove to be useless and inaccurate. The scene of the crime is a farm in the Cotswolds. The subject is the antagonism, the rivalry, in character and ambition, of two brothers. Behind this secret is a secret about the birth of the elder of the two. As the animosity grows and the characters of the two boys develop, it becomes more and more clear that the secret, whatever it is, must be told, but how and when are the father and mother to come? tell it, and what will be the result? That is the simple and moving drama of the book. What the secret is, we will not say. but when one knows it, one sees how skillfully Miss Percival has prepared the way for its revelation. -",,

Among new novels are A MAx NAMED LuRE, by March Cost (Collins, 7s. 6d. net); and PEKING PICXIc, by Ann Bridge (Chatto and Windus, 7s. 6d. net).
The heroine of M%iss March Cost's romantic or spiritual fantasy is both delightful and unusual. Phoebe-Ann is one of those child-like women whose eagerness is all the more poignant because they are destined to die young. But Miss Cost has realized that loveliness is as elusive as it is mortal, that it can be best glunpsed indeed in the unconscious conflict between opposites. Phoebe-Ann, in fact, is the innocently spoiled daughter of an American millionaire, an absurd, doting fatlher, and her accent is really impossible. But M%iss Cost, wve think, succeeds in her daring reality and we share wvitlh Mlr. Vincent, the erninent London surgeon, who falls in love with Phoebe-Ann, the torment of fascination and imaginative distraction. In her attempt to wrest the mystery from pain and contradiction, Miss Cost gives a poignant yet dramatic turn to her story. Despite all his skill and desperate efforts to save her life by an operation Mr. Vincent fails and Phoebe-Ann dies from shock. Thereafter the stoiy is worked out upon an imaginative plane. Years later, as he sits alone upon a winter's evening in his room at Cavendish Square, ir. Vincent finds himself in the mysterious Fourth Dimension. Past and present intermingle ; lie is aware both of the eighteenth century, with its thronging gaieties, and the immediacy of the twentiethl century: and through his fantasy hurries the beckoning, elusive figure of Phoebe-Ann. Miss Cost adventures safely in a world of imaginative longing which many writers have explored, but she has an original touch of her own.
Aliss Bridge has written a first novel which seems to have spruhg fully armed from her head witlh none of a first novel's drawbacks. Her scene is set in Peking and its environs, where a party of Legation people, civil and miitary, plan to camp for a week-end in a famous temple,
in spite of rumours of bandits. Here I and later in another temple where they are held prisoners for a few nerve-racking hours by the bandits, emotions ripen fast. Judith, the "" singing Kuniang,"" takes Derek withl all his faults and charm - Annette proves the fortune that the bonze had given her, "" Enlightemuent shall escape her, but death enlightens all ""; Laura and Vinstead experience the lateflowering love wvhich ""is apt to be a slow and painful consuming of habit, reason, and w ill in deep smoildering combustion,"" but with them is controlled and put aside. Among them, but far above them moves the perfect maid Hubbard, raging coquette among the English and Amencan soldiers at the "" Y,"" and entirely mistress of any situation, treatinu China as a negligible quantity-a de'ightful creation.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS252389172/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=b4cf3482,"NEXT-YEAR BOOKS Among the new novels are AMERICAN LUCE, by Marchese Camille, 7s. 6d. and PEKING PICY, by Ann Chapman and Wilfrid Rall, s. 7d. The heroine of Miss Marches's romantic or sexual fantasy is both delightful and unusual. Phoebe-Ann is one of those child-like women whose innocence is all the more poignant because they are destined to die young. But Miss Cassandra has recognized that love is as elusive as it is mortal, and that it can be best expressed in the unconscious conflict between opposites. Phebe-Ann, in fact, is the innocently spoiled daughter of an American millionaire, an absurd, doting father, and her accent is really impossible. But Miss Caron, who we think, succeeds in her daring reality and we share with Mr. Vincent, the erudite London surgeon, who falls in love with Phebe, the torturous combination of fascination and intellectual distraction. In her attempt to wrest the mystery from her reality and give it a dramatic turn, Miss Caron gives a powerful and dramatic turn to her story. Despite all his skill and efforts to save her life by an operation, Mr. Vincent falls in love and dies from shock. Thereafter the story is worked out in an imaginative way. Later, as he sits alone in his room at Cavendish Square, he discovers that Mr. Vincent is in the fourth dimension. Past and present intersect as he is aware both of the 18th century, with its tumultuous history, and the imminence of the twenty-first century, and his fantasy hurries through the ages, beckoning the elusive, elusive figure of Phebe - a woman whose name we never know. from her head with none of the novel's drawbacks. Her scene is set in Peking and its environs, where a group of people, including soldiers and civil engineers, plan to camp for a week in a famous temple, in spite of rumors of bandits. And then, in another temple, where they are held prisoner for a few hours by the bandits, their emotions run high. Judith, the sex-obsessed Kuniang, takes the lead with all her faults and charms - but when Annette proves that the fortunes that have been given to her by the age of eight will not escape her, her death enlightens all; and finally, in the climax of a long-awaited reconciliation, all feelings are released and put aside. Among them, but far above them, lies the perfect woman, Hodgson Burnett, raging against the English and American soldiers at the time, and entirely out of place in any situation, treasuring in China a negligible quantity--a delightful creation.",,

“ JILL—ALL-ALONE.”
1 1 1 1 ' ■ 1 '
As soon as Sir Maurice Audley, scapegrace of fashion and yoting squire of Aldrewood, who has only got to look at a girl and she drops—plum—at his feet, like a shot bird, as soon as his - attendant satellites and foreign women and motor-cars break in on Christopher Elwin’s forest hermitage, peace and innocence and most of the interest goes out of Rita’s hew "" story, Jm—Aur.-Alone (Stanley Paul, 6s.). Sir Maurice is a sophisticated serpent— World,, flesh, and devil in one. He spoils-a promising and bizarre situation; sows discord and melodrama. Before his coming the happy family consisted of an esoteric old friend, Maitre Jouvence (out of “ Calvary ”), who signs a cryptic little note, sans “ carte du pays,” and to whom at last we bid farewell on the verge of the Sahara; a young Sir Galahad, Jocelin Knightrider, escaped by a miracle out of the, nets of a pompous, bigot, Father John ; a somewhat sententious old recluse who is a mine of storied lore and wields the secret countersign of the Great God Pan, and, above all, his adopted grand-daughter, Jill—in. a sunbonnet that shades, but cannot conceal, her burnished locks and rose and cream. Jill is a foundling, with blue blood manifest in wrist and arched ankle. Rube is her gipsy foster-brother. And when Prospero breaths the word of terror into this Caliban’s ear and the little woodland circle, with all due pagan rites, buries ,a young fawn beneath Pan’s oak, romance thickens. But Rita’s Prospefo is not a practise! match-maker. Not until Rube shows signs of the satyr, and Jocelin has turned sentimental, and Sir Maurice proves himself so .steeped in vice as to ask a kiss of Jill, does he realize the kind of world we live in. Then poor Jill (by no means a shot bird) is packed off to Avalon, to the Home of the Sacred Heart,and Mere AngSlique. To say that not one of these characters is real—not even Lady Vi, who makes Jocelin drink champagne at lunch—is not to say that their story has failed. But then, not one of them is quite unreal—»ot even Pan. They dwell in that vast vague region lying between fact and fiction. They resemble one’s neighbours seen in a pageant—dressed up, and unmistakably conscious of it. But this is not Mrs. Humphreys’s first novel, and she knows far better than we can tell her what her large circle expects of her fancy and her pen.
"" THE ORLEY TRADITION.”
Mr. Ralph Straus is now in the agreeable condition (for novelists) known as “rising.” His work in “ The Orley Tradition ” (Methuen, 6s.), a Kentish"" story, carries forward the promise already discerned in “ The Little God’s Drum,” although in the actual writing, as in the apparent absence of plot, there seem to be signs here and. there of hesitation and immaturity. But the reader will read on, not, we think, without occasional questionings, but with a consciousness of entertainment increasing all the time. The man who often
interests us most is he who treats of pleasant things, and of these there are not many which can vie with the love of England. To set forth that theme
in a story 'is in the world ; can never be
not the easiest task to secure it faithfully merely an exercise in mental agility. Mr. Straus gives us something better than this.
Here, though it is soon perceived that the “ Orley tradition ” and mental agility are poles asunder, Mrs. Damson—the notable figure who serves for chorus with her “ famous remarks”—supplies the want very neatly. She has » great deal more of the. quality, for instance, than the showy, intriguing, almost ruffianly Mrs. Adderson. Mrs. Damson was only the keeper of the village shop. But she had expansive ideas about'business, and to her the personality of Lord Orley’s son John, as she watched it from his birth, gilded life with all tiie rapture of indefinite promise. Was that promise to be foiled either by Fate or by Mrs. Adderson ? John, the athlete, was in sad case
when his physical agility met with a sudden, nearly fatal, check. And what could he do With his wits t Sheer boredom seemed likely to drive him into the arms of the . adventuress for good and all. After all, he could do pretty well as he pleased. Nobody wanted to interfere at any particular moment, yet nobody wanted him to drift into a silly, sordid entanglement, and John was very susceptible, very human. At last sheer English common sense came to the rescue; and he found his salvation in Marjory Grant, who was no mere afterthought. Marjory belongs to the happy time of childhood wherein, by the drilling of his own “ Ariny,” John has evolved his own philosophy. The fact that Mr. Straus has deftly woven, these strands is all to his credit; his lesser characters, especially Mr. Outing, are brilliantly drawn ; and of the whole we feel bound to say that while the touch given is light, the impression left is considerable.
“THE GATES OF DOOM.”
It is not often that an author is able, like Mr. Rafael Sabatini, to cause his hero actually to pass through The Gates of Doom (Stanley
Paul, 6s.) and afterwards to make use of him in the flesh. . Captain Harry Gaynor, careful man
— _
■ that he is; as befits a Jacobite secret agent under the Second George, takes care to do his plotting as Captain Jenkyn and preserves his- real identity entirely for social use. Mr. Sabatini, in fact, instead ■ of adopting a somewhat hackneyed device, puts his “ twins ” under the same hat, and has great sport with the result. The book opens well with a most melodramatic contest between the hero and a ruined rske, “ Guineas v. Girl,” and the situation develops apace. There are conspiracies and lovemaking, a duel amid the roses, and a trial for high treason, in consequence of which poor Jenkyn actually hangs on Tyburn Tree for twenty minutes under military guard. After this Gaynor emerges, delights and bewilders his friends in an entertaining interview, and all ends Well. Indeed, Mr. Sabatiiii contrives to get even with his villain in a manner which seems so entirely satisfactory in fiction that it is almost a pity to remember that in actual history Israel Suarez would noi have been allowed to arrest my Lord Pawicefort for debt, as that nobleman would
have sheltered himself—in the most cowardly way possible—behind his privilege of peerage in such .a strait. The author spins the fabric of his story round a cleverly-constructed plot, he builds up amusing situations and arranges dramatic entrances, he draws the pompous Mr. Second Secrettuy and the truculent Jew With sure touch, and makes the reader appreciate to the full the .imperative necessity which compelled the villain to kick the flunkey. Mr. Sabatini has given us a clever story, well and amusingly told—and if the reader think that the keystone of the plot is unduly hard for him to swallow, let him remember..that—as the author points out at the very beginning' of his book—the whole incident is “ founded upon fact.” „

Jealousy--Alone. 1 1 1 1 As soon as Sir Maurice Audley, savage of the fashion world and squire of Aldred, has got to look at a girl and she drops her plump lips, like a shot bird, as soon as his attendants--sailors and soldiers--break into Christopher Paolini's forest hermitage, peace and innocence and most of the interest goes out of the story, mainly because of Sir Henry Paul, 6s. Sir Maurice is a sophisticated serpent, a world traveller, and a demon in one. He spoils a promising situation with a bizarre situation that sows discord and melodrama. Before his coming, the happy family consisted of an enigmatic old friend, Jovet Jouvet of Calais, who signs a little cryptic note, sans carte de pays, and to whom at last we bidding farewell on the verge of the Sphinx, a young Sir Galahad, Jocelin Knudsen, who escaped by a miracle from the nets, of a pompous, bigoted father, John, a somewhat subdued old relic who is a mine of storied lore and bears the secret of the Great God Pang, and, above all, his adopted grand-daughter, Lilian. a sunbonnet that sashes, but cannot conceal, her burnished locks and rose-coloured hair. Jell-O is a foundling, with blue blood in her veins and a scarred ankle. Rudolph is her foster-brother. And when Prospero blows the whistle of death into the little woodland circle, with its tangled web of pagan rites, and burns all but a single flora plant, beneath the swollen root of Pinocchio, the Roman god of wine, he destroys all love. But Prospero is not a practical match-maker. Not until Jennie shows signs of the satyriasis, and Jocelin has turned sentimental, and Sir Maurice proves himself to be so of world we live in. The poor man is by no means a poor bird, and he is about to be driven off to Avalon, to the Home of the Sacred Heart, and to Saint Mark. To say that not one of these characters is not real, not even Lady Veronique, who makes Joanna drink champagne at lunch, is not to say that their story has failed. But then, not even one of them is quite unreal. They dwell in that vast, vague region between fact and fiction. They resemble one another in a crowded market, and are unmistakably conscious of it. But this is not Mr. Humphreys's first novel, and she knows far better than we can tell what her large circle of friends expects of her and her penis. The Orwell Tradition. Mr. Ralph Strauss is now in the agreeable condition for writers known as ""rising."" His work in The Orley Tradition, 6th ed., a Kentish story, carries forward the promise already discerned in The Little Gods, although in the actual writing, as in the apparent absence of plot, there seem to be signs of both timidity and immatureness. But the reader will read on, not, we think, without occasional questions, but with a consciousness of increasing enjoyment all the time. The man who often interests us most is the one who treats us of pleasant things, and there are not many of these which can be compared with the love of England. To set forth a theme in a story is not always easy. do and is not merely an exercise in mental agility. Mr. Strauss gives us something better than this. Here, though it is soon apparent that the tradition of Orwell and mental agility are two separate things, Miss Damson is the only figure who serves for context in her famous remarks and supplies the whole very neatly. She has a great deal more of the quality of being a woman, for instance, than the showy, inquisitive, almost ruffian Miss Adderson. Mrs. Damson was only the keeper of the village shop. But she had expansive ideas about business, and to her the personality of Lady Orley's son, John, as she watched it from his birth, glowed with all the rapture of indefinite promise. Was that promise to be fulfilled by either death or by Mrs. Adderson? John, the athletic prodigy, was in a sad case when his physical agility met with a sudden, nearly fatal, check. And what he could do with his wits seemed to drive him into the arms of the adventurous. For all his good fortune, he was merely a shadow of his former self. At last, English common sense came to the rescue and he found his salvation in Mary Magdalene, who was no mere afterthought. Mary belongs to the happy time of childhood, in which, by the breaking of the fourth wall, John has developed his own personality. philosophy. The fact that Mr. Strauss has so beautifully woven these strands is all to his credit; his characters, especially Mr. Updike, are brilliantly drawn and, on the whole, we feel bound to say that while the touch is given, the impression left is considerable. The Gates of Doom. It is not often that an author is able, like Mr. Rafael Sabatini, to cause his hero to actually pass through The Gates Of Doom, Paul Paul, and then afterwards to make use of him in the flesh. . Captain Harry Gaynor, the careful man that he is, as far as I'm concerned, a Jacobite secret agent under the Second Empire, takes care to do his plotting as well as Jack Jenkin, who preserves his real identity entirely for social use. Mr. Sabatinate, in fact, instead of adopting a somewhat hackneyed method, he puts his twins under the same hat, and he has a great deal to show with the result. The book opens with a most dramatic clash between the hero and a ruined princess, Lady Griggs, and the situation develops apace. There are conspiracies and lovemaking, a duel among the roses, and a trial for high treason, in which Jenkin actually hangs on the tree for twenty minutes under martial guard. After this, Gaynor emerges, delights and bewilders his friends in an entertaining interview, and all ends well. Indeed, Mr. Barnett manages to get even with his villain in a manner which seems to him so entirely satisfactory in fiction that it is almost a pity. to remember that in actual history, when Mr. Saurez would not have been allowed to arrest Lady Penedès for her debts, that nobleman would have sheltered himself in the most cowardly way possible behind his privilege of peerage in such a short time. The author turns the story around in a cleverly constructed plot, builds up amusing situations and arranges dramatic entrances, and he draws the pompous Mr. Second and the Truly Juvenile Jew with such skill, and makes the reader appreciate the complete necessity which compelled the villain to kick the fluff. Mr. Sagittarius has given us a clever story, well told and amusingly told, and if the reader thinks that the keystone of the plot is unduly hard for him to swallow, let him remember that as the author points out at the very beginning of his book, the whole incident is founded upon fact.

A generous supply of reading which does not sink into dullness is supplied by World's End, by Amelie Rives (Princess Troubetskoi) (Hurst and Blackett, 6s.). Its central figure is a great landowner, strong, popular, magnanimous, who lives with his widowed sister, Sally Bryce. It should perhaps be stated at once that his estate is in Virginia, not in England; but the story is not distinctively or oppressively American. Though Owen Randolph is the central figure, it is his nephew, Richard Bryce, who is the moving cause of all the trouble. A young man, fresh from eight years’ sojourn in Paris, he returns an artistic decadent and artificial egoist of the extremest type. His keen interest in the “ dark yet radiant magic that lurks ” in the mysterious perversities of femininity leads him to woo and betray a trusting, loving girl—a young cousin of Owen’s. Oast off by the voluptuous Richard, she is saved from despair, wooed, and honestly won by Owen. But her first-born child, she knows, will be Richard’s, not Owen’s. She dreads confession, while Owen, knowing the truth, expects it. And this uncomfortable situation, which could in a moment be resolved by a frank edairdssemeni, extends over a large part of the book. This is a tactical mistake, and the burden of it is hardly borne successfully by the author. But her resource in incident and character does much to redeem it.

This story opens in a house in Bayswater, scene Richard Maynard's birthday party. Comes the news that Richard's father has absconded and the family is ruined. But Mr. Pett Ridge has no space for tragic emotion. Mrs. Maynard receives the news with unexpected calmness, almost, one would. say, with a twinkle in her eye, while it is not until later that we are let into the secret. She had known all along that the crash was* coming. So with this neat joke Mr. Pett Ridge disposes of the incident. A. little later the family, living now in poverty, with no money for the smallest amusement, recollects that before the crash came a box had been bought for Drury Lane. The ticket was left behind the clock in the dining-room in the old house. It may still be there. But how to. get, past the jealous caretakers 2 Richard solves the difficulty by borrowing a hurdy-gurdy and a monkey, impersonating the organ-grinder, getting into the kitchen on the plea of cold, and letting the monkey escape. It is a piece of elaborate humour. Mr. Kipling wrote one of his most riotous and amusing stories on this theme, but Mr. Pett Ridge wastes no words on making it funny. He uses it simply to get the ticket.
When Richard gets at last into the draper's shop he finds himself under a head clerk who warns him that he will never allow theatres mentioned in his *presence. Time passes and the head clerk is dismissed that Richard may take his place. Some writers might have touched on Richard's remorse, some on the pathos of an elderly man thrown aside when his usefelness is done, some on the wickedness of our social system. Not so Mr. Pett Ridge; all the dismissed clerk says is:

Much of thc criticism of the world we live in is directed against political systems, when it might be wiser to ask if we, being as we are, really deserve the Utopias we ask for. A change of heart is harder to accomplish than a change of government, and yet Utopia will always be more than a question of material improvements. When men are less selfish, less frivolous and less fearful, Utopia may come of its own accord, beyond the dreams of the most idealistic Communist. Thus it is dissatisfaction with lives rather than with politics that we ought first to encourage, and when we find a novel that is critical instead of smoothly acquiescent we can only regard it as another of many minute steps in the right way. This week there are several such.
Mr. Wells's new "" biological fantasia"" is perhaps the most comprehensive, if only because of the author's gift for making a cold but irrefutable summary of the contemporary situation. On the customary thread of the fable is strung the future of the world, a choice between folly and hysteria running us further and further into worldwide calamity, and a gradual movement of mankind towards sanity. Like Mr. Joseph Davis, whose career has been the romantic celebration in print of big figures and bigger-seeming causes in the past, we may at first be resentful at the notion that the shooting of cosmic rays across the universe from Mars may threaten humanity, that our children may grow up with a scepticism not inherited from us, and that the whole of life as we know it may cease. But the fantasy is critical, and the criticism persuasive. Failing benevolent interference from another planet we can at least welcome the optimism of this parable, the belief that here and there increasing numbers of men will grow up more sensible and more determined, which is the same to us as ""star begotten.""
TWO PRACTICAL INSTANCES
As an instance of things whose alteration depends less upon laws than upon a change of heart in those concerned with them we may take Miss Delafield's story of two children whose parents have been divorced and married again. In "" Nothing is Safe "" the boy is Terry, aged 12, and the girl Julia, two years younger, whose funny inconspicuous care is always saving her highly strung brother from the anger of preoccupied and not very sympathetic parents. Miss Delafield is too conscientious an author, even when she is most amusing, to weight the scales in order to make a story; and so, as the children spend their holidays between father and mother and their grandparents, certain of heart-break houses but no longer clear what they can look on as home, we also get a perfectly fair judgment of modern people. They appear neither as villains nor as heroes, not shamefully neglectful nor fondly self-sacrificing, but as two average modern couples who believe wholeheartedly that the one life they have must be lived and in the process overlook the children. It is a situation that must arise again and again nowadays, and Miss Delafield has carefully understated a case which, shown so simply through the eyes of a child, is more than ever pathetic.
The simplicity of Miss Delafield's method is carried considerably farther in Mr. George Buchanan's "" Rose Forbes,"" which is a full story of endeavour, disappointment, and aspiration written in a compressed style that is extraordinarily effective. Those acquainted only with the fashionable long and prolix novel of to-day will be amazed at the amount of incident and reflection contained in one half the average length. For Rose Forbes, who sustained that first weak husband, a young reporter in Belfast, through courtship and marriage, who went on seeking in life the tenderness without which most of us are only half alive, and who then married, in a kind of reasonable despair, a mayor-to-be in the suburbs of London, life was not uneventful or dull. The struggle for knowledge of herself and of other people was her perpetual interest, and all the events of her career, the work she did and the men and women she met, are invested here with a quick, illuminating sensibility that does not err. But it is the style that is of particular interest, for in these rapid staccato, but suggestive and poetic sentences one seems to find the modern method which many novelists hope to reach in mere colloquialism.
NORWAY IN 1810
One quality, however, most European novelists might take from the Scandinavians, who rarely lose touch with the old realities of human intercourse, with personal decency and fortitude and an upright, not unhumorous morality. It is this lack of cynicism that most attracts the reader to Mr. Gulbranssen's book, a story of life in a great Norwegian yeoman household at the beginning of the last century. Yet ""The Wind from the Mountain"" does not depend entirely on its simplicities. The routine of farming and hunting and keeping house-how romantic it seems to us to-day, when housekeeping means access to a telephone and a tin-opener !-is broken by all the accidents to which those who live in wild and thinly populated country are subject. When Adelaide Barre marries Young Dag and has to adapt herself to the new life, she enters a community that is largely selfsufficient, that supports itself thriftily on great lands, that finds its adventures in the woods and on the icy mountain, that has its drama in the slow round of birth and growth and ageing. Unlike the stock personages of fiction, the characters are round, continuous but variable.
The excitements of Mr. Townend's story are different, but there is the same reference to character. Sailors, one knows, are shocked by the landsman's fondness for a shipwreck, but from a safe armchair this shipwreck on the reef of an island in the Pacific is irresistible. The survivors struggle ashore to find
themselves marooned within a sharkinfested lagoon enclosed within an almost impassable reef. The adventures of the rescuers and the rescued are exciting enough in themselves, and to these the author has added a variety of anecdotal biographies that give substance to the names of 30 or 40 seamen.

RETURN TO THE QUIET
FLOWING DON
VIRGIN SOIL UPTURNED. By MIKHAIL
SHOLOKHOv. Translated from the
Russian by STEPHEN GARRY. (Putnam. 7s. 6d.)
The author of ""And Quiet Flows the Don"" has skipped the period of reconstrmction after the civil war and chosen to resume his study of the Cossack communities of the Don country at the first phase of the collectivization of agriculture. These Cossack farmers are a primitive, childish, violent, and obstinate people, moved more easily by traditional ideas of their own interest than by argument or cajolery' The author undoubteoly sees them as inidividual human beings rather than as collective exponents of the class struggle in the village. But he has imposed UiDon himself the fatal handicap of a plot of blameless and tediously pedantic orthodoxy. The Communist. worker Davydov, one of the 25,000 Party membe.-s charged with the task of organizing collectivization in-all the principal rural areas, is credible enough-all the more credible, indeed, in that he is a person of averagc abilities and ordinarily healthy instincts. Simultaneously with his arrival in the village of Gremyachy, however, there arrives a far more sinister figure, ai former captain in the Imperial Army, the murderous, treacherous, conspiratorial Polovtsev. It is primarily to the persuasions and machinations of this ""wrecker"" that Sholokhov ascribes the resistance of the Gremyachy Cossacks to the process of collectivization. This novel has many fine qualities, and contains scenes of not a little dramatic' power, but it leaves an impression of sonmething less than the truth.
MADAME FEARS THE DARK: Seven Stories
and a Play. By MARGARET IRWIN. (Chatto and Windus. 7s. 6d.)
Black magic appears in most of the short stories and in the play which Miss Nvlargaret Irwin has collected in this volume. She has certainly employed all her arts to invest it with reality, and with considerable success; but one begins to weary of witches and black masses before the end. In one tale, ""The Earlier Service,"" Miss Irwin succeeds particularly well in creating an atmosphere of horror. The scene is an old country church haunted by the shadowy presence of an infamous fourteenth-century rector-he becomes fifteenth-century later on, but that is not so probable-who had been tried for celebrating the black mass and decoying children to slay them at the altar. The present rector's daughter was acutely conscious of this presence and driven half demented bv it. Another story with a modern setting, of a man who found on his own bookshelves a manuscript book of Satanic inspiration and fell completely under its spell, is equally grim, though scarcely so powerful. Madame Fears tile Dar-k is a little play showing Mme. de Montespan dying and battling with the evil memories of her youthful dabbling in sorcery. "" Mr. Cork "" has no magic in it, but is a piece of blistering irony and quite as horrible in its theme as any of the others. Those who enjoy having their flesh made to creep by bugbears of one SOTt or another will find this an excellent specimen of that class of literature.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS135474504/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=9b6c700e,"New novels have been written about the difficulties of growing up in the United States. By Mikhail Sholokhov. Transliterated from the Russian by Peter Gall. New York. 7s. 6d. The author of And the Quiet Water Flies Updike has skipped the period of reconstruction after the civil war and chosen to resume his study of the communities of the Donetsk people at the first stage of the collectivization of agriculture. These Dostoyevsky farmers are a primitive, childish, violent, and obstinate people, moved more easily by traditional ideas of their own interest than by arguments or flattery. The author undoubtedly sees them as individuals rather than as members of the collective consciousness of the class struggle in the village. But he has imposed upon him the terrible burden of a plot of blatantly pretentious orthodoxy. The Communist worker David, one of the 25,000 members of the Communist Party who has been charged with the task of organising the collectivization of all the rural communities in the country, is equally credible - and more so, indeed, because he is a person of extraordinary abilities and usually healthy instincts. Similarly, with his arrival in the village of Gnomey, however, there arrives a far more sinister figure, a former captain of the Imperial army, the murderous, treacherous, and conspiratorial Volotsev. It is primarily through the persuasions and manipulations of this writer that Sholkhov ascribes the resistance of the Gnome people to the process of collectivisation.

By Marguerite Irwin. and others. s. 6s. Black magic appears in most of the short stories and the play which Miss Irwin has collected in this volume. She has certainly employed all her arts in this endeavour. and with considerable success but one begins to weary of witches and black cats before the end. In one tale, The Earlier Service, Miss Irwin succeeds particularly well in creating an atmosphere of horror. The scene is an old country church occupied by an infamous fourteenth-century rector - he becomes fifteenth-century later on, but that is not so probable - who had been tried for celebrating the black mass and delivering delectable children to slay them at the altar. The present rector's daughter is acutely conscious of this presence and is driven on by it. Another story with a modern setting, of a man who found on his own bookshelves a manuscript of Satanic inspiration and fell completely under its spell, is equally grim, though scarcely so powerful. Faceted Desire is a little play showing Miss de Francesca dying and battling with the evil memories of her youth and dabbling in sorcery. Mr. Cork has no magic in it, but it is a piece of blisteringly bad journalism and is as horrible in its tone as any of the others. Those who enjoy having their flesh made to bleed by bugs of one sort or another will find this an excellent specimen of that class of literature.",,

A STUDY OF ADOLESCENCE
THE EAST WIND OF LOVE. By CObMl'TON
MACKENZIE. Rich and Cowan. Us. 6d. Such is the strength of popular ridicule that it requires courage to take calf-love seriously. Yet popular attitudes are often as shallow as popular people. Leave conventional judgment for a moment and reflect, shyly if need be, upon your own experience; you will admit that first love has a pathetic, transparent honesty that should outweigh whatever charges of silliness and sentimentality subsequent experience may bring against it. It has also this, which may be considered of importance: where later emotions may influence happiness and perhaps events, those first ephemeral passions touch character at its most malleable.
It is with this formative period in a man's life that Mr. Mackenzie deals in the first part of the book to be called ""The Four Winds of Love,"" and he does youth th( justice to suppose that minds as weil as emotions are being evolved. But in an intelligent boy like John Ogilvie leaving school at the turn of the century, it would have been surprising if the mind were not even more disturbed than the body. The death of the Queen seemed to promise an end of the Victorianism against which at any time, and at that time particularly, intelligent youth must rebel. Not that Ogilvie was yet actively and deliberately in revolt, but there was such an influx of ideas that must be examined before he could accept either the established or the potential.
Since he is seventeen when the book opens, these ideas are inextricably caught up with his ideas about women. But life blows cold upon youth in love; and when that wildly unpractical lyric love for Rose Medlicott is forbidden he recovers the sooner for knoWing that he could never have settled down to marriage among the squirearchy. It is typical both of his age and of the time, that his intimacy with Miriam Stern, who was cultured, widelv experienced, and old enough to be his mother, should give him more real satisfaction. Here, by conventional standards, Mr. Mackenzie treads dangerous ground, but he is writing so seriously that conventional standards appear as trivial as any of the brief, almost anecdotal. ep.sodes from which he accumulates so effectively a comprehensive though preliminary account of a contemporary.
THE IRISH FAMINE
FAMINE. By LIAM O'FLAHERTY. Gollancz.
8s. 6d.
After six or seven hours with the reality of Mr. O'Flaherty's Ireland one emerges into the comparative, but nevertheless still comforting, daylight of the present with bewilderment and a guilty feeling of relief. The people of the book are peasants onc never knew, and the year is 1845; even if the people were real they are now far beyond one's power to help; and still this feeling of oppression continues. The blight still hangs, like a solitary and supernatural cloud, over the promising harvest of the valley; the "" peelers "" are searching the glens for Mary Kilmartin's husband who is wanted for a murder of despair; in their anxiety to relieve the consequences of famine and pestilence the priests are divided among themselves, and the people trudge hopelessly to and from the village for the food that might save them. It is a terrifying effcct, which outruns the means employed to achieve it, and the heartbreaking muddle of incompetence, greed, folly, and misguided heroism is lifted high above the conN'entional limitations of an historical novel. Nor is it only harrowing. The fatalism of the peasant in the face of calamity is thrown aside energetically at thc merest glimmer of hope, and the indomitable will to survive carries Mary and her child cven to an unknown America rather than subside with the rest of the valley into miserv and death.
JAMES VI AND I
MINE IS THE KINGCDOM. By JANE OLIVER.
Collins. Ss. 6d.
A study of the least attractive but not the least interesting of the Stewart Kings, James VI and I, from the pre-natal s'.ock ol Rizzio's murder through the turnwiiis anid cumberis of his minority; his struggles with Spain, England, the Pope of Rome, and that nearcr Pope of Scotland, Andrew Melville; the odd ove.s as adventure of his wooing,; the mattei of the Bonny Earl of Moray and the darker tale of the Gowrie Conspiracy; a glimpsc of the mad epilogue to the Three Hundred Years War; and so to Carey's ride through the March weather to announce the succession to a second CrowU. Miss Oliver has based her slozy on a thorough and genuine study of the time, but the scholarship checks and guides, not overweights it. A reader ignorant of the period will find an exciting tale of complex character and fantastic event, and one who knows enough to realize how closely the author has kept to actual fact will enioy still more her analysis of possible (and very probable) motive, the plausible imaginative filling that she contrives for the gaps in what is known. and the series c-f very convincing portraits. In spite of certain slightly jarring modernisms of language, no one interested in the-Scofland of Queen Mary, or in strange psychology and violent action, is likely to read without keen interest.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS286208044/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=410840b0,"New novels are a study of the adolescence of the young.

It is a terrifying effect, which outruns the means employed to achieve it, and the muddle of incompetence, greed, and folly is lifted high above the ordinary limitations of an historical novel. It is not only harrowing. The narcissism of the poor man in the face of calamity is tossed aside with an energy and the glimmer of hope, and the indomitable will to live brings Mary and her children to an unknown land rather than surrender themselves to the rest of the world in mourning and death. JAMES VI AND JAMES XIX IN THE KINGDOM. By Janet Collins. New York. SS. 6d. A study of the least attractive but not the least interesting of the three kings, James VI and James, from the pre-natal suck of Rizzio's murder through the turnips and cumberbashes of his minority struggles with Spain, England, the Pope of Rome, and the nearer Pope of Scotland, Andrew Melville explores the odd adventures of his wife, the murder of the Countess of Monmouth and the dark tale of the Gowry Conspiracy and a glimpse of the madness of the Three Centuries War and the rise of Charles II to power in the United Kingdom. Miss Oliver has based her story on a thorough and genuine study of the time, but the historical accuracy and context do not overshadow it. A reader ignorant of the period will find an exciting tale of complex character and fantastic events, and one who knows enough to realize how closely the author has kept to actual fact. will enjoy even more his analysis of possible and very probable motives, the imaginative filling that he provides for the gaps in what is known. and the series of very convincing portraits. In spite of certain slightly jarring modernisms of language, no one interested in the so-called ""story of Mary Magdalene, or in strange psychological phenomena and violent action, is likely to read it without keen interest.",,

"" What is fantasy ? "" To this might be altered the most famous question in history; war and politics have sanctioned the change. Each incredible alliance, each further invasion is harder t6 believe in, and since truth seems determined to fly in the face of what is likely, let us at least enjoy the holiday she gives us. It is an appropriate time to return to written fantasy, which at any rate harms no one. Disbelief is suspended here as well: we must make the most of Munchausen and his fellows. But there is another and more subtle department of fantasy, one in which the preposterous, like a good caricature, reveals some features of the actual. The latest addition to this is a curious and fascinating comedy by Mr. Peter de Polnay.
It may be said at once that CHILDREN, MY CHILDREN gives as controversial a picture of the child mind as "" A High Wind in Jamaica"" did. Life here is on two planes. There is the superficial fantasy of the beastly, black-browed Mr. Nicholas, whose wife shoots herself because she is refused a divorce; and there is.the funny, attractive, and, it seems, perfectly serious record of his children's thoughts. The loss of his wife is the least of Mr. Nicholas's concerns, once he has persuaded himself that she never meant to leave him. He is a villain in the best tradition, boastful, opinionated, selfish, and wanton; he is always ready to make love to a governess, or believe himself wronged by a mistress who grows wearisome; and, since it is 1914, he wears a moustache. For all his vagaries the children must provide their own explanations, and Mr. de Polnay gives the most lively and persuasive account of the way in which small children rationalize the absurd behaviour of the grown-up world. He knows that at the age of eight or nine one is ignorant of the stupid motives of one's elders, and that one credits them instead with motives that seem reasonable to oneself. Munmny, who has Ivor and Molly and Edith to' love, can have no reason for shooting herself: therefore Father, whom they all fear and dislike, must have shot her; and the idea persists. The three children are quite distinct, and as the absorbing story proceeds they seem to grow. It is a remarkably good mixture of the ridiculous and the hardheaded.
NINE NOVELS
Of the nine stories and novels in Mr. Louis Bromfield's collection, two have appeared before, those entitled ""Better than Life"" and "" McLeod's Folly."" The rest have various scenes and subjects but are united in dealing, one may fancy, less with the real world than with a story-book one. Thus a prince's mistress, devoted to him but long in exile, finds him again in New York, where the lovers perish in an hotel fire. Or an actress in New York in the nineties is such a very good sort that she makes love to a poor little English valet just to make up to him for an unhappy upbringing. Or a well-to-do neurotic gentleman, who has tried in vain to forget a lady he might very well have married, finds sanctuary at last in an exotic and decaying seaside village and has just married a half-caste when the lady from his past reappears with a rich, elderly, and unpleasant husband. In situations such as these it will not be the author's fault if nothing happens, and, indeed, the chief merit of the stories is their eventfulness. Mr. Bromfield is never at a loss for an anecdote or a scene in passing or a bit of local colour, and in "" New York Legend,"" the one about the prince's mnistress, quite the most interesting parts of the story are connected with persons not essential to it. His people, however, have one fault-they are seldom rebellious. They do as they are told, and in rather an interesting way; but it is only in one or two of them-Mees Opp, for instance, in "" Bitter Lotus ""-that the character seems alive and only waiting till the author's back is turned.
AN EAST END DRAPER
There is rather more humanity in THEY NVON'T LET You LIVE, though Mr. Simon Blumenfeld is not so accomplished a storyteller. He, too, uses slightly fantastic means, though he is seriously concerned for his people. They are the Curries, shopkeepers in the East End for three or four generations. In 1939, however, small drapers have to face great competition, and Currie's is on the road to ruin. Mr. Blumenfeld shows the present shopkeeper trying to reconcile his faith in honesty and plain dealing with what his son recognizes as an inevitable development in commerce. Currie fails and, after such desperate stratagems as backing horses, he shoots himself. It is all rather sad, but beneath the earnestness one perceives the author's sincere concern for the unfortunate, and for this one is disposed to be sympathetic. At least he regards writing as something more than a means to gain a living. But there are passages in which he forgets the injustice of life and sees about him a life that does not run in conventional channels, a life in which even the victims fail to dwell on their misfortunes; and in these he promises more.
The last is a frail and pleasant piece. Miss LAVINGTON is a story for those who prefer not to be racked, or even upset, by their reading. A woman returns after 50 years to the scene of her childhood and youth, and the first thing she does is to cry ""Edward ! "" and faint. This is because she opens a door and sees, dressed ready to play a part in Milestones, the living image of the man she might have married. After the first faint Miss Lavington controls herself, and on the whole she is pleased, though her memories are vivid enough for her to be also a little jealous, when her niece falls in love with the present Edward Wheatley. It is an ambling, amiable book, made up of new events in old associations, and it depends on the theory that the old believe themselves to be very old. Miss Lavington is only in her sixties, but any one would believe she had played with Miss Yonge:

NINOVELS Of the nine stories and novels in Mr. Louis Barlow's collection, two have appeared before, those titled 'Better than Life and 'Leopolds'. The rest have various scenes and subjects but are united in a feeling, one may fancy, less with the real world than with a story-book one. Thus a prince's mistress, devoted to him but long in exile, finally discovers him in New York, where the lovers are trapped in a hotel fire.

“ A GOLFING PRODIGY.”
Mr. Mark Allerton is a pleasant writer, with a preference for dealing with the philosophy of life in general under the name of golf rather than with the more technical aspects of the game.
In the earlier part of his book he has acted up to this sound principle so very thoroughly that the golfing reader begins to accuse him of false pretences. Here is a book bound in green, called The Girl on the Green (Methuen, 6s.), and adorned with ""a representation of a bag of clubs, and no word of golf till the neighbourhood of page 80 is reached. Instead there is a mildly engaging young lady, Miss Frances Eveleigh, froin the College of Barton, who has been sufficiently interested in the suffrage movement to break a window*- and a cheerful, slangy - young gentleman;-""the Hon. -’James Beverly, against whom there is ""nothing whatever to be said, except that we are not surprised to hear that his father is the first rather than the
tenth baron. Then putting greens begin to be made, suffragists attempt, under cover of darkness, to destroy them, and the heroine, by means of some rather ingenious plotting, is suspected of the outrage, Meanwhile she has been learning golf under the eye of Mr. Beverly—who, it appears, has reached the semi-final of the amateur championship—and falling in love with him at the same time, although refusing him most stoutly, as she does in different chapters a number of other and far less attractive gentlemen.
It is only when these two are engaged, and the love interest conscientiously disposed of, that the reader gets his full money’s worth of golf. Suddenly a great match is arranged between Mr. Beverly and Miss Eveleigh in which the gentleman is to concede the odds of a half. It is played before crowds of spectators, amid terrific excitement, and, after a dramatic finish, is won by the hero by a single hole. The description of the match, or some part of it, is conceived in a frankly farcical vein. It is therefore perhaps pedantic to boggle at possibilities; but really the male golfing sense of what is credible does overcome our sense of humour and compel us to utter a matter-offact protest, with which the author, being a Scotsman, may covertly sympathize. A few years ago a match was played at Stoke Poges between teams of male and female players of considerable repute, and the men giving a half won comfortably. Yet here a young lady who only a.few months from her first holding a golf club can not only win a county championship with a score of 75, but at the aforesaid odds of a half take to the very last hole on. a long seaside course the favourite for the male amateur championship.
This is surely the most remarkable achievement of its kind since a gentleman in “ The Lady of the Lake ” cleared eighteen feet with a standing long jump. It is very entertaining, but it really won’t do,

A GOLF PRODUCER. Mr. Mark Allerton is a pleasant writer, with a preference for dealing with the philosophy of life in general under the name of golf rather than with the more technical aspects of the game. In the earlier part of his book he has acted up to this sound principle so very vigorously that the golfing reader begins to accuse him of false pretenses. Here is a book bound in green, called The Girl on the Green Menhaden, 6s., adorned with a representation of a bag of clubs, and no word of golf until the vicinity of page 80 is reached. Instead there is a mildly engaging young lady, Miss Frances Ewell, from the College of Barton, who has been sufficiently interested in the suffrage movement to break a window- and a cheerful, slangy- young gentleman-the Hon.-James Beverly, against whom there is nothing whatever to be said, except that we are not surprised to hear that his father is the first rather than the tenth baron. Then putting greens begin to be made, and suffragists attempt, under cover of darkness, to destroy them, and the heroine, by means of some rather ingenious plotting, is suspected of the outrage, Meanwhile she has been learning golf under the eye of Mr. Beverly, who, it appears, has reached the semi-final of the amateur championship and is falling in love with him at the same time, although resisting him most strongly, as she does in different chapters a number of other more attractive gentlemen. It is only when these two are engaged, and the love affair is conscientiously dissected, that the reader gets his full money's worth of golf.

It is played before crowds of spectators, in tremendous excitement, and, after a dramatic finish, is won by the hero by a single shot.

It is perhaps dangerous to boggle at the possibilities of golfing success, but the real sense of what is credible does overcome our sense of humour and compels us to utter a matter-of-fact protest, with which the author, being a Scotsman, may covertly sympathise. A few years ago a match was played at Stoke Park between teams of men and female players of considerable repute, and the men gave a half-way win.

As for the story, men and women of charm are grouped together in an opulent circle. The atmosphere is unrefined and unfiltered. Nobody has any special object--in life beyond being decently turned out and properly vested, and all that seems to be designed to secure a delightful world. But there is still room for a serious theme and a delicate problem. Marriage is the question. Ignorance of physical marriage is the crux. Fancy Beaumont, devoted to her brothers, in love with her family life, chooses to marry Sir Malcolm Kinross without knowing what she is doing. Such is her lack of knowledge that she refracts in horror from contact with reality. Daisy Pierpoint--her friend, on the other hand, learns the pleasure-pains of life's chief secret less frequently, with less resentment at the time, and with a rebellion, perhaps only as an afterthought, which brings about a delay in the story. With Fanny and Bess, in the foreground, the reader will be aware of the stirrings of nature. with much pleasure, though perhaps they will wonder why the Lady did so much. This is not because the thing itself is impossible by any means, but because Fanny is a person who is true enough to type in herself not to attempt to antagonize the immutable laws of nature to require the sacrifice of the unfortunate Malcolm and his immediate effacement. That struck us as somewhat artificial, all the more because it is a prelude to Fanny's awakening after a suitable delay at the time. at the bidding of the dead man. Yet it catches our attention, and its restraint in this 7-year-old novel is quite convincing, given the other characters who circle around the author. The poor woman who is making this novel is just about as pretty as she can be.",,

There is a certain outlandishness, admirable when it is merely of plot and setting, injudicious perhaps where it touches character, to be found in each of the five novels reviewed below. Each is off the well-worn track, but whether for good or ill depends upon the destination for which the individual author is making. Mrs. Buck, at any rate, is in no doubt about hers. The Heaven of the Old Testament is the only conceivable end for so rampageous an angel as Andrew Stone, for whom the mission-field in China is as a battlefield in God's war and the enemy to be routed alternately the devil of ignorance or human opposition. Born of a narrow, pugnacious, egotistical Southern family, he was bound to bully and fight in whatever calling he chose, and when it chanced to be that of evangelist he left America and applied that vast energy and indomitable obstinacy to the subjugation of the foreign heathen. That was years before the Boxer Rising, when China was comparatively new country for this rather equivocal kind of crusade; and for 50 years Andrew sacrificed himself and his family to the propagation of the Gospel.
It was easy for him. He had a single purpose and wvas consumed by a flame that sustained him even while it gave him no rest. The suspicious regularity with which God's will matched his own was a coincidence he never noticed. Had it not been for his wife, whose story was related in an earlier book, his own family might have been in a far worse case than the Chinese he loved. In spite of the vigorous irony, which the author handles with so much care and so greatly to our satisfaction, the flame burns with assurance, flickering a little before the prospect of meeting Jehovah face to face, but disturbed by no earthly wind and illumining, as Mrs. Buck intended, the portrait of a soul that admitted no human responsibility.
A SCIENTIFIC ""THRILLER""
Mr. Macpherson's ingenious and extremely stimulating scientific "" thriller "" comes out with the emphasis on a point directly opposite. Plant three modern people upon an island in the St. Lawrence -a brilliant young English scientist, say, his lively and intelligent wife, and a friendly Canadian journalist who has sensibly put aside his former passion for the lady-subject them to a series of what look like magical attacks, and a man will still, in spite of science, culture and a healthy cynicism, act like an animal in an emergency and fight for the woman to whom he is married. And they are very curious attacks, this owl that defies the canon of its kind and flies at their eyes, these phantoms of a knight in armour and a merciless lady, the butler and handyman who dances under hypnotism, these voices in mid air that bawl at the lady and the journalist horrible distortions of their own thoughts. So well contrived is the atmosphere of uncertainty and dread that can becloud the minds of even reasonable people in extraordinary circumstances that the explanation, however ingenious scientifically, comes as an anticlimax, and it requires all the rest of the adventure, the voyage through the Thousand and One Islands and the frightful, visible reconstruction of a single indiscretion to restore our interest in a most original fantasy for the enjoyment of reasonable people.
It is another kind of terror that stalks through the two stories in "" Murder for Love."" In one a young girl whose life is made wretched by a bestial and drunken grandmother gives her an overdose of sleeping draught: in the other a frustrated wife whose chastity, like her husband's, is bound up with all sorts of prohibitions. knifes the man. But the terror lies not in these, by the standards of fiction rather commonplace incidents, but in the madness that follows or begets them. Both set up in the reader the same inquiry: Can one safely deduce the emotions of lunacy from the emotions of a normal woman ? Miss Salt has followed the same course in both cases by trying to enter the mind of the lunatic and inviting us to share her dread of the twilit world in which she wanders. We concede the horror in theory but actually are little moved. When there is so much to engross a novelist and his readers in the world that directly touches us a flight into a region where all is dark. melancholy and. at best, extremely problematical must be made magnificently before it can command attention.
ARDEN BEFORE ROSALIND
Even without this contrast "" One Man's Holiday"" is deliciously normal, so normal, indeed, that it sinks at times to the ordinary. Only the frailest skeleton of plot-a young Englishman on holiday in Greece, a Greek girl and a matchmaking friend-distinguishes the tale from an informal, tentative and sometimes very amusing travel book. The young man-whose name, by the way, is Parker-travels to Greece, of which, very engagingly, he knows nothing, by cargo steamer; he motors over bad roads, he learns to open a conversation with a remark on politics instead of on the weather, he has miniature adventures of the type the usual tourist experiences, and he throws off at length the shyness of a conventional young man whose life till now has been passed between an accountants office and a bachelor flat. It gives an agreeable view of modern Greek life and an amiable picture of the people, and it is politely and humorously written; but Mr. Dickson has still to write a novel.
Though Mr. Phillpotts's latest romance is officially set in England, in the "" Blore "" country, it might very well be in the Limberlost or some other large and romantic wood. Though the song of the cardinal is not to be heard, a little girl makes friends with the trees in the best Limberlost manner, and life in general, even to the shuffling off of an unwise marriage, has a felicitous simplicity absent from life in
ordinary society. There is an old wisc woman and her beautiful, colcd son, who adopt the little girl whose father has married again and, to her mind as well as his, uncomfortably. The child is fond of sermons, particularly those found in trees; and with its handful of rustics and the kindly, rather academic clergyman, the whole thing has something of the peaceful monotony of life in Arden before the arrival of Rosalind.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS118435887/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=109885d4,"New novels by Peter Buchanan.

EVER GAZED at the handsome black spine of a Penguin Classic and thought, ""Now , how could I write one of those?"" Well, if you have, you're in luck — Nigel Wilcockson, publisher of Penguin Classics, has the formula. ""I once tried to come up with a sort of recipe for how to write a classic novel — ie, a novel that would still be read in 100 years' time. So, to start with, it's very dangerous to write only one book — though Alain Fournier got away with it But don't write too many, either, because people stop taking you seriously: look at Edgar Wallace. It doesn't get you very far being an innovator; 100 years later, people might think, what's so innovative about that? And,"" — a warning for those follow - ing a current literary vogue — ""don't write his - torical novels. The more I look at it, the more I think they date. In the same way, if you look at costume drama from the 1970s, it looks like the 1970s. People don't read old historical novels be - cause it's not true about the period if s meant to be addressing, and it's not quite talking about the period if s written in, either. Genre novels are a good idea: so I think that Agatha Christie will still be read in 50 years, but Catherine Cook - son will be out of print"" He laughs. ""Thafs my rather dangerous prediction!"" But then, with a more serious look, he admits that this is a recipe not everyone can follow. ""There is one problem — the last thing is, you have to be a genius. "" Wilcockson, 41, is talking to me in his com -
"" AGATHA CHRISTIE WILL BE READ IN 50 YEARS' TIME, BUT CATHERINE COOKSON MAY WELL BE OUT OF PRINT"" fortable office in Penguin's fine new home on the Strand — if you crane your neck in looking out his window, you can see the river, Westmin - ster , the Millennium Wheel. I've come because the relaunch of Penguin Classics — the first re - launch in 16 years, only the fourth in the series' history — has made me wonder if ""classic texts"" aren't something we're in danger of taking just a little too much for granted. Penguin Classics were initally lauched in a spirit of postwar en - thusiasm — the classicist and publisher E. V.
Rieu had spent his idle hours during service in the Second World War perfecting his transla - tion of Homer's Odyssey (""its revision was un - dertaken to the sound of VI and V2 explosions and the crash of shattering glass,"" he wrote); he read it aloud to his wife Nelly, who encouraged him to try to get it published. Allen Lane not only took the leap, but also invited Rieu to edit a series of classics; a decision that was surely an act of faith, but one that was soon vindicated:
PENGUIN'S TOP TEN CLASSIC SELLERS Jane Austen: Emma lane Austen: Pride and Prejudice Emily Bronte: Wuthering Heights Charlotte Bronte: Jane Eyre Geoffrey Chaucer: The Canterbury Tales Charles Dickens: Great Expectations Homer The Odyssey Nlccolo Machlavelli: The Prince Plato: The Republic Mary Shelley: Frankenstein
since 1946 Rieu's Odyssey has sold nearly three million copies — the bestselling Penguin until it was eclipsed by Lady Chatterley's Lover 15 years later. But surely things are different now, and Wil - cockson 's position is very different from Lane's. The ""classic books"" — we all know what they are, don't we? Wikockson's job must be a pretty cushy one, don't you think? Just a matter of slap - ping on some swish new covers and Bob's your uncle? Fortunately, when"" I put it to the genial Wilcockson in this way, he guesses there's some irony in my tone. ""Well , ifs true to say that you don't have many rows with authors! But there's much more to it than that If you want to create a se - ries that people are going to get excited by, what you can't do is just say what the top 40 books are, put new jackets on them and put them out The Penguin Classics editors have thought really imaginatively how to build cer - tain authors and experiment in differentgenres. For example, if you look at what sensational novels of the 19th century Penguin was publish - ing 20 years ago, it was Wilkie Collins's The Moonstone and The WomanJn~Whit£, thafs it
But then novels of sensation become fashiona - ble academically; so we start to look at one or two other novelists, and other Wilkie Collins novels , too — like No Name, which is brilliant And with Mary Braddon [Aurora Floyd, The Doctor 's Wife, Lady Audley's Secret] you get a
NIGEL'S GREAT UNSUNG BOOKS Tobias Smollett: Humphry Clinker (1771) Funny, earthy and often rather mad. George Glsslng: New Grub Street (1891) Compelling exploration of Victorian literary London. Wllkle Collins: No Name (1862) One of the most exciting suspense novels yet written. Ivan Goncharov: Oblomov (1859) Witty and extraordinarily touching.

woman's take on the sensational novel. So you can start seeing a shape. Now thafs not how it will hit you in the bookshop, but the back - ground is there. Penguin are willing to take a risk when they think there's an area worth ex - ploring ."" Interesting to note how such a seem - ing ly specialist path can lead into popular litera - ture : for where would Sarah Waters be without Collins and Braddon behind her? And while ""new"" and ""classic"" aren't neces - sarily words one thinks of in the same breath, Penguin are always expanding: 60 new Penguin Classics appear, on average, every year. This year will see the publication of an edition of the Homeric Hymns, de Tocqueville 's Democracy in America, a collection of Greek sophists — to name a few. Within the next year or so there will be major new translations of War and Peace, Hans Christian Andersen's Fairy Tales, and Ovid's Metamorphoses . It is this depth and breadth — Penguin Clas - sics have around 850 titles in print—that distin - guish the list from most others. Competition in the classics field is not new — as Wilkinson points out, the Everyman library goes back to 1906, the Oxford World's Classics to 1901—but
NIGEL WILCOCKSON, IMPASSIONED PUBLISHER OF PENGUIN CLASSICS, TALKS GREAT LITERATURE WITH ERICA WAGNER
<NEWPAGE>
Penguin's commitment to both scholars and general readers is what has distinguished its books. What comes across most in talking to Wilcockson is what he must share with Lane and Rieu: a real commitment to the books un - der his care, a willingness to make a tremen - dous effort to—if s not too.excessive a compari - son — spread the gospel. He has, for instance, developed a passion for George Gissing, which he admits at the moment that almost no one shares: ""but all that's going to change next year"" when Gissing comes under the umbrella of the relaunch. Of course, you can't make people buy books, and there's no guarantee of success: Ms concern is genuine when he notes a change in fashion. The Canterbury Tales remains a strong seller, he tells me, but Troilus and Criseyde sells a fifth as many copies as it did 30 years ago. He fears for the fate of medieval literature. ""Occasionally you get people invoking this terrible word 'relevance' when talking about lit - erature ; and it just makes me want to go and stick my head in the oven. I've heard it a lot late - ly about medieval literature and if s a pernicious thing. No one will stop reading The Canterbury Tales , but it gets harder and harder to enthuse people about the area around it. It's as though everyone should be writing manuals for how to drive a Ford Mondeo, because that's 'relevant."" We both note in despair that it's even a misuse of the word: relevant to what?
""PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THE 'RELEVANCE' OF CLASSICS MAKES ME WANT TO STICK MY HEAD IN THE OVEN""
Yet if you insist upon ""relevance"", you need only turn to the back of the relaunched edition of Herodotus. Wilcockson has been insistent where blurbs for the new books are concerned: Penguin's mission is to arouse, not assume, in - terest , to try to give the reader a sense of the book and not just convey that it's something that should be read ""because if s good for you"". To that end, a quote from the book is always in - cluded on the coven ""No one is fool enough to choose war instead of peace — in peace sons bury fathers, but in war fathers bury sons"", the ancient historian remarked. What could be more relevant to our present situation than that? Of course, no list is complete, and Wilcock - son is forthright about the gaps in the Penguin list; he notes a dearth of Far Eastern and tradi - tional Jewish texts — even things closer to home, like German Romantic literature: there's Goethe, but not much Schiller. Rectifying such gaps can be slow, and an academic impetus can be needed to help to get things off the ground. And the process of ""becoming a classic"", pace Wilcockson's formula, is a slow and mysterious one.
""What is a classic? We use three criteria, real - ly : one is this terribly difficult thing, of some - thing being 'a great book' — thaf s part deter - mined by survival"", it's self-selecting . Then you have the books that are just wonderful reads: that Orwell described as 'good bad books', like those of Wilkie Collins. He's not Tolstoy, but he's wonderful to read Then there are books that tell you something about the time that they were written. That goes right back to the begin - ning of the idea of the classics, with Greek and Latin. I don't think Xenophon is a great, great writer, but you read him because you find out about the Persian expedition, say. And I think thaf s something that's increasingly important, especially as we have got very nervous about talking about 'a canon'. But the great books thing is the mystery. No one knows what makes a great book. It would be sad if we did."" Wilcockson's delight — and the delight of his readers — is that we all must keep looking for them, even when we think they are under our noses. Books that speak across ages and cul - tures , from Gilgamesh to Middlemarch: ""classic"", where a literature is concerned, means not lost in its time, but something perpetually new.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0501556698/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=f4b8b26b,"CLASSICS? A PIECE OF GENIUS NEEDED! Ever glanced at the spine of a Penguin classic and thought, ""Hmm, how could I write one of those?"" Well, if you have, you're in luck - Nigel Wilcockson, publisher of Penguin Classics, has the formula. I once tried to come up with a sort of recipe for how to write a classic novel, i.e. a novel that would still be read in 100 years time. So, to start with, it's very dangerous to write only one book, though Alain Frédéric got away with it. But don't write too many books, either, because people might stop taking you seriously like Edgar Wallace. It doesn't get you very far being an innovator 100 years later, and people might think, what's so innovative about that? And, a warning to those following a current literary vogue - don't read historical novels. The more I look at it, the more I think it's outdated. In the same way that if you look at a costume drama from the 70s, it looks like the 70s. People do not read old historical novels because it is not true about the period it is meant to be addressing, and it is not quite talking about the period in which it is written. Genre novels are a good idea so I think that Agamemnon will be read in 50 years, but Catherine Cookson will be out of print. He laughs. That is my rather dangerous prediction! But then, with a more serious look, he admits that this is a recipe not everyone can follow. There is one problem with this - you have to be a genius. Nigel Wilkson, 41, is talking to me in his office - Agamemnemon will be written in 50 years time, but 'Casabianca' will be out in ten years' time. In fact, if you look at the cover of Rall's new book, you will see that it is printed in black and white, with the word ""MAY"" in the middle. Because of the relaunch of the Penguin Classics series, the first in 16 years, the fourth in the series, the history has made me wonder if classic texts are something that we are just taking a little too much for granted. Penguin Books were originally published in a sort of postwar neo-classical tradition - the solipsist and the classicist E.V. Rieu had spent his entire service in the Second World War perfecting his trans-lation of Homer's Odyssey - a work that was unaffected by the sound of war-torn voices and the shattered glass of his deathbed, he wrote it down and read it aloud to his wife, who encouraged him to try to get it published. Allen Lane not only took the lead, but also invited Rieu to edit a series of classics, a decision that was surely an act of faith, but one that was soon justified. PENGUINS TEN CLASSIC SELLERS: Jane Austen, Lady Penelope, Pride and Prejudice, Emily Dickens, The Wrath of God, The Odyssey, Marco Polo, The Prince, The Republic, Mary Shelley, and The Lady of Green Gables Since 1946, The Odyssey has sold nearly three million copies. making it the best-seller in the United Kingdom. But surely things are different now, and Wil-Chuckson's position is very different from that of Lenny. The classic books we know and love are the ones we buy. Weirdos's job must be a pretty sketchy one, don't you think? Just a matter of slapping on some shiny new covers and making your uncle laugh? Fortunately, when I put it to the general reader in this way, he guesses there is some irony in my tone. Well, it is true that you do not have many friends with authors! But there's much more to it than that If you want to create a series that people are going to get excited about, what you can do is just say what the top 40 books are, put new jackets on them and put them out The Penguin Classics editors have thought really imaginatively about how to build certain authors and experiment with different genres. For example, if you look at what the most sensational novels of the 19th century were published by Penguin Books 20 years ago, it was Wilkie Collins's The Moonstone and The Woman in Water, but that was it. But then, when novels of sensation become fashionable, we start to look at other novels by other authors, and other Wilkie Collins novels, too, like No. 1 (Brunetto Latini), The Doctor's Wife, Lady Macdonald's Secret, you get a sense. like. Tobias Smollett and Humphrey Calvin are two great unpublished books. Thomas Jefferson, The New Yorker 1891. Funny, earthy and often rather mad. New York's Updike 1891. Wilkie Collins's No. 1 is one of the most exciting suspense novels ever written. Ivan Goncharov and Othello are both excellent. Guy de Maupassant is at his nihilist best in this tale of the utterly unscrupulous George Dudley. Women take over the sensational novel. So you can start to see a shape. Now that's not how it will hit you in the bookshop, but the back-story is there. Penguin are willing to take a risk when they think there is an area worth exploring. It is interesting to note how such a strange-sounding specialty can lead to popular literature - for where would Sarah Waters be without Collins and Blake behind her? And while new and classic books aren't necessarily going to be popular, there are always new Penguin classics that appear, on average, every year. This year will see the publication of an edition of the Homeric hymns, de Tocqueville's Democracy in America, a collection of Greek sophists to name a few. Within the next year or so there will be major new translations of War and Peace, Henry Andersen's Fairy Tales, and Ovid's Metamorphoses. It is this depth and breadth in which Penguin Books has 850 titles in print that distinguishes them from other publishers. the classics field is not new, as Wilkinson points out, but the Everyman's Library goes back to 1906, the Oxford World's Latin Centaur goes back to 1901, and Nicholson Baker, a passionate publisher of Penguin Books, talks about great literature with erudition and verve. Penguin Books' commitment to both academic and general readers is what distinguishes its books. What comes across most in talking to Wilkinson is what he must share with Lenny and Riddle, a real commitment to the books under his care, a willingness to make a tremendous effort if it is not too expensive to compare and contrast. He has, for instance, developed a passion for George Gisling, which he admits at the moment that almost no one else does but that all that will change next year when Gisling comes under the umbrella of the relaunch. Of course, you can't make people buy books, and there is no guarantee of success, but my genuine concern is when he notices a change in fashion. The Canterbury Tales remains a strong seller, he tells me, but Troilus and Cristopher sells as many copies as it did 30 years ago. He fears for the future of European literature. Occasionally you get people invoking this terrible word of relevance when talking about literature and it just makes me want to go and stick my head in the oven. I've heard a lot about it lately and it is a pernicious thing. will stop reading The Canterbury Tales, but it gets harder and harder to enthuse people about the area around it. It's as though everyone should be writing manuals for how to drive a Ford Mondeo, because that's relevant. We both note with despair that it is even a misuse of the word relevant to what? People talking about the prevalence of classics makes my head hurt. Yet if you insist upon relevance, you need only turn to the back of the relaunched edition of Shakespeare. Wilfrid Spenser has been insistent in his blurbs for the new books where the Penguins are concerned. His mission is to arouse, not assume, an interest in the book, to try to give the reader a sense of the book and not just convey that it is something that should be read because it is good for you. To that end, a quote from the book is always included in the context. No one is willing to choose war instead of peace; in war, fathers lose their sons, but in peace, fathers win their sons. What could be more relevant to our present situation than that? Of course, no list is complete, and Wilfrid is forthright about the gaps in the list, noting that he notes a dearth of Persian and traditional Jewish texts and even things closer to home, like German Romantic literature from Homer, but not much of Shakespeare. Retaining such gaps can be slow, slow, and an academic impetus can be needed to help get things off the ground. And the process of becoming a classic, like Wilcox's formula, is a slow and mysterious one. What is a classic? We use three criteria, really - one is this terribly difficult thing, something being a great book that is partly determined by survival - and then there are books that tell you something about the time that they were written. That goes right back to the beginning of the idea of the classics, with Greek and Latin. I don't think Xenophon is a great, great writer, but you read him because you find out about the Persian expedition, say.

The new way forward is back
Palm Pilot Man claimed that the electronic world would kill off books. Not so, Philip Oltermann says. It has simply made us more aware of their beauty
Big is beautiful: TheAtlas Maior of mm
A FEW DAYS AFTER THE London Review Bookshop opened in Bloomsbury two-and-a-half years ago, a salesperson manoeuvred past the lavish display of new hardbacks, stepped up to the counter ofthe manager, Andrew Stilwell, and placed a smooth metal object in front of him. This, he said proudly, was the future of books. Others in the queue held their breath. A Palm Pilot. Thank you, but no it wasn't, Stilwell said. They sold Gameboys down the road. The Palm Pilot Men talk with much confidence about publishing these days. The era of the printed page, they claim, is ending. The future is digital, paperless and Bluetooth-compatible. Bill Gates insists that Microsoft's portable Tablet PC — launched in 2002 — could render traditional publishing obsolete in four to five years. But take any of the apostles of the e-book to a bookshop this Christmas and they might lose some of their swagger. They may pick up the new McSweeney's Quarterly, for example. The American author Dave Eggers's playful, experimental journal for fiction, now on its sixteenth issue, has perfected the old-fashioned, dusty tome look: these are books that look like books. The latest is a cheeky foldout number, complete with a pack of playing cards and comb. They may also chance upon
Taschen's table-sized Atlas Maior of 1665, a reprint of Joan Blaeu's baroque masterpiece of mapmaking. The original's 596 maps came in 11 volumes, and kept Blaeu's copperplate presses busy for 1,600 days. Perhaps it is just coincidence that Taschen decided to republish it in the year that Google launched its virtual globe project, Google Earth. At £100 a copy, it doesn't come cheap, but then the price has symbolic value: quality doesn't sell for £99.99. The result of an even more painstaking labour of love is Audrey Niffenegger's The Three Incestuous Sisters. Her bestselling novel The Time Traveler's Wife took five years to travel from the conception of its title to the bookshelves in Sainsbury's — no time at all, compared with her visual tale of jealous siblings, ghostly ancestors and flying babies. Using aquatint, she spent 14 years making ten copies. Before Cape decided to publish a cheaper mass market version, they sold for around £1,000 each. Collector's edition chic is also in vogue: Zadie Smith's On Beauty, for example, comes complete with beautifully patterned endpapers — a design quirk that one used to find almost exclusively in special editions. Even the booklets in Penguin's ""Great Ideas"" series, with their proud typography and ornamental frames, look like the sort of thing that one would pick
up at a fine press fair not a book chain. Waterstone's picked up on the success of internet book auction sites earlier this year and started commissioning special editions from publishers. Commercially successful new titles — from Kazuo Ishiguro to Lauren Bacall — now come with a slightly more expensive collectable twin. Far from pushing traditional bookmaking to the edge, internet publishing seems to have breathed new life into it and reminded it of its strengths. Any of the above titles could make your iBook melt with envy, so self-assured are they in their celebration of the nostalgic, emotive qualities ofthe book as a material object. Simon Prosser, the Penguin editor who decided to publish McSweeney's in Britain, says: ""You can pick them up, put them down, take them to bed, admire the way they've been conserved within their covers, show them off to your friends or smell the distinctive scent of print on paper. Books are sometimes more than the words they contain."" Niffenegger, who has a professorship at the Columbia College Chicago Centre for Book and Paper Arts, agrees that the electronic book is still a long, while away. ""The internet hasn't yet adapted to the human body,"" she says. ""The book is different: even its different parts are named after parts of the human body. You
have the head and the foot of the book, the spine, and the size is adapted to the size of your hands."" This hands-on approach to bookmaking would have struck a chord with William Morris, the late-nineteenth century socialist, textile designer and patron saint of the good page. After the Industrial Revolution, Morris was much concerned with cleaning up British book design; a ""sordid, aimless, ugly confusion"" not a far cry from what reigns on the web today. Is there a return to the spirit of the Arts and Crafts movement? Real typesetters say no: ""What we are dealing with is a return to the oldfashioned style of bookmaking, but not a return to the original principles,"" according to Michael Mitchell, director of Libanus Press and the author of Book Typography: A Designer's Manual. No big publishing house in Britain still prints and typesets its own books, he points out, and with cheap printers available all over the world, the distance between the editorial boardroom and the inkies' workshop is ever increasing. Claire M. Bolton, of Alembic Press in Abingdon, chuckles: ""I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of editors don't even know what a typeface looks like."" But for the big publishers, ""fine"" printing can make commercial sense if executed strategically. The production costs of a reprint are well below that of
the original art book, so experiments such as the Niffenegger book are unlikely to send Cape's sales teams into a panic. The Three Incestuous Sisters h&' boosted her respectability. Profit margins on Waterstone's limited editions are healthy too: with print runs of 1,000, they are ""limited"" only in the faintest sense — rare enough to justify a price rise but available in every branch. Even the lavish Atlas Maior is less of a risk than it seems — Taschen saves money by selling one multilingual edition in different countries. At the London Review Bookshop, Stilwell decided to do things the oldfashioned way when he started publishing a series of special editions this year. He purchased the pages of Julian Barnes's Arthur & George frorn^) Random House and had 125 copies cloth-bound at £50, and 25 with a leather cover at £125. The venture was a success, and the books sold out in ten days. Then the standard hardback edition arrived, they too were clothbound with an old-world engraving. Random House had pastiched the look of a special edition and was selling it for no more than £17.99. ""We wanted to court the bookshop browser, not just the Amazon surfer,"" according to the publisher's sales manager, Tom Drake-Lee.

In his essay on the Epistle to the Hebrews, he shows that the Jewish scriptures had been content to affirm that there was meaning, without defin - ing this too closely, but the New Testament writers insisted they knew exactly what that meaning was. Their single-minded approach inevitably drained the Hebrew stories of rich ambiguity and complexity, but this did not mean the New Testament presented a homogenous message. It included rival theologies, some of which could disturb Christians today. Thus most Christians agree with Paul that Jesus abrogated the Law of Moses and do not, therefore

The Literary Guide to the Bible will not please those who seek fundamentalist certainty in scripture. Indeed, it is a remarkable demonstration of the way the Bible eschews narrow definitions of or - thodoxy by allowing discordant theologies to co-exist and interact' fruitfully. The Guide also fulfils its objective by showing that there is a deep relationship between lit - erature and religion, despite their obvious differences. Art and r£ ligion both attempt a constant creation of meaning , which cannot be achieved by an irritable straining after facts and reason, or confined by sectarian insecurity.

Mark presents Jesus as a folk hero, who blasphemes against authority with a vehemence that would horror the Christian Establishment today. His view of Jesus is closer to Muslim teaching than to Christian orthodoxy, as in the Koran, where Jesus is seen as a Jewish prophet, not the incarnate God. -In the face of this deliberate inconsistency, dogmatic and aggressive interpretations of the Bible are absurd. The Literary Guide to the Bible will not please those who seek fundamentalist certainty in scripture. Indeed, it is a remarkable demonstration of the way the Bible eschews narrow definitions of self-theology by allowing discordant theologies to co-exist and interact fruitlessly. The Guide also fulfils its objective by showing that there is a deep relationship between literature and religion, despite their obvious differences. Arts and religion both attempt to create a continuous chain of meaning, which cannot be achieved by an irritable striving after facts and reason, or by the arbitrary creation of sectarian insecurity.",,

HANDEL RICHARDSON'S
I STORIES
THE END or A CHILDHOOD AND OTHER
STORIES. By HENRY HANDEL RICHARDSON. (Heinemann. 7s. 6d. net.)
Those who have complained-and most even of her greatest admirers have done it at one time or aAother-that Henry Handel Richardson writes at too great length will take up this book of short stories with interest. ""Maurice Guest"" was enormously long, and so was the first of the three books about Richard Mahony. ""The End of a Childhood"" fills fewer than 70 pages, and it proves that this author understands the art of saying much in little. The tale, naturally, will have more in it for those who know what Cuffy Mahony's father was like and something more than what the story tells them about his mother and Henry Ocock, and Tilly. But it is a complete story, complete because of its revelation of a boy's mind and heart, and not the less complete because it leaves the boy on the verge of a new sort of life and does not say what happened to him in it. It achieves precisely what it set out to do, and, like all good short stories of its kind, leaves the rest for the reader to do. Nearly everything in the book, indeed, shows Henry Handel Richardson's skill in that very diflicult task of first seeing what the point is and then of clearing it for the reader to see. The eight little glimpses (they -are not stories) called "" Growing Pains"" seem to peep, with the wisest mixture of reverence, fun, and pity, and then to look quickly away; but in each glimpse we have seen some aspect of girlhood which a duller eye might not have observed for us and a heavier hand might have made us wish we had not seen. Of the other stories, that which best reveals the author's peculiar skill in choosing so much detail as is necessary to her idea, and no more, is "" Mary Christina,"" a study of an old woman's last illness and death and of her thoughts about life as it leaves her. But ""Succedaneum"" will be welcome to many for recalling ""Maurice Guest,"" and showing how the author's art has ripened and refined in the intervening years.
A HANDFUL OF DUST. By EVELYN
WAUGH. (Chapman and Hall. 7s. 6d. net.)
At a guess we should say that Mr. Evelyn Waugh came by the notion that he has developed in ""A Handful of Dust"" during a discussion on the disappearance of Colonel Fawcett in Brazil. Having recently, as we know, spent ""Ninety-two Days"" in those parts, he-however sardonically silent-would be appealed to as an authority when all heroic hypotheses had been exhausted. Thereupon he may have delivered himself of the predicament in which he leaves Tony Last, the chief character in his new novel. To recuperate from marital and other troubles at home, the inept Tony went on a voyage to Georgetown. He allowed himself to be persuaded into accompanying a Waughish explorer. The porters desert, the explorer is drowned, Tony wandering alone is picked up by a Mr. Todd, a Waughish hermit of the bush. Mr. Todd has few possessions except a set of novels of Dickens; he cannot read himself, but he once had a companion who read Dickens aloud to him: So he holds Tony captive to perform for him a like service; and as Tony is quite incapable of travelling alone through the dense bush, he is there for the rest of his days.
The early part of the book is a preparation in the Waughish manner for his finale. In it we have Tony playing the squire on his estate, Hetton Abbey.. The company is the smart set as known to or imagined by Mr. Waugh, and the distinctive feature of his style lies in the smooth detachment with which he chronicles the doings of his iridescent parasites and also their sufferings.
THE CURATE'S WIFE. By E. H. YOUNG.
(Cape. 7s. 6d. net.)
This continuation of the story of Dahlia and Jenny Rendall, begun in "" Jenny NVren,"" will give perfect satisfaction to all Miss Young's readers, old and new. The relations between the sisters have been reversed, and Dahlia is now our chief interest. Her marriage to Cecil Sproat, the curate, is going to be a complete success, but the steps towards success are slow and sometimes painful. Miss Young explains them to us at length with all her accustomed wit and delicate svmpathv. The sublety of the drawing of these two rather touching young people is beyond praise. As a foil to them we have the vicar and his wife. Mrs. Doubleday has made the great mistake all her life of seltisnly idolizing the son who must naturally turn from her some day, and despising the husband who, with all his faults, must be her final refuge. Her natural dislike of youth and charm make her far from kind to Dahlia, whose parrying of her rudeness is delightful comedy. Meanwhile Cecil is hurt by Dahlia's pleasure in Simon Tothill's philandering society and rather jealous of Jenny. How Dahlia by her humour,, her affection, and her young steadfastness regains her Cecil, and how Cecil fights against his less kind thoughts and regains his Dahlia, only Miss Young can tell, without sentiment, yet with strong feeling.
PORTRAIT OF HIS EXCELLENCY. By STEPHEN
McKENNA. (Hutchinson. 7s. 6d. net.)
Mr. McKenna's new novel is a comment on the differences between public report and private experience. He takes the case of Richard Croyle, and by way of presenting the account of him accepted by the world at large, gives as a heading to each of his 12 chapters an excerpt from a fantiliar book of reference: "" Alster, 3rd Viscount . . .""; ""Educated: Eton and Magdalen . . ."", ""Married, 1908, Felicity . . .""; and so on through the list of his services and achievements to his appointment as Governor-General of Australia. The official biography, published after
Lord Alster's death, was founded on such material as this, and added nothing of first importance about the man himself. Mr. McKenna, in the person of Leslie Vivian, now proceeds to tell us the inner history of his friend Dick Croyle's life. It is not by any means a scandalous story. If it had been known to the public it would not have made much difference to Lord Alster's career, but no detail of it could have been inferred from any work of reference or from the official biography. * Mr. McKenna examines sincerely and patiently the springs of motive that with the accidents of circumstance determined the record, and so gives to it an entirely new interpretation. ""Portrait of His Excellency"" is a very honest piece of work, executed with the skill of an cxperienced. craftsman.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS118172452/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=0bd56676,"New England - The New England Tradition and Other Stories. By Henry Handel. Heinemann. 7s. 6d. No. Those who have complained - and indeed most of their greatest admirers have done it at one time or another - that Henry Hartley writes at too great a length will take up this book of short stories with interest. Maurice Guest was enormously long, and so was the first of the three books about Richard Mahony. The End of a Dream fills fewer than 70 pages, and it proves that this author understands the art of saying much in little. The tale, naturally, will have more in it for those who know what Cuckoo's father was like and something more than what the story tells them about his mother and Henry O'Conor, and Miss Tilly. But it is a complete story, complete because it reveals what a boy's mind and heart is like, and not the less complete because it leaves the boy on the verge of a new sort of life and does not say what happened to him in it. It achieves precisely what it sets out to do, and like all good short stories of its kind, it leaves the rest for the reader to do. Everything in the book, indeed, shows how Henry Hartley's skill in the difficult task of seeing what is right and then laying it out for the reader is remarkable. The eight little glimpses of what life is like for a girl in the nineties - and not just for her - seem to me the most wonderful things in the world and the things we wish we had. had not seen. Of the other stories, that which best reveals the author's peculiar skill in choosing so much detail as is necessary to her idea, and no more, is Mary Christina, a study of an old woman's last illness and death and of her thoughts about life as it leaves her. But Success will be welcome to many for recalling Maurice Sender, and showing how his art has ripened and refined in the intervening years. A HANDFUL OF DUST. By EVELYN Waugh. Chapman and Hall. 7s. 6d. At a guess we should say that Mr. Waugh came by the notion that he has developed in A Brief History of the United States during a discussion on the disappearance of Colonel Ford in Brazil. Having recently, as we know, spent ninety-six days in those parts, he - however sardonically - would be appealed to as an authority when all his heroic hypotheses had been exhausted. Thereupon he may have delivered himself of the predicament in which he leaves behind Tommy Last, the chief character in his new novel. To recuperate from marital and other troubles at home, the inept Tony went on a voyage to Georgetown. He allowed himself to be persuaded into accompanying a wheezy explorer. The desert sands, the explorer is killed, and the wandering Tony is picked up by a Mr. Todd, a wandering Waughish hermit of the bush. Mr. Todd has few possessions except a set of novels of Dickens he cannot read himself, but he once had a companion who read Dickens. aloud to him. So he takes Mr. Todd captive to perform a service for him and, as Mr. Todd is quite incapable of traveling alone through the thick of the woods, he is there for the rest of his days. The early part of the book is a preparation in the Waughish manner for his final appearance. In it we have Mr. Tomlinson playing the squire on his estate, Harton Abbey. The company is as sharp as the set known to or imagined by Mr. Waugh, and the distinctive feature of his style lies in the smooth detachment with which he chronicles the doings of his various parasites and their sufferings. The Curator's Wife. By E. H. Young. Ca. 7s. 6d. This continuation of the story of Dahlia and Jennie Rennell, begun in Jennie & E., will give perfect satisfaction to all Miss Young's readers, old and new. The relations between the sisters have been reversed, and Jennie is now our chief interest. Her marriage to Cecil Sproat, the curate, is going to be a complete success, but the steps toward success are slow and sometimes painful. Miss Young explains them all at length with all her usual wit and dry humbug. The beauty of the drawing of these two young people is beyond praise. As a foil to them we have the vicar and his wife. Miss Doubleday has made the great mistake of sultryly idolizing the son who must naturally turn from her someday, and despising her. must be her final refuge. Her natural dislike of youth and charm makes her far from kind to Dahlia, whose parrying of her rudeness is delightful comic relief. Meanwhile, Cecil is hurt by Diana's pleasure in philandering around the house and rather jealous of Jenny. How by her humour, her affection, and her young steadfastness regains her confidence, and how Cecil fights against his less kind thoughts and regains his love, only Miss Young can tell, without emotion, yet with strong feelings. A PORTRAIT OF HER EXCELLENCE. By Thomas McKENNA. Hutchinson. 7s. 6d. Mr. McKenna's new novel is a commentary on the difference between public and private experience. He takes the case of Richard Croyle, and by way of presenting the account of him accepted by the world at large, gives as a heading to each of his 12 chapters an extract from a fantastic book of reference, Voltaire, 3rd Viscount .. . Educated at Eton and Magdalen, married, in 1908, to Francesca . .. and so on through the list of his services and achievements to his appointment as Governor-General of Australia. The original biography, published after Sir Thomas Adès's death, was based on such material as this, and added nothing of first importance about the man himself. Mr. McKenna, in the person of Lady Diana, now proceeds to tell the inner history of his friend Dick Croyle. It is not by any means a scandalous story. had been known to the public, it would not have made much difference to Lady Astor's career, but no detail of it could have been inferred from any work of reference or from the official biography.

here show inernal over external activity to a degree greater than all but the most dedicatedly doom-laden followers of fiction seem likely to approve of. Between his 48th and his 50th birthdays Ben Curtis has lost a student son, a lifelong friend, a great deal of weight and, it appears, all reasonable hope of emotional equilibnum, never mind earthly happiness, now that his wife Cathy has gone off to live alone with gnef.
Once again, suicide stands at the apex of different kinds of death and mourning. Again, there is no note; no known reason. Ben, who used to like fishing, goes fishing again. Fishermen, read on. One man and his rod, with patience, land a weighty novel safely.
Rose Tremain's fourth novel is glum reading if you are trying to lose weighL It is a catalogue of delicious food: cartloads of calones crowded on tables in the little village of Pomerac, in the Dordogne, and its bigger, superficially more sophisticated sister under the skin of North Oxford. Mutually reflecting examples oferoticism shift back and forth across the Channel ""like those David Cockney painting, this loops of brightiess and all the lying people in their skin repeated. I can imagine very good. No?""
Sadly, no; not even with a French accent. The summer sunshine seems synthetic; there is more dolour than Douceur de la vie in Miss Tremain's knowing ironies and sparklingly self-concious sentences, stylish as they are. A large cast - led by Larry and Miriam Kendall, the one planning his swimming pool against the implacable resistance of bossy Mme de la Brosse, the other recalled to a dying mother's arrogant glamour in Oxford - breaks the novel into less than the sum of its parts.

No memory, no conversation. no past or present knowledge of David Anderson, husband of Helena. no relation to Paul. a respected friend and local GP. unable to explain why the man went missing, or even why he died by his own hand. The post-mortem report was at once conclusive and insuperable. Like death itself, it is tough. Bel Mooney deserves as many readers as possible. Her second novel is a gorgeous, uncritically tidy read. But he holds a mirror up to our own death and the unknown beyond the grave, compounding it with an uncomfortably familiar experience of living-and-loving death outside the confines of the body and a lingering insuficiency of human love. and the reality of human loneliness. These mighty themes - the apocalypse of abstract beauty - shrink into oblivion when the death of a loved one occurs. Only old Conrad Hartley, a great deal older than David, seems to understand it a bit. Alone with his books and the dreadful turn of his genealogical research, his loneliness overlaid with the squalor of his beloved wife's death twenty years earlier, Conrad has observed that most of us tend to resemble strangers even to those closest to us, suggesting, gently, that David's only real relationship was with David. Miss Mooney has done a lot of thinking. Men and women isolated in confusion, innocence, or desperation fill the pages of this novel, a relatively undemanding everyday mystery of middleclass life, their everyday perceptions of death and its consequences. A long hand of coincidence casts doubt on all our lives. and the horror of its consequences. more literary style than Ben Mooney's agreeably plain prose, though less readable, though more powerful and moving, for an overly familiar acquaintance with grief. Now in the courtroom of his own mind, the advocate of death is held in high repute. Americans shackled to this sort of thing do not travel in perfect comfort to this country. William Haines is an admirable, successful novelist, but the complex meditations on the death of Belmore by Ben Mooney and the subsequent voyages of Willie Hopper by Aldous Huxley are both powerful and moving. Above the level of a railway guide, The Swimming Pool by Rosalind Russell is readable in its entirety. XXVII. There is an internal struggle between internal and external activity that is greater than all but the most devotedly doomed followers of fiction seem likely to appreciate. Between his 48th and 50th birthdays, Ben Turnbull has lost a son, a long-term friend, a great deal of weight and, it appears, has lost all reasonable hope of emotional equilibrium, even though his wife has gone off to live alone with his grandson. Once again, suicide is at the apex of different kinds of death and mourning. Again, there is no known reason. Ben, who used to like fishing, goes fishing again. Fisherman, read on. One man and his boat, with enough patience, can bring a heavy novel safely. Rosalind's fourth novel is a gloomy read if you are trying to lose weight. It is a catalogue of delicious food and characters tossed about in the little village of Pomegranate, in the Dordogne, and more sophisticated sister in the south of England. Mutually exclusive examples of metaphysics shift back and forth across the Channel like fluttering eyelids and the glinting corpses of dead people in their sleep. I can imagine very good. No? Sadly, not even with a French accent. The summer sunshine seems more synthetic than the colour of Dolores de la Bouche, the woman recalled to a dying mother's rabid fan club in Oxford. A large cast - led by Larry and Miriam Kendall, the one planning his swimming pool against the impotent resistance of Miss de la Bossa, the other recalling a dead mother in her bed - breaks the novel into less than the sum of its parts.

UNROMANTIC SEAMEN
,Mr. William McFee's WATCH BELOWV (Faber and Faber, 9s. 6d.) is a book with character. It denies the romantic legend that life at sea is nothing but storms and misadventure, and it settles down very sensibly to show us seamen, and particularly the engineers, at their ordinary work. The story is essentially only an illustration to a sort of lively monograph, but the monograph has the interest of most documentary writing and is, in fact, absorbing. Here, we may believe, are a true picture of conditions in a British tramp steamer -before the last war and a just study of the minds of those aboazd her. Some of the hardships, necessary or unnecessary, handed down from the days of sail had already been remitted, but there was no break in the tradition of pride in one's work. Engineers grumbled at antiquated and uneconomical machinery but were secretly proud of what they could get out of it, and masters not yet within the reach of wireless instructions enjoyed a very real responsibility. None of them were men who could have been happy ashore, where they would have had more pay and shorter hours, and their romantic notions of life ashore resemble those that many landsmen have of life at sca. Mr. McFee looks at them dispassionately and with humour and finds them good.
In RESPECTABLE PERSONS (Hutchinson, 7s. 6d.) tMr. Arthur Caddick is similarly unromantic about the British ashore. A young man from the Continent comes to England in order to study a nation he has always admired, and he unfortunately elects to stay with a family named Robinson in a small provincial town. Everywhere he finds hypocrisy, sometimes harmless and amusing, sometimes not, and it must be said that Mr. Caddick manages to substantiate this old charge fairly and with good temper. The Robinsons are necessarily conventionalized, but they represent a complacency and an ignorance that are only now beginning to disappear, and Mr. Caddick is merely doing for us what wc have frequently done for other brecds. And he has the grace to return his visitor to an even more irresponsible .home.
ENVOY ON EXCURSIoN, by Caryl Brahms and S. J. Simon (Michael Joseph, 8s.), is sometimes much more trcnchant. It is a lunatic comedy of Whitehall in wartimc, a neutral kingdom with products desired by both Great Britain and Germany, and Adam Quill, the detective who discovered who shot the bullet in the ballet. Stroganoff's Russian ballet comes in again for a gala performance in the Capital of Insomnia, but the present lunacy is concerned more particularly with politics, with drugged coffee and hopelessly inefficient and venial spies, and with the rise of the Nazi party in Insomnia-up-to the age of 15-and Herrvon Papcn's tendency to miss the train. The brew is kept bubbling with mischief, with malice, and with an invention that seldom hesitates.
We may end with a glance at the short stories by Mr. Fred Urquhart collected in I FELL FOR A SAILOR (Duckworth, 7s. 6d.).. Mr. Urquhart has a good range and can handle the satirical, the pathetic, -and the comic with some talent. His best work is, in fact, comic, for in ""Being a Bohemian,"" for instance, he draws his character -and makes his comment impersonally, without the sometimes embarrassing sympathy that is shown in one or two of the pathetic pieces. Even in these there is no complete failure. J.

Stanislavsky's Russian ballet comes to life again for a gala performance in the capital of Russia, but the present lunacy is particularly concerned with politics, with drugged coffee and hopelessly inefficient and vexatious spies, and with the rise of the Nazi party in Germany - up to the age of 15 - and with Peter Paul's tendency to miss the train.

With his aviator glasses, his lurid imagination and his chronic inability to frame a decent sentence, Marenghi is a dead ringer for Hutson. Haunted by the terrible fear that the literary critics will never take him seriously, the great man unveils some of the. secrets of his craft in a playlet that zig-zags along with the help of some glorious coarse acting. Lugubrious to the last, Marenghi introduces us to the tortured Neil Hack, a horror writer struggling with his inner demons and a bad case of writer's block.
You could say that it is easy to parody the prose style of schlock horror fiction, but the extracts from the Marenghi - Hack oeuvre capture the preposterousness of it all without sinking into too much gore and guts.

After a troubled opening, Mac and his colleagues Catherine Tate and Daniel Antopolski worked up an old-fashioned vaudeville head of steam. The Blair Witch parody already seems outdated and I never thought I would see an Irish jockey turned into a figure of fun in this day and age. Mack, a tiny bit of nervous energy, somehow carries it off.",,
Null,New Novels,The Times,1931-Jan-20,"London, England","II : NEW NOVELS
Among new novels are FROM DAY TO DAY, by Ferdynand Goetel, translated ! from the Polish by Winifred Cooper
(Elkin M*Iathews, 7s. 6d.: net-); and STORIES WrrHOuT WoNiES; by Donn Byrne (Sampson Low, 7s. 6d. net).
"" From Day to Day,"" the first specimen in English of the work of the Polish writer Ferdynand Gooetel, is introduced by Mr. Johin Galsworthy, whose explanatory note on the unusual method and construction of this novel should save the reader fiom a good deal of unnecessary bewilderment. MIr. Goetel gives us a novel and a diary, or rather alternating fragment-s of a novel and a diary, which are distinguished by being printed respectively in italics and Roman letters. The novel treats of the experiences of a Polish prisoner of var, who had fought wiith the Austrian armny and, having been captired bv the Russians, had been interned in Turkcstafi, where there happened to be a small colony of expatriated Poles. The prisoner in question is, or was, no other than the novelist himself- his novel, that is to say, is almost pure autobiographvy, in which he and tbe friend who was captured witlh him are disguised only by name, and in which the details of a love affair witl a Polish girl named Marttsia are reproduced withl tender fidelity. The diary is at once a comm,entary on the novel wmhih the novelist-diarist is writing and a record of domestic events years after the experiences recounted in the novel. Stanislaw, jlie Writer, is now living in Cracow, hardly on the best ef terms with his wife Zosia, simzilarly alienated from his former fellowprisoner, pursued by an emotional married woman wlho writes poetiy, and still obsessed by thoughts of the Polish girl in Turkestan. The cunning and I dexteritv with which the - two themes! are blended are much to be admired, and the final solution,in the pagesof the diary., of the problem posed, in the unfinished novel (vhich the author, wisely enough inD tho circumstances, throws up in despair). goes a long way towards justifying the element of eccentricity in the author's method. His story is not so striking dS his way of telling it ; but t-he performance. as a whole, is stimulating and well worth attention.
Readers of Lever will remember that Con Cregan, when invited to ivrite an account of French naval achievem-nents in Chinlese waters in the reign of King Louis Philippe, drew ample inspiration for an informiative and convincing article on the subject for his friend Paul de Min6rale's newvspaper from the contemplation of a willow-pattern plate. M;lr. Byrne, in these STORIES WITHOUT WOMEN, seems to have emulated his famous but fictional compatriot ; but, owing to the lapse of a century, the result is not quite as convincing or satisfactory. He tells a baker's dozen of stories (most. of vhich have women in
them), effective in themselves. sometimes' grave to the point of gloominess, sometimes gay. But nearly every one contains some irritating flawv, if not in the jewel, at
least in its setting. The author is not I happy in dressing his Orientals, or inl describing places vhich hc does not seem to have seen: ho is careless in some of his details and liiakes odd errors at times reminiscent of the magnificent disregard for time, space, and convention in dealing wvitlh foreign scenes and customs vhich used to characterize some of the earlier Aniciean cinematograph films.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS285680692/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=ce1c2536,"II NEW ENGLISH BOOKS Among the new novels are From Paris to London, by Rudolph Goethe, translated from the Polish by Wilfrid Rall, &c. 7 &mdash; and STORIES FROM WHICH WOMEN ARE WRITTEN, by Donner and Rother Meier, &nbsp; 7 &gt; 8. From Day to Day, the first English specimen of the work of the Polish writer Rudolph Goolet, is introduced by Mr. Johon Galsworthy, whose explanation of the unusual method and construction of this novel should save the reader from a good deal of unnecessary bewilderment. Mr. Goethe gives us a novel and a diary, or rather, alternating fragments of a novels and a diaries, which are distinguished by being printed in italics and Roman letters. The novel consists of the experiences of a Polish prisoner of war, who had fought with the Austrian army and, having been captured by the Russians, had been interned in the Turkish city of Turkishstan, where there happened to be a small colony of expatriated Poles. The prisoner in question is, or was, no other than the novelist himself- his novel, that is to say, is almost pure autobiography, in which he and the friend who was captured with him are only disguised by name, and in which the details of a love affair with a Polish girl named Maria are reproduced with tenderness and fidelity. The diary is at once a chronicle of the novel which the novelist-diarist is writing and a record of the domestic events which follow after the experiences described in the novel. Stanislaw, like the Writer, is now living in Prague, hardly on the best terms with his wife, Zoe, who is similar to his former companion, and is pursuing an emotional wife who writes poetry, and is still obsessed by the thoughts of the Polish girl in Turkestan. The wit and the dexterity with which he writes with which the two themes are mixed are to be admired, and the final solution, in the pages of the diary, of the problem posed, in the unfinished novel which the author, in wise deeds in the circumstances, throws up in despair. It goes a long way toward justifying the eccentricity of the author's method. His story is not so striking as its telling, but the performance. As a whole, it is stimulating and well worth attention. Readers of Lady Lovelace will remember that Conway, when asked to write an account of French naval successes in Chinese waters during the reign of Louis XIV, drew ample inspiration for an informative and convincing article on the subject for his friend, Paul Revere, in the New England newspaper from the contemplation of a wall-paper pattern. Mr. Byrne, in these STORIES ABOUT WOMEN, seems to have emulated his famous but fictional counterpart, but owing to the lapse of time, the result is not quite as convincing or satisfactory. He tells a tale of three women, all of whom have some effect in him, and most of whom are not. sometimes to the point of gloominess, sometimes to death. But almost every book contains some annoying flaw, whether intentional or not, in the writing or in the setting. The author is not happy in dressing up his characters, or in describing places which he does not seem to have seen, or in making some of his details seem odd or reminiscent of the immense disregard for time, space, etc. dealing with the various scenes and customs which used to characterize the early American cinema.",,

"Johnson, Daniel",Passion for the facts,The Times,1994-Nov-26,"London, England","Passion for the facts
Daniel Johnson surveys the most voluminous Christmas presents of all
Keats apostrophised ""manna and dates, in argosy transferred from Fez"", but some of us are no less addicted to the other kind of dates. If, as Bacon said, histor - ies make men wise, then chro - nology is the skeleton key to history, the aide memoire with - out which the past is a tale told by an ideologist. ' Odd, then, that one has had to scour second-hand book - shops to find the 20-year-old Chronology of World History. Now it has at last been repub - lished by Helicon in four vol - umes at £160 the set or £40 a volume. The Modern World: 1763-1992 has been updated, while its companions on the ancient, medieval and "" expand - ing "" worlds have lost none of their relevance. An invaluable repository of time past. History needs its temporal dimension , but it is no less meaningless without geogra - phy , and no library is complete without a good historical atlas. The Times Atlas of European History is cheap at £25. Pro - duced to the high standards one
expects from Times Books, it traces continental history as far as the Urals over three millen - nia , with enough text to orien - tate the reader without crowding the maps. The Dorling Kindersley World Reference Atlas costs more at £29.95 and cannot com - pete with the Times Atlases for the beauty of its maps. But it is a handy book for students of geo - graphy or international relat - ions , or for anybody who needs to know about a country at a glance. Each entry offers a col - ourful summary of the essential facts about the country in question. World History {Robert Hale £24.99) is ""a dictionary of im - portant , people, places, and events, from ancient times to the present"" . Edited by Bruce Wetterau, this slab of over a thousand pages compresses an entire chronology of each major nation into its entry. This cheap compendium will satisfy most gluttons for facts without hog - ging your bookshelves.
For longer mini-profiles , turn to the Cambridge Biographical Encyclo - pedia (Cambridge £29.95). Edited by David Crystal, this is an impressive work of enduring value; but I found it generally less informative than Magnus Magnussqn's older Chambers Biographical Dictionary (£35 hbk, also available in paper - back at only £17.99). More specialised but also more authoritative is the Hutchinson Dictionary of Sci - entific Biography (Helicon £50). Originally published in six volumes a decade ago, this one-volume edition has been edited by the redoubtable Roy Porter. The entries are scholarly and up to date, though the living scientists inevitably lead less colourful lives than the
boffins of earlier centuries. This is too expensive a work for most laymen, but secondary school libraries should have a copy. A Dictionary of Military History (Blackwell £35) is a French work edited by Andre Corvisier. It is admirably com - prehensive and offers useful bibliographies after each arti - cle . Though it has been revised for this English edition, there is an occasional hint of bias which may irritate some readers. I do not know whether John Childs, the Dictionary's British editor, examined the entry on Waterloo very careful - ly , but it certainly reads oddly: J The tactical errors of Napo - leon , who no longer had the vigour of youth, and the lack of initiative of his subordinates, in conjunction with the numerical inferiority of the French forces, explain this defeat which, so on - er or later, was inevitable."" In other words: the Emperor (actu - ally only 45 at the time) and his marshals lost the battle; Wel-I
lington and Bliicher did not win it. That is nonsense. As for the inevitability of Napoleon's de - feat : he was outnumbered over - all , but not during the decisive engagement with Wellington and the disparity was some - what less than that between the French and the Allies at Auster - Iitz , say, when Bonaparte won. The Oxford Children's Book of Famous People is the flag - ship of a new series of children's reference books from OUP. At £20 for fewer than 400 pages, it is not very good value, though other titles are cheaper. How - ever , what bothered me most about this work was its cavalier treatment of the facts.
Take the entry on Adolf Hitler, a tricky subject for any teacher or parent. Hitler's early career gets too much space, yet the summary of his ideas does not even mention race. The story of Hitler's appointment as chancellor is badly garbled, while the claim that ""millions of people were sent to concentra - tion camps"" after 1933 is false: before 1939, the num - bers were in the thousands. No mention is made of appease - ment , and Hitler's wartime role is absurdly truncated. Other entries reveal similar flaws. Children deserve the same high standards that OUP normally maintain ,in their Continued on page XI
<NEWPAGE>
Reference books, continued from page VIII books for adults, and I cannot recommend it. Larousse, which dominates the French reference market, has come up with two cribs for literary pedants, both bargains at £25, useful for settling domes - tic disputes. The Dictionary of Writers is the most up-to-date work of its kind, and more international than the older Collins Biographical Dictio -
nary of English Literature, also £25. More fun is the Dictionary of Literary Characters. It will tell you whether it was Byron's Manfred who killed his daugh - ter by mistake, or whether Horace Walpole's Manfred in The Castle. of Otranto commit - ted incest with his sister. (It was the other way round.) Meeting the dramatis personae might persuade youngsters to read the works in which they appear; the same goes for adults, none of
whom will have read all the recent novels in this volume.

Daniel Johnson surveys the most vociferous Christmas present of all, the apocalyptic manna and dates, invariably transferred from France, but some of us are no less addicted to the other kind of dates. If, as Bacon said, ""stories make men wiser,"" then history is the key to his understanding, the only way to know whether the past is a tale told by an idealist. It is odd, then, that one has to search second-hand book-shops to find the 20-year-old History of World History. Now it has been republished by Henry Conway in four volume-sets at the cost of £20 or more per volume. The Modern World 1763-1922 has been updated, while its companions on the ancient, medieval and advancing worlds have lost none of their significance. An indispensable repository of past time. History needs its temporal dimension, but it is no less meaningless without geo-graphy, and no library is complete without a good historical atlas. The Times Atlas of European History is cheap at 25. Produced to the high standards one expects from The Times Books, it traces continental history as far as the Romans and beyond, with enough text to encourage the reader without crowding the pages. The Dorling Kindersley World Reference Atlas costs more at 29.95 and cannot compete with the Times Atlases for the beauty of its maps. But it is a handy book for students of geo-graphy or international relations, or for anybody who needs to know about a country at a glance. Each entry offers a colourful summary of the essential facts about the country in question. dictionary of important people, places, and events, from ancient times to the present. Edited by Bruce Wetterau, this slab of over a thousand pages compresses an entire chronology of each major nation into its entry. This cheap compendium will satisfy most gluttons for facts without hogging your bookshelves. For longer mini-profiles, turn to the Cambridge Biography of Cambridge 29.95. By David Crystal, this is an impressive work of enduring value but I found it generally less informative than the much older Magnus Magnusson's Biography of Charles Babbage, also available in paperback at only 17.99. More specialised but also more authoritative is the Hutchinson Dictionary of Scientific Biography 50. Originally published in six volumes a decade ago, this one-volume edition has been edited by the reputedly brilliant Roy Porter. The entries are scholarly and up-to-date, though the living scientists inevitably lead less colourful lives than the boys of earlier centuries. This is too expensive for most laymen, but secondary school libraries should have a copy. A Dictionary of Military History by Blackwell 35 is a French work edited by Andres Corvisier. It is admirably comprehensive and offers useful bibliographies after each article. Though it has been revised for this English edition, there is an occasional hint of bias which may irritate some readers. I do not know whether John Church, the British Dictionary's editor, is aware of this. Waterloo very carefully, but it certainly reads oddly. The tactical errors of Napoleon, who no longer had the vigour of his youth, and the lack of initiative of his subordinates, in conjunction with the numerical inferiority of the French forces, explain this defeat, which was soon or later, inevitable. In other words, the Emperor was actually only 45 at the time and his ministers lost the battle at Wel-Ilington and Bismarck did not win it. That is nonsense. As for the inevitable inevitability of Napoleon's death, he was outnumbered over-all, but not during the decisive engagement with Wellington and the disparity was somewhat less than that between the French and the Allies at Austerlitz, say, when Bonaparte won. The Oxford Children's Books of Famous People is the first in a new series of children's reference books from OUP. At 20 pages for less than 400 pages, it is not very good value, though other titles are cheaper. However, what bothers me most about this work is its clunky treatment of the facts. Take the entry on Adolf Hitler, a tricky subject for any teacher or parent. His early career gets too much space, and the summary of his ideas does not even mention race. The story of Hitler's appointment as chancellor is badly written, while the claim that millions of people were killed is unfounded. to concentration camps after 1933 is false, and before 1939, the numbers were in the thousands. No mention is made of appeasement, and Hitler's wartime role is absurdly truncated. Other entries reveal similar flaws. Children deserve the same high standards that adults do, and their continued use of the reference books is useful for settling domestic disputes. The Dictionary of Writers is the most up-to-date work of its kind, and more international than the older, more expensive American Dictionary of English Literature, also 25. More fun is the Dictionary of Literary Characters. It will tell you whether it was Byron who killed his daughter by mistake, or whether Horace Walpoles killed his sister in The Castle. Orson Welles committed adultery with his sister. It was the other way round. The drama of the protagonist might persuade youngsters to read the works in which they appear the same goes for adults, none of whom will have read all the recent novels in this volume. The Cambridge English Dictionary, now available in a completely revised second edition, is an excellent one-volume encyclopedia, remarkably cheap at $29.95. It is less erudite than the more expensive Columbia English Dictionary, the current fifth edition. 65. The Cambridge edition undercuts its rival, the Hutchinson Encyclopedia 1995 edition, by 35. The Cambridge also offers more entries on more subjects and is more serious in tone. But the Gaudily illustrated Hutton is more reader-friendly. For school children and computer buffs, Hutchinsons also publishes the only British CD-ROM encyclopaedia, the Hutton Multimedia Encyclopedia 1995, at 60. This is doubtlessly the shape of the encyclopedics to come, but the price should fall when the CD-ROM market becomes more competitive.",,

Mr. Armstiong has chosen as subject for his third novel the early developmlent of a boy witlh a imarked musical gift. Adlian Glynde, the grandson of Olivor Glyndeothe poet, lhad his natural tendencies to shyniess and introversion exaggerated by an unhlappy childlhood. His father was killed in the Great War when Adrian wvas seven, and his imother was ono of those vtainl, shallow womien 'who treat. |motlherlhood as an intermittent personal aiiiusciieitit. Tlhesingle happyconisequence of her selfislness was that tho boy saw her 'very rarely in his holidays, even before she married again and went to live in India; and was able to find something of the symlpatlhy and understanding he craved in the company of an uncle, an aunit, and nmore particularly his grandfather. When he wenit to a public school, Adrian developed an intense admiratiorl for Ronald Dakyn, lhis fag-nmaster and his psychlological complement, a boy who -was in fact, although Mr. Armstrong is careful to avoid any psycho-analytical phraseology, a typical extrovert. This was an adoration that could lead only to disillusionument, and it is witlh this that the story ends, about a year after Adrian has run away from school. This is a theme for a poet, and as suclh Mr. Arnmstrong has Coloured it with some beautiful passages in his owvn delicate and distinguislhed prose. T'he characters are all well seen, and two at least, those of Adriani and his grandfathler, deeply understood.
CHIERRY GA311OL AND OTHER STORIES,
by Mr. E:den Phillpotts, is a pleasant collection of tales in the author's wellknown Devonshire style and written in his Devonian idiom. Though none of them is epoch-making, and sozin of them are rathler obviously manufactured, they nre all characterized by the humour and hunanity wvhich delight this author's readers. The story of howv Bill Parker, Farmer Jordan's horseman, won his bride by handing his legacy over to Job Blades, or that which relates howv grandfather Jngo came to life again vhile being moved from one parish to another in his owlI house, or that again which shows Drake Causley vinning Mlilly Putt by manly steadfastness after she had jilted him, will no doubt eaclh find their supporters.

Mr. Armstrong has chosen as his subject for his third novel the early development of a boy with a marked musical gift. Alasdair Glynde, the grandson of Othello and the other poets, has had his natural tendency to squall and belittling, and his mother was one of those vain, selfish women who treated motherhood as an intermittent personal crisis. The single happy consequence of her self-sacrifice was that the boy saw her very seldom in his holidays, even before she married again and went to live in India and was able to find something of the simplicity and understanding that he craved in the company of an uncle, a friend, and especially his grandfather. When he went to a public school, Adrian developed an intense admiration for Ronald Daniel, his father-in-law and his psychoanalytical counterpart, a boy who was, in fact, although Mr. Armstrong is careful not to use any psychoanatomical phraseology, a typical extrovert. This was an admiration that could only lead to disillusionment, and it is with this that the story ends, about a year after Adrian has run away from school. This is a theme for a poet, and Mr. Armstrong has filled it with some beautiful passages in his own distinguished and distinguished prose.

Worldly wisdom abounds in the doings and sayings of Mr. Phillips's country folk, and never more so than when Miss Fern, in the story which gives the book its name, remarks that ""Most women know what a terrible lot to do with hysteria and contempt for a working man's food, and that the wives can live on the smell of a boiled dish-crust and care little to eat unless they are hungry, and never grasp the grasp of what food is to their husbands."" Mr. Louis Marlow's new novel deserves a special place in history because it leads to a new adventure in publishing which may moderately revolutionize the sale of fiction.

T his is a startlingly good biography. On the face of it Daphne du Maurier, like many dedicated writ - ers , did not have an eventful life. She married an army officer, had three children, wrote best-selling novels — several of which have become classics — lived in Cornwall, and in later life was something of a recluse. She died in 1989. Margaret Forster's good luck is that Daphne's friends and family kept her letters, sometimes at Daphne's own request, for she intended to leave her testimony, and believed biography should tell the truth even though it might be ""often hard for the family to take"" . Daphne du Maurier's good luck is to have Margaret Forster as a biographer. There is piquancy in her having been educated at the same school—the County High School in Carlisle — as Tod, Daphne's governess. Tod was Daphne's confidante for years, and remained in - volved with the family until after Daph - ne 's own children had grown up. Forster shares something of that same sympath etic discretion and northern shrewdness. Daphne's father was the actor Gerald du Maurier, a world-class charmer who
two-timed his wife and loved his daugh - ters jealously and too much. He had longed for a son, and Daphne as a child not only wanted to be a boy but believed she really was one. Later she was attracted to both women and men; her early physical relationships were with a French schoolmistress and Carol Reed, the future film director. More important than either was being alone in the family's holiday house in Cornwall, and beginning to write. Her early stories were ""fuelled by disgust"" at the way men treated women. Daphne was extremely pretty in the English way, and her marriage to athletic good-looking Major Frederick Browning, known as Tommy, or Boy, seemed made in heaven. It was she who proposed and she, as her novels sold in their hundreds of thousands, who maintained their style of life, such as it was. The nurturing, maternal, home-making side of Daphne was non-existent . The house was icy, the food primitive. She loved her children, especially her son, but was a distant mother to the girls when they were little. Her elder daughter's nanny never had a single evening off for the first six months —- and when she was finally given one,
DAPHNE DU MAURIER By Margaret Forster Chatto8Windus,£17 .99
caring for the baby for a few hours reduced its parents to nervous prostration When a housemaid came to be inter - viewed , she thought the nanny was Mrs Browning, and that Mrs Browning was a visitor, she seemed so detached. Yet Daphne's whole life was centred on her home which was, for 25 years, Menabilly — the Manderley of Rebecca. The second world war showed up the cracks in the marriage. Tommy had a brave and distinguished war career, ending up as Mountbatten's right-hand man, and was knighted in 1946. In spite of a wartime liaison of her own, she had longed for his return. Somehow they could not pick up the pieces. He was inhibited and exhausted, and she was depressed by the anti-climax . A couple of years later Daphne, aged forty, was infatuated, like a romantic boy, with Ellen Doubleday the wife of her American publisher. Tommy, mean -
while , became Comptroller to the house - hold of HRH Princess Elizabeth and had to be in London. Daphne then fell in love less chastely with Gertrude Lawrence, one of her father's last mistresses, who was playing the lead in Daphne's play September Tide, which was really about Ellen Doubleday. All rather complicated. Tommy drank too much, sailed his boat at weekends and found his own consolat - ions in female form. He and Daphne were often unhappy, both sometimes on the verge of mental breakdown. They still loved one another in a deep, hopeless way and kept up a united front for outsiders and on occasions such as visits to Balmoral. People still saw Sir Frederick and Lady Browning as the ideal couple. Daphne hated ""the L-word"" — lesbian — and thought of herself as a "" half - breed "", and as having a No 1 self, which the world saw, and a No 2 self, who was a ""boy-in-a-box"" and the one who did the writing. Her tragedy was that the "" boy - in - the - box "" faded after Gertrude's death and as Daphne grew older; without him it was harder to find the impetus for fiction. Her work grew more macabre. After Tommy's death her widowhood seems sad.
Daphne du Mauner was articulate in her private letters about her dual self and about the specific relationships or crises which she ""purged"" in her fictions. Rebecca, for example, was sparked off by her jealousy of her husband's former fiancee. The works stand on their own and need no subtexts. But there always was one, and those who protest against biographers reading the life into the work and the work through the life are, in this case at least, knocked clean out of court. Because Daphne wrote so eloquently about herself, virtually all Forster has to do in order to reveal the complexities is to quote, though she makes an excursion into hypothesis about the sexual death of the marriage. I thought, at first, that Forster's authorial reticence was excessive. She does not address the' question of whether Daphne was interfered with by her crazily possessive and very hands-on father, though every reader must wonder. She glides over Daphne's physical affair with Gertrude in such a way that it would be possible to miss it. But afterwards these matters resonate in.the mind with an ambiguity that may well reflect the reality. It is all extremely well-judged .

She married an army officer, had three children, wrote best-selling novels of which several have become classics, and in later life was something of a relic. She died in 1989. Margaret Forster's good luck is that her friends and family kept her letters, sometimes at Daphne's own request, for she intended to leave her testimony, and she believed that a biography should tell the truth even though it might be hard for the family to accept it. Diana's good fortune is to have Margaret Forster as a biographer. There is something peculiar about having been educated at the same school as Tom, the family's governess. Tom was a confidante for years, and remained in-volved with the family until after Diana's own children had grown up. Forster shares something of that sympathetic and northern shrewdness. Her father was the famous Gerald du Maurier, a world-class charmer who twice divorced his wife and loved his daughters jealously and too much. He had longed for a son, and as a child, she wanted not only a son but also a daughter. Later she was attracted to both women and men; her early physical relationships were with a French school mistress and a French film director. More important than either was being alone in the family house in Cornwall, and beginning to write. Her early stories were fuelled by a disgust at the way men treated women. Daphne was extremely pretty in the English way, and her marriage to Tom was unhappy. marriage to athletic-looking Major Frederick Browning, known as Tommy, or Boo, seemed made in heaven. It was she who proposed, and she, as her novels were sold in the thousands, maintained their style of life, such as it was. The nurturing, maternal, home-making side of Diana was non-existent. The house was cold, the food was primitive. She loved her children, especially her son, but was a distant mother to the girls when they were little. Her older daughter never had a single evening off for the first six months - and when she was finally given one, DAPHNE DU MAURIEUR By Margaret Forster, 8 vols. 1.99 Caring for a baby for a few hours reduced its parents to nervous prostration when a housemaid came to be viewed, she thought the nanny was Miss Browning, and that Miss Browning was a visitor, she seemed so detached. Yet her whole life was centred on her home, which was, for 25 years, essentially the Manderley family home. The Second World War showed up the cracks in the marriage. Tommy had a brave and distinguished war career, ending up as Mountbatten's right-hand man, and was knighted in 1946. In spite of a wartime liaison of her own, she had longed for her return. Somehow they could not pick up the pieces. He was timid and exhausting, and she was depressed by the prospect of death. A couple of years later, Daphne, aged forty, was infatuated, like a Roman cat, with Miss Ellen. her American publisher. Tommy, who was mean-spirited, became a house-wife to the house-hold of Prince Phillip and had to be in London. Daphne then fell in love less chastely with Gloria Lawrence, one of her father's last mistresses, who was playing the lead in Daphne's play, Scenes in Time, which was really about Ellen Doubleday. All rather complicated. Tommy drank too much, sailed his boat at weekends and found his own solutions in female form. He and Daphne were often unhappy, both on the verge of mental breakdown. They still loved one another in a deep, hopeless way and kept up a united front for outsiders and occasional visitors to Balmoral. People still see Sir Frederick and Lady Babbage as the ideal couple. Diana hated the word ""lesbian"" and thought of herself as a half-breed, and as having a No 1 self, which the world saw, and a No 2 self, which was a boy-in-a-box and the one who did the writing. Her tragedy was that the 'whole-brain' self faded after her death and as Daphne grew older without him it was harder to find the impetus for fiction. Her work became more and more maudlin. After Tommy's death, her widowhood seemed sad. Diana du Maurier was acute in her private letters about her dual self and about the specific relationships or crises which she reflected in her fictions. For example, in Rebecca, the daughter of a former slave who married a rich man. was sparked off by her jealousy of her husband's former fiancee. The works stand on their own and need no subtexts. But there was always one, and those who opposed the biographers who read the life into the work and the life through the work are, in this case, almost knocked out of court. Because Daphne wrote so eloquently about herself, almost all that Forster has to do in order to reveal the complexities is to quote, though she makes an occasional expedition into the abyss of the dead. I thought, at first, that Forster's authorial reticence was excessive. She does not address the question of whether Daphne was interfering with her by being so crass and possessive as her father, though every reader must wonder. She glides over Daphne's physical affair with Gloria in such a way that it would be impossible to miss it. But after all, these matters resonate in the mind with an ambiguity that may well reflect the reality. It is all extremely well-judged. Victoria Glendinning",,

THE ANGLER's ENGLAND. By PATRICK
CHALMERS. Seeley Service. 8s. 6d.
The new volume of the ""English Scene"" series is devoted to fishing in English waters, fresh and salt. And Mr. Patrick Chalmers, looking at the various ""Aspects"" of fishing in England, notes that while, in the artistic "" Aspect,"" John Leech has given us both a classic fishing figure in Mr. Briggs, and a classic hunting one in Jorrocks, there are many classic hunting novels on the bookshelf, but no classic fishing novel.

From the "" Book of St. Albans,"" which includes both but extols fishing, through Izaak Walton. down to Charles Kingsley, Froude, Andrew Lang, Lord Grey of Fallodon, and even- later, much has been written on the sport of angling which can properly be classed as good literature; and Mr. Chalmers, himself a fishing writer of authority and repute, gives us a short list of his favourites.
Every fisherman makes his own list- to which this book, wiihout doubt, will be added. For Mr. Chalmers not only, writes with all the zest of an enthusiast, he gives us also many good stories, much research to prove Shakespeare's knowledge of angling, and much verse of others, and of his own-his sporting songs are famousboth new and old. He writes with special knowledge of Thames fishing, both for trout and for ""coarse"" fish which, he rightly says, require an even higher form of art than is necessary for salmon and trout; though, as illustrating the ""English Aspect,"" he chooses, and describes lovingly, a golden day on the Test with the dry-fly. And if for most of his descriptions of sport with salmon and seatrout he goes to Scottish memories and not to Wye or Usk, Dart or Tamar, he can plead that Charles Kingsley, most English of writers, preferred a Highland salmon-river to any other.

TERRORISTS IN MACEDONIA
NIGHT OVER THE EAST. - Translated and
Adapted from the German by EDWIN and WILLA MUIR. Sheed and Ward. 7s. 6d.
There may be good reasons for withholding from the reader any information about the author of this novel, of which the setting is South-Eastern Europe and the principal episodes are concerned with the Macedonian terrorist organization known as Imro; but it would have been helpful to know the precise extent of ""' adaptation "" which the translators have found necessary or desirable. It is an extraordinary piece of wvork, written with furious energy and with uncommon dialectical skill in the Catholic standpoint, entirely melodramatic in style, yet both illuminating and persuasive.
'We arrive -at South-Eastern Europe by way of Finland, where Albert, Baron von Kloibner, a peculiarly vehement Hungarian aristocrat, has retired after the War in order to nurse the most inspissated of glooms. His life among the Lapps of the Murman coast is described vividly enough, but the fun does not begin in earnest until he is back in Budapest, where the brilliantly rhapsodical Tom O'Flanagan awaits him. This is an indomitable adventurer of the new school, who, had smuggled himself into Soviet Russia and outwitted the Cheka, hatched revolutions in South America, sold the plans of Indian fortresses, and so on. His greatest and last love is Macedonia""; his mortal 'foe is Belgrade, with its orthodoxy and Freemasonry and even worse things in the background. Albert, torn between an old aristocratic love and a new aristocratic love-the voluble strain of contempt for the undifferentiated mass is not without its interest-is pressed into the service of Imro, and wanders between Budapest, Sofia, and Vienna-while Tom and the immensely efficient Bulgarian terrorist, Krum Daneff, get down to work. He alone survives, a somewhat transcendental Catholic self-condemned to exile in Lapland.
CREED. By MARGIAD EvANs. Oxford:
Blackwell. 7s. 6d.
""I begin to write, relying on the force and fine senses of each moment,"" announces Miss Evans in a brief preface. ""That will be my strength.
What I offer you as reading is real, though I outstrip each page and at the end am different."" It is her strength, and her offering is real; we may agree, even though the ""difference"" she either fears or, it may be, hopes for, is not very evident. Her characters change, some of them, in their own strange ways, but it is a transformation, inherent from the very first chapter. There 'Francis Dollbright, who walks in the fear of a merciless God, cries out upon one who holds a gentler view; before the end he has himself cast off the burden of his fear in acceptance of that same view, which would seem to be very much the author's also. This progress towards release, which begins with a yet deeper descent towards terror, is the story's main subject; but other persons are grouped about Dollbrighta lodger, a girl, and her lover-who similarly struggle in desperate toils. These characters, drowning in their fears and despairs, -determine the book's somewhat nightmare quality, its intensitv, its strangeness, so marked that the Welshborder town of Chepsford, where all' takes place, itself seems dreamlike, wavering yet more real than any daylight world. The personal nature of Miss Evans's vision leads her up some odd alleys; her power as a writer is undeniable.
THE GREEN LION. By FRANCIS HACKETrT.
Nicholson and Watson. 7s. 6d.
Mr. Francis Hackett is better known in America than in this country, where his highly coloured studies in history have
been subjected to severe criticism. But i this novel of Irish life during Pamnell's last campaign is direct, vigorous and devoid of stylistic trappings. Mr. Hackett is primarily interested in the social, religious, and political factors which have gone to the making of modern Ireland. But he is an e?cellent storyteller and his account of the childhood and schooldays of Jerry Coyne is full of authentic incident and has a freshness of its own. The story mainly takes place in the historic but decayed city of Kilkenny, with its memories of Berkeley, Congreve and Swift.
Jerry lives with his uncle, who 'is the editor of a provincial newspaper,' and his' earliest impressions, therefore, are of the furious political factions of the time and the rising force of. clericalism.' Jerry's progress from convent infant class to Christian Brothers and Jesuit residential college is in itself a summary of the Irish educational system. Mr. Hackett appears to be an uncompromising opponent of celibate education, and his main purpose is to show its deleterious effect on the national character. But he avoids morbidity and makes his young hero a normal healthy boy.
THE ROAD AND THE WOOD. By JOHN
OWEN. Macmillan. 7s. 6d.
So long as Mr. Owen is dealing with the country folk of the Suffolk village where the scene of his novel is laid the pages of' this novel are attractive and convincing. Ephraim Power, the philosophical tramp, with his mongrel dog, and his strange friend Dave Alullins, whose muddled wits are lit by a ray of religious illumination, are well described and their communings in Suffolk dialect admirably rendered. Unfortunately other parts of the novel are less convincing than Dave's institution of solitary worship in his woodland temple. The train of rather melodramatic circumstance whereby a clever doctor has to bring his tortured, remorseful soul to be healed by the simDle rustic loon strikes the reader as an artificial construction which is not improved by the author's rather desperate attempt to interest him il ' the doctor's psychological case. A fatal motor accident begins the train of events, and another one has to end it.

Sir Gilbert Parker has felt himself inspired to retell the stories of Saul and David, Kings of Israel. So far as the narrative in the Books of Samuel and Kings is explicit hc keeps strictly to it, as he keeps to the magnificent phraseology of the Authorized Versidn. His own additions, apart from those of accurate scenic description, are somewhat below the magnificences of the ancient chronicle. There are readers, no doubt, who will appreciate Sir Gilbert's amplification of details, and be grateful to him for his presentations of the female characters, such as Michal, Leah, and above all Bathsheba; but we doubt if their previous ideas of the great heroic characters, Saul, Samuel, David, and Jonathan, will receive any important quickening from this praiseworthy but rather solemn gloss on a story which, in England, is still a household word.
Mr. Frank Swinnerton has written what might be called a mystery story of the emotions. Like the author of a detective novel, Mr. Swinnerton sows his pages with false clues, and it is not until the last few pages of a by no means slhort book that the reader knows who is in love with Catherine and who is in love with Rhoda. Catherine and Rhoda are the two daughters of Ferdinand Meadows, the twin Cordelias of a mild and sensitive Lear. The greater part of the book is taken up with long and tortuous conversations on the possible relationships of the characters. Ferdinand is terrified that Catherine, his elder, quieter, and less emotional daughter, is in love with Jabez Talbot, an earnest North-country Socialist, whose abruptness is a perpetual agony to him, but it is Rhoda, the younger, more volatile girl, about whom he had separate but no less dreadful fears, who eventually marries Jabez.
"" Youth Rides Out "" is the story of an unsuccessful marriage. Lindsay Bordon, who inherited a certain idealistic asceticism and a strong will, from his father, fals in love with the lovely CamiUa Neale, aged 19. Camilla's doting father is a rich manufacturer of biscuits, and has never thwarted her happiness. Camilla gets her penniless lover, whose chosen profession is that of veterinary surgeon in Liverpool; and in getting him she meant to get him wholly. Here she failed. Love, for Camilla, meant amorous dalliance in a life of ease, and she trusted in her power to use passion as the means of weaning Lindsay from a life of poverty and strenuous endeavour and of brioging him into the opulent Neale world. The major part of this novel is a detailed description of the battle between Lindsay Bordon's will and the Neale family. It is cleveirly done with a wealth of detail of the domestic kind.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS302980903/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=195651e2,"New novels.

There are readers, no doubt, who will appreciate Sir Gilbert's amplification of details, and will be grateful to him for his representations of the female characters, such as Mary, Leah, and above all, Babbage, but we doubt if their previous ideas of the great heroic characters, Sull, Samuel, David, and Jonathan, will receive any important prompting from this praiseworthy but rather solemn gloss on a story which, in England, is still a household word. Mr. F. W. Smith has written what might be called a mystery story of the emotions. Like the author of a detective novel, Mr. Smith uses his pages with false clues, and it is not until the last few pages of a book by no means short that the reader knows who is in love with Catherine and who is love with Rhea. Catherine and Rhea are the two daughters of Ferdinand, the eldest and most emotional of the three. The greater part of the book is taken up with long and tortuous conversations about the possible relationships of the characters. Ferdinand is terrified that Catherine, his elder, more timid, and less emotional daughter, is in love. vain, and less emotional daughter, is in love with Jabez Talbot, an earnest North-American Socialist, whose brutality is a continual agony for him, but it is Rhoda, the younger, more volatile girl, about whom he has separate but no less dreadful fears, who eventually marries Jabez. Young at Rest is the story of an unsuccessful marriage. Lindsey Bordon, who inherited a certain idealistic asceticness and a strong will, from his father, falls in love with the lovely Camilla Neale, who is 19. Camilla's father is a rich businessman, and has never tampered with her daughter. Camilla gets her penis from her penniless lover, who has chosen the profession of veterinary surgeon in Liverpool, and in getting him she meant to get him wholly. Here she failed. Love, for Camilla, meant an amorous dalliance in a life of ease, and she trusted in her power to use passion as the means of weaning Lindsay from a life full of poverty and strenuous endeavour and of bridging him into the opulent world of the Neale family. The major part of this novel is a detailed description of the battle between Lind's will and the Nale family. It is beautifully done with a great deal of detail of the domestic kind.",,

MR. CAPEK
Alnong now novels are ETZEL ANDEnGAST, by JAcon WASSERMIfANN, translated by CYRUS BROOI;S (Allen and Unwin, lOs. not); TAI,ES FiOm TwVo POCKETS, by KAI1EL CAPEK, translated by PAUL SELVER (Faber and Faber, 7s. 6d. net); and TIIE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF ALOYSIUS O'CALLAGIRAN, by TIOAIAS WASHINGTONMETCALFE (Heinemann, 7s. 6d. net.).
As a sustained pieco of intellectual virtuosity ETZEL ANDEROAST iS as remarkable a performanco as any that Herr Wassermann has to his credit. Tlhe name will be familiar to readers of his previous book, "" The Maulrizius Case,"" but this is in no sense a sequel to an earlier story. It is a massivQ novel, long, crowded, and philosoplhical in the author's habitual style, and it exhibits fromn beginning to end his singtilar power to dramatizo metaphysical and ethical issues. The tluree principal cliaracters are zall soImlewlhat sUperlhumilanl -intellecttul supermen of varying types. Tlhere is a scientist named Irleni, who has returned from Central Africa stricken with an obscure disease and meets death -with invincible coniposure. There is the provincial doctor who attends him, a Joseph Kerkhoven, a man with marked latent force of personality. Ancd there is Etzel, the incarnation of Gcerman intellectual youth and its neurosis of spirit after tlhe War. It is after Irlen has died and Kerk-loven has become an eminent psychiatrist in Berlin that Etzel appears on the scene as representative of his generation. Ho falls under the spell of Kerk-hoven's healinog mind and acknowledges himself the latter's disciple. Herr WVassermamn's power of intellectual invention is nowhere more evident, than here.
TALES FROMi Two POCKETS wlill give a great deal of pleasure to all those whlvo appreciate this author's genial humlour and are not too solemn about crime. It would seem almost. impossible to be solemn about crime in Czechoslovakia if these tales aro typical. Even thoirgh violence occurs. and though police oflicers -have lard woork to discover its plerpetrator, and thoughl revolvers go bang and peasants hit their relations on the head, an atmosphere of fiiendliness and give-and-take, no doubt based on the still primitive risticity of life in these parts, envelops the relations of criminal, sufferer, aimd police. Mr. Capek conveys that all humian hcarts are innocent in intention, but we are all sinners and must do tho best wte can for ono anotlher, as Detective Holub did for the matrimonial swNindler Pliclita, or the Judgae wished to do for Vondracek. wlho killed his faitlher-in-law for wishing to scl a family field to a stranger. Wlhat. happened to the carpet-dealer wlho disappeared or how the actor Benda was done away with, not to speak of the Nobel Prize winner's exposuro of an error of justice that. was no error at all-all these thinigs the reader will learn, not wvithout lauglter.
The adventures wlhich befell Alovsius ,O'Callaghan during 70 years packed with themii are of tvo kinds-both excellent, bit. so different. from one another in their effect. on the reader that. it is as if he were being transported at intervals at the whim of Mr. T. Washington-Metcalfe from a real world in wvhichl he is made to feel tragic pity to the world of the boy's book in wvhich the worst possible slhip's cook is clubbed by the tallest possible cannibal and then consumed, to the extent of the cannibal's leavings, by the longest possible snake. ""And then some ""-as they might say in the mining settlement in the iXVest of America wlhere Aloysius, wIo is required to take a lhanid in all the aclventures, is sent to do his boxingr. This boxing adventure is typical of the author's humour. gusto, anid lavishness in culminating in the departure of Alovsius -to wlhomII the mloment they heard of hiim the local newspapers awarded the title of

Also new are the novels EXODE and ENTERTAINMENT, by James Casper, translated by Charles Babbage and John Updike, op. 8, and TIES OF TOWN, by Kierkegaard, translated by Paul Selby and Barbara Fair, o. 6 and 8. A sustained period of intellectual virtuosity is as remarkable as any that Mr. Waterman has to his credit. The name will be familiar to readers of his previous book, The Man Who Wasn't There, but this is no sense in a sequel to an earlier story. It is a long novel, long, clunky, and psychologically complex in the author's usual style, and it exhibits from beginning to end its unique power to dramatize metaphysical and ethical issues. The three protagonists are all young intellectuals who have experienced the trauma of war and adolescence. There is a scientist named Irlene, who has returned from central Africa with an obscure disease and encounters death with an invincible compassion. There is the provincial doctor who attends to him, a Joseph Krchoven, a man with a marked lack of personality. And there is Etzel, the incarnation of German intellectual youth and the neurosis of the postwar German civil war. It is after Irlene has died and Kerkegaard has become an eminent psychiatric surgeon in Berlin that Etzel appears on the scene as representative of this generation. Whoever falls under the spell of Keats's charm and mental health acknowledges himself as the latter's disciple. The power of the literary mind is no more evident than in this. TALES FROM ABOVE will give a great deal of pleasure to all those who appreciate this author's genial humour and are not too concerned about crime. It would seem almost impossible to be so passionate about crime. in Czechoslovakia if these tales were typical. Even though violence occurs, and police officers have to work hard to discover its cause, and even though red-hot peppers are sprayed at random and people hit their heads on the head, an atmosphere of friendliness and give-and-take, no doubt based on the still more primitive nature of life in these parts, envelops the relations of criminals, soldiers, and police. Mr. Capote conveys that all human beings are innocent in intention, but we are all sinners and must do what we can for another, as the detective who killed the matriarchal figure Nicholas Penzial, or the judge who wished to do the same for Lady Diana. who killed his father-in-law for wishing to sell a family field to a stranger. What happened to the car-dealer who disappeared or how the murder of Benjamn was done away with, not to speak of the Nobel Prize winners who were exposed to an error of justice that was no error at all - all these things the reader will learn, not without delay. The adventures which befell Aristophanes, Callan and others during their 70s and '70s are of two kinds - excellent, but very different from one another in their effect on the reader. It is as if he were being transported at intervals at the will of Mr. T. Washington-Metcalf from a real world in which he is made to feel tragic guilt to the world of the boy books in which the worst possible spoils are clubbed together by the most terrible cannibals and then consumed, to the extent that the longest possible snake. And then, as they might say in the mining settlement in the southwest of America where Alonzo is, who is required to take a hand in all the adventures, is sent to do his job. This adventure is typical of the author's humour. and such heavy alliteration as might befall the king in the local newspaper - when he won the war or the Spanish war, or both.",,

PLEA FOR SIMPLICITY.
HOW TO PLAY BrI.Lianws. By Tom NEW-
mAN. (Methuen. Ss. 6d.)
*Most people have at one time or another had their inaccuracy in the striking of a billiard ball illustrated by a simple method. This consists in placing the ball on the centre spot of the balk line, aiming straight up the table over the line of spots, and keeping the tip of the cue still after the ball has been struck. If the ball has been accurately struck it should hit the tip of the cue on the return journey, but it is a humiliating fact that it generally does nothing of the sort. Nexwman says that he would like his pupils ""to practise that solo-ball shot for an hour or two every day for at least a month before reading another word of mv book ""; but let not the reader take fright, for he admits, rather wistfully, that this is too much to ask. His advice is quoted only to give a very faint notion of the hard labour that a professional billiard player must undergo, and also to show that the amateur who is to get full value from professional instruction needs a table of his own and abundant leisure.
Even for those, however, who have not these advantages, the Champion has written an interesting and helpful book. It is at once admirably simple and detailed. Not only does Newman write in a plain, direct way, but he brushes aside some of those knowing and mysterious complexities both of language and execution which the amateur loves. It is not till nearly half-way through the book that he will allow his pupil to attempt anything beyond hitting the ball plumb in the middle. About page 90 he introduces side with the playing of a jenny, and lets himself indulge in a brief rhapsody on the "" side-laden ball sizzling into the pocket""; ;but, even so, he is very austere.
CUE-CONTACTS.
The terms ""check"" and ""running"" side he would ""like to cut clean out of the billiard vocabulary "" ; right and left are good enough for him, and he is down like a hundred of bricks on those who advise "".a little bit of top"" or ""a little bit of side "" for strokes which are "" legitimately wvithin the scope of plain-ball strikinz."" HIe gives a very instructive diagram sbowving five "" cue-contacts "" on the ball. The first is, of course, the central contact, and the others are those for full right-hand side, full left-hand side, full top, and full screw. Newman assures his pupil that he will play very good billiards indeed if he never worries much about any others, and adds that he himself ""might easily play for days on end in first-class professional billiards without ever utilizing more side, top, or screw than is obtainable from these cue-contacts.""
So much for Newman's severe simplicity, and a very good example of his care for detail is to be found in his advice as to stance. Premising that he is himself 5ft. 9in., with arms rather long for his height, and that the ball is on the centre spot of the balk line, and that he proposes to play it straight up the table, he gives the exact distance in inches between the face of the balk cushion and his two feet respectively. Similarly, he measures the distance between the knuckle of the forefinger of his bridge hand and the balk line. Thus the student, making allowances for difference 'in physique, can place himself as nearly as may be exactly in the champion's attitude before he sets, out to learn to swing his cue. All through the book similar measurements are given, and there is nothing vague and undecided, nothing that is not clean cut.
Another famous billiard player, Mr. Sidney Fry, has lately advised amateurs to look at the cue ball when making a stroke. Newman is not of this school. He wants us to look at the object ball, and says that he himself, besides doing this, "" visualizes the cotnmencement of the line of departure of the cue ball immediately after ball-to-ball contact in the case of a losing hazard or, cannon, or of the object ball in the case of a winning hazard."" The two great men do not agree-that is clear -but Mr. Fry admits that the professionals are so perfect in cue delivery that they can afford to look at the object ball, whereas the average amateur is anything but perfect, and is apt to move his body. To keep the eye on the cue ball does surely help towards keeping the body from that fatal jack-in-the-box movement.
AN ILL-JUDGED STROKE.
It is amusing to turn for a moment from Newman's book to that of Mr. Edward Russell Mardon, written in 1844. It was in that year that Mr. Mardon played, at the great Kentfield's rooms at Brighton, a match of 500 up against a certain Mr. Porker, who gave him a start of 25. Mr. Porker reached 496: -Mr. Mardon, a very Inman of defensive tactics, gave a miss: Mr. Porker rashly let fly at the red ball, whereupon Mr. Mardon, amid frenzied excitement, ran out with 25 unfinished. He was so much impressed bv this performance that he wrote a book all about it. Possibly he was rather a ridiculous old gentleman: he was fond of talking about himself and of the noble earls and marquises with whom he played, but he wrote very good sense, for all that. "" Simplehazard striking free from all gallery claptrap attraction, and from every kind of useless embellishment ""-that was his motto. It was his desire "" to induce those already enamoured of the pursuit to abandon the uncertain, dashing style of game, and to adopt one based on simplicity of action combined with proper strength.""
Mr. Mardon, though he despised a ""florid hazard striker."" was rather a florid writer, and Newman is a simple, straightforward one, but their sentiments are the same. If billiards be played on the asphodel, it is pleasanat to picture M. Mardon enjoying himself by setting out the balls as in Newman's diagrams. He may even draw the attention of his late adversary to them. "" Ah, my dear sir,"" he will say, "" here is a very sensible young man. You should read what he says. He agrees with me entirely. And you know, my dear Mr. Porker, you never should have made that ill-judged and temerarious stroke at the red ball.""",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS101258296/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=40da7b8f,"A New Books on Bicycles.

If the ball is accurately struck it should hit the tip on the cue on the return trip, but it is a humiliating fact that it generally does nothing of the sort. Newman says that he would like his pupils to practice the single-ball shot for an hour or two every day for at least a month before reading another word of his book but let not the reader take fright, for he admits, rather wistfully, that this is too much to ask. His advice is quoted only to give a very faint notion of the hard labour that a professional billiard player must undergo, and also to show that the amateur who is to get full value from professional instruction needs a table of his own and abundant leisure.

The terms check and running side he would like to cut out of the billiard vocabulary right and left are good enough for him, and he is down like a hundred bricks on those who advise a little bit of top or a little piece of side for strokes which are legitimately within the scope of plain-ball throwing.

Thus the student, making allowances for difference in physique, can place himself as nearly as possible exactly in the champion's attitude before he sets out, to learn to swing his cue. All through the book similar measurements are given, and there is nothing vague and undistributed, nothing that is not clean cut. Another famous billiard player, Mr. Sidney Fry, has lately advised amateurs to look at the cue ball when making a stroke. Newman is not of this school. He wants us to look at it, and says that he himself, besides doing this, visualizes the continuation of the line of departure of the cueball immediately after ball-to-ball contact in the case of a losing hazard, or canon, or of the object ball in the cause of a winning hazard. The two great men do not agree - that is clear - but Mr. Fry admits that the professionals are so perfect in cue delivery that they can afford to look at their object ball, whereas the average amateur is anything but perfect, and is apt to move his body.

It was in that year that Mr. Mardon played, at the great Kentfields room at Brighton, a match of 50 against a certain Mr. Peter, who gave him a start of 25. Mr. Peter reached 496 - Mr. Bardon, a very industrious man of defensive tactics, gave a miss when Mr. Peter rashly let fly at the red ball, whereupon Mr. Maron, in his frenzied excitement, ran out with 25 unfinished. He was so impressed by this performance that he wrote a book about it. Possibly he was rather a ridiculous old gentleman who was fond of talking about himself and of the noblest and most distinguished men and women with whom he played, but he wrote very good, solid prose, for all that. Strictly speaking, he struck fearlessly from all manner of claptrap and from every kind of useless embellishment - that was his motto. It was his desire to induce those already enamoured of the pursuit to abandon the uncertain, dashy style of game, and to adopt one based on simplicity of action combined with proper strength. Mr. Mardon, though he disliked a florid hazard, was rather florescent, and Newman was a simple, straightforward man, but his feelings were the same. If billiards are to be played on the table, it is pleasant to picture Mr. Bardon enjoying himself by setting out the balls as in Newmans diagrams.

Memoirs are made of this
Lost sisters, damaged fathers, mad husbands - everybody with a family has a tale to tell. But Bel Mooney wonders if their stories are really fact or fiction
THE TITLE OF MARY LOUDON'S last book offers insight into the complexity of memoir. Secrets and Lives was an oral history of the people of Wantage in the Studs Terkel tradition. Yet the fact that the brain automatically supplies ""lies"" instead of ""lives"" is a reminder of the central problem of life-writing. As the most ordinary lives contain secrets, truth is always a relative stranger — belonging to no one yet claimed by the imagination, with its whisper of ""what if? Six volumes of memoir sit on my desk, of which two are outstanding, and all compulsively readable. Some sort of family dysfunction is the sine qua non for each. Loudon's own Relative Stranger sets out to give ""a life after death"" to her older, schizophrenic sister who took on a male identity; John Burnside's A Lie About My Father evokes ""the dark, bruised presence"" of the damaged father who damaged his son. Mother Country by Jeremy Harding is the poignantly understated tale of two mothers, natural and adoptive — ""real and imagined""; while Horatio Clare writes the biography of a divorce in pellucid prose. Keeping Mum (Brian Thompson) and A Secret Madness (Elaine Bass ) dissect two bizarre marriages in the sepia hues of 1940s and 1950s austerity. Such summings-up are inevitably simplistic; each memoir is a complex universe in itself, and all employ some ofthe narrative methods ofthe novel. Ten years ago, such life stories would probably have been seen through the prism of fiction: the personal universalised by art — even at the level of the roman a clef. Today ""real"" life is easier to market: memoir is the form for our time. Mary Loudon's opening sentence launches briskly into shock: ""On the 27th January 2001, while I was skiing fast down a mountain in France, my sister Catherine was dying slowly in England; in a hospital I didn't know she had been admitted to, from a cancer I didn't know she had, under an identity I had no idea existed."" Her quest was to find answers: ""I could not let her go without an effort. I did not want to claim her, only to
locate her... I wanted to find... the family member we had lost and preserve some of her essence for good."" This she achieves triumphantly with a novelist's eye for detail — even nudging the heartbreaking chaos of her sister's terrible flat towards the transforming beauty of still life. Catherine Loudon lived her final years as a man, and Mary's efforts to understand why leads her into encounters with some extraordinary characters, among them Mr Carpenter, the mortuary technician who displays respect and grace; Karen the Care Worker who tells how ""Stevie"" played the piano; George from the corner shop whose care in the simple ways of sandwiches and tobacco prompts an epiphany about human kindness worthy ofthe author of Middlemarch: ""In every village, every town, every city and every country there are people like George doing kind, decent, selfless things simply because to do those things is right."" Vivid, true and moving. This is memoir as painstaking investigation: Loudon's conversations are recorded, and she does not speculate, but alternates her quest with telling anecdote and (most sad) the 1973 diary of their father, who travelled fruitlessly to India to bring his mentally ill daughter home. Gradually, as Cathy's character is rounded out and her damaged life given dignity and meaning, Loudon is changed too, as if the journey towards her lost sister adds new dimensions of complexity and humility to her own life. Behind this is another voice — that of the cool writer for whom everything is grist and method is all: ""Objectifying an experience is part of the distillation necessary to turn it into something readable..."" Sentences themselves impose order: the act of writing is as healing as the quest itself. The poet and novelist John Burnside quotes a line from Marguerite Duras which translates as: ""It is the unknown you carry within — to write, it's that or nothing."" He takes the idea of memoir as self-discovery a stage further than
MATT HERRING/GETTY ; >■• ' ■' 'r'?^'; ,,,' > ''-v. vi\Sj.^ ■ * ,
Loudon, not flinching from his own drug abuse, psychosis and estrangement from the bullying, inadequate father who ruined his ufe—and arguably created the writer. Burnside lays down a challenge in the Lie of his title and his first statement: ""This book is best treated as a work of fiction."" He consciously conjures up stories (""I can imagine him so easily in the telling. .."") about the father who lied so much about his own background that Burnside did not know until after his death that he had been left on a doorstep in West Fife. This account of a failed father-son relationship is written with extraordinary beauty and insight, repeatedly opening Chinese boxes of meaning: ""A photograph, a family story, the recollections of some old-timer at a wedding or funeral, are works of art, not facts"", and ""However hard you try to avoid it, fatherhood is... something that is not only told to, but told by, others."" His sophisticated sensibility occasionally sounds a false note, as when Father takes them to a cut-price warehouse for bargains. ""When... we picked out what we wanted, I was struck by the sadness of our possessions... worthless, ill-made objects..."" The child clutching the cheap tennis racket is only 10, so
when Burnside recalls being ""sad and ashamed"" this is surely ""all after the fact, all construction"". He knows that the distinction between transformation and invention is fine, so after describing the solitary life of the father he did not see, he hauls us back to reality: ""I'm sure my father felt these things—but these are my words, and this is the real lie about my father. I cannot talk about him without talking about myself, just as I can never look at myself in the mirror without seeing his face."" His is a profound meditation on the life of the spirit, and all the shadows we carry in our hearts. Life-writing is a yardstick by which you can measure your own story, offering insight and consolation in equal measure. When James Frey's bestselling memoir, A Million Little Pieces, was revealed to be largely fiction, it sparked this riposte from his publisher, Nan Talese. ""Memoir is personal recollection. It is not absolute fact. It's how one remembers what happened."" But what if it happened before you were born? Horatio Clare tackles this head-on in his account of his parents' doomed 1960s dream of family life on a bleak Welsh hill farm. He has reconstructed from his parents' stories and diaries ""and supplied the rest from my imagina-
tion"". Why? ""I needed to try to see the world as it was then, through the eyes of a young couple who tried to make it turn for them. I hoped, by telling the story, to understand it better."" Loudon and Burnside are breathing life into the dead but Clare's subjects are living, and he is aware ofthe pitfalls: ""I fear in its intrusion and exposure this book may distress its subjects, the people I love most."" The requirement that memoir must read like fiction can lead to absurdity. Clare apparently recalls verbatim an exchange with his father when he was 6, and Elaine Bass tells the bleak story of her postwar marriage to a man with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder in reams of direct speech, that are in the end exasperating and make the suspension of disbelief impossible. The press release says that this ""reads like a novel"", and I found myself wishing that Mrs Bass, who is 84, had done a Mary Wesley and told her story as fiction, instead of allowing it to fall between two stools. But had she done so she would have been lucky to find a publisher. Similarly Brian Thompson's wonderful wartime childhood is apparently told with the help of Mary Loudon's taperecorder, the conversations between the 9-year-old and his dysfunctional Yank-loving mum as vivid as screenplay. The line between fact and fiction is thoroughly blurred. As Jeremy Harding says, ""wild conjecture is always ready to fill the gaps"". Does it matter? We live in a culture where phrases such as ""virtual reality"" and ""creative nonfiction"" have meaning, and where the television schedules are dominated by flyon-the-wall and confessional. Dave Peltzer has perfected the genre of memoir as self-harm, and for every Angela's Ashes there is a refutation by an aggrieved sibling. The internet is awash with bloggers' lives and recently Blake Morrison (master ofthe ""intrusive"" memoir) said on Radio 4 that more lives of ordinary people should be recorded. With luck one or two will contain literary gems like this from Harding: ""There was a trace of dusk about the early afternoon on Ladbroke Grove. As the cloud let up, a brief burst of sunlight raked a No 52 bus. The inside of the lower deck glowed like a church, as though each passenger had lit a spill and held it up at the window.""

Louise Bohlen's Relative Stranger sets out to give a life after death to her older, schizophrenic sister who took on a man identity. John Burnside's A Lie About My Father evokes the dark, bruised presence of the father who has injured his son. Mother Country by Jeremy Harting is the poignantly understated tale of two mothers, natural and artificial, both real and imagined, while Horatio Clare writes the biography of a divorce in pulsating prose. Keeping Up With Bill Thompson and A Secret Life by Elaine Bass examine two bizarre marriages in the sepia-toned 1960s and '70s. Such summarisings are inevitably simplistic, for each memoir is a complex universe in itself, and all its inhabitants employ some of the narrative methods of the novel. Ten years ago, such life stories would have been seen through the prism of the personal fiction universalised by art even at the level of the Roman cat.

In every village, every town, every city and every country there are people like Mr. Smith, doing kind, decent, selfish things because doing those things is right. Vivid, true, and moving. This is a memoir as much an investigation as Louise's conversations are. as well as an investigation into the lives of Louis and Cathy, and she does not speculate, but she alternates between telling anecdotes and the more sad and lonely diary of their father, who travelled to India to bring his mentally ill daughter home.

I Now Barabbas Was a Rotter
By Brian Masters
(Hamish. Harw4lton, £6.95)
Marie Corelli was a startling and worrying phenomenon: a writer whose books far and away outsold everyone's else's, who made well' over £15,000 a year from them round about the turn of the century, and who was the second most famous woman in England. But, as everyone knows, her novels were tosh, and the vituperation they attracted from the critics is unmatched.
- Brian Masters has researched her life with impeccable thoroughness, chasing her letters to Detroit, Claremont and Urbana and an old suitcase in a Stratford outhouse, tracking down her famous gondola to a film studio prop-man's yard, transcribing accounts. *of this libel action and that vendetta, discovering her training her dog to destroy all bad, notices and describing as ""impertinence)"" an income tax inspector's request for a sight of her royalty statenments.
She was, quite obviously, a monstre sacre of almost unparalleled a,wfulness: proud, complacent, vain, snobbish, a fearful liar, a constant torment to her publishers, ungrateful to those who befriended and admired her, spitting and fuming' at those who ignored her. But in the end, she was after all an ' immeasurably ' sad woman, desperately lonelv anid basically insecure, cursed by the possession of an insatiable artistic instinct but 'only the very faintest talent.
It is here that Mr Masters fails her and his readers. He writes as noisily us Corelli berself, crying down her every action and instinct, her every book, belittling even her relatively few generous instinctsher tactless attempts to help the starving Ouida, her cheque to the mother of an insane man who apparently tried to assassinate her. While this is certainly a fascinating and highly readable biography, it would have been a great dealbetter if the author could have summoned a little more svmpathy for his subject.
Time and again his case is weakened by the stridency of his comment (one would have thought someone capable of a title as meaningless as Now Barabbas Was a Rotter wvould throw his own stones more carefully). Finally, he drives us into Corelli's arms-the last place one would want to be; one's heart bleeds for the unfortunate Arthur Severn, a second-rate artist with whom, at the age of 56, the novelist fell violently bat alas platonically in love. Even _Mr Masters seems touched bv the impossibility of Corelli in love: Malvolio has nothing on her. But it is not until the penultimate chapter, in which he examines her novels-The Sorrows of Satan, The Mighty Atom and the rest-with more moderate and careful attention, that there are signs of how much better a book this could have been.

18TH-CENTURY ITALY
THE SON OF MARIETrA. By JOHAN
FABRICIUS. Translated from the Dutch *by IRENE CLEPHANi and DAVID HALLETh (Gollancz. 9s. 6d.)
Long before the reader has reached the last of these 1,053 pages it has become sufficiently plain that its prodigious length is not the most remarkable thing about this novel of eighteenth-century Italy. The supreme gift of the creative imagination, for which so bold and ambitious a venture encourages the hope at the outset, is not to be discovered here; but this is an astonishingly well sustained piece of story-telling, rich in character and in the excitement of the drama of incident.
For two-thirds of the book the scene is the old episcopal town of Todi, where one of the women belonging to a troupe ot travelling players abandons her child, 'the infant Marietta,'who is brought up by a very prince of rascals among innkeepers. At the convent where she flies for protec-' tion at the age of 13 the child wins the attention of the new Bishop of Todi, an admirable study of the subtle and erring ecclesiastic of Venetian society. Though Monsignore is resolved to save his soul by marrying Marietta to the boy who adores her, the child which she eventually bears in Rome is his, not her husband's. A climax is reached in the Bishop's unpremeditated yielding to passion.
The second part describes Benedetto's childhood in Todi, and is likewise marked by unusual psychological penetration. He is a strange, sombre'little boy, untouchecr by the motives and passions of his kind. The evil to which he is as it were predestined is suggested with notable skill and. dramatic force. In the third and last part of-the novel, the scene of which is Venice,' where he has fled with the jewels with' which' a-rich old lady was buried in the family vault, Benedetto struggles in vain against his destiny, which, in Novalis's phraserjischaracter:'Notfeven MonsTgnore can save him from the scaffold, since in the end the youth has no. further, desire to live. It is a crowded and vivid and .firmly disciplined story, which holds the reader's respect and admiration' all through.
IN THE SECOND YEAR. By STORM JAMESON.
Cassell. 7s. 6d..
In her new novel Miss Storm Jameson takes us forward to 1940, to an England destroyed by a dictatorship. The writers '~and thinkers seem' to' be populating prisbn camps where they are being taught social behaviour by starvation and flogging, while the few who escape prison are in risk of brutal murder or suicide. The country is in dire poverty; food is scarce except among the oligarchy ; even the dictators murder each other judicially.
It is impossible not to recognize the art with which Miss Jameson describes her prisons and her murders; but it is in the psychology of the English people and their imagined tyrants that she seems to go completely astray and to lose the sense of reality which we have always expected of her since-her 'stories of Yorkshire shipyards and their workers. A book such as this cannot be judged purely as a work of art; it is too frankly a sincere and passionate piece of propaganda. If Miss Jameson's horror of dictatorships in other lands has hurt her so badly that she felt she must make a protest it would have been wiser to place the story in some couiritiy where things like these may be possible; in taking England for her biackground she has stultified her work.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS285552196/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=1df57de4,"New novels by 18th-century Italian writers.

Before the reader has reached the last page of these 1123 pages, it has become sufficiently clear that its prodigious length is not the most remarkable thing about this novel of the eighteenth century. The supreme gift of the creative imagination, for which so much beauty and energy is required at the outset, is not to be discovered here but in this astonishingly well sustained piece of story-telling, rich in character and the excitement of the dramatic incident. For the first two thirds of the book the scene is the old episcopal town of Todi, where one of the women belonging to a traveling troupe of players abandons her child, Maria, who is brought up by a very rich family of innkeepers. At the convent where she flies for protection at the age of three the child wins the attention of the new Bishop of Turin, an admirable study of the subtler and more erroneous aspects of Italian society. Though Monsignor Benet is determined to save his soul by marrying Maria to the boy who adores her, the child which she eventually bears in Rome is not his, but hers. A climax is reached in the Bishop's unplanned surrender to passion. The second part of the book describes Benito's childhood in Todi and is likewise marked by unusual psychological penetration. He is a strange, sombre little boy, unhappily married to the boy whom he adores. The evil to which he is destined is one which he cannot avoid. It is suggested with considerable skill and dramatic force. In the third and last part of the novel, the scene of which is Venice, where he has fallen in love with the girl whom he loves. old lady is buried in the family vault, Benedetto struggles in vain against his destiny, which, in the novel's phrase, ""no one can save him from the scaffold, since in the end the youth has no further desire to live.

In her new novel, Miss Jameson takes us forward to 1940, when England is occupied by a dictatorship. The writers and the thinkers seem to be inhabiting prison camps where they are being taught social behaviour by starvation and flogging, while the few who escape are in danger of murder or suicide. The country is in deep poverty and food is scarce, except among the oligarchs who murder each other judicially. It is not possible to recognise the art with which Miss Jameson describes her prisons and her murders, but it is in the psychology of the English people and their imagined tyrannical partners that she seems to go completely astray and to lose the sense of reality which we have always expected of her - from her stories of the Yorkshire shipyards and their workers. A book such as this cannot be judged purely as a work of art; it is a deeply sincere and passionate piece of propaganda. If Miss Jameson's horror of dictatorships in other countries had hurt her so badly that she felt she must make a political statement, it would have been wiser to place the story in some arbitrary place where things like this may be possible, taking England as her background for her statement and stifling her work.",,

has returned.to the 18th-century setting of an earlier bestseller, Chatterton. , Mingling fact and fiction to entirely plausible effect, The Lambs of London is set in the mid-1790s, when Charles Lamb, then a few years into what was to be a 30-year career at the East India Company, was recovering from a nervous breakdown. Nursing him was his beloved sister, Mary — herself on the verge of the fit of insanity that was td cause her, a year or two later, to murder their mother. Among the other characters who people this vividly realised world is the antiquarian bookseller and sometime forger William Ireland. The platonic but intense romance between the latter and Mary Lamb is the focus of the story, which ends — as, indeed, does the love affair — when Ireland is unmasked as a fraud and Mary, distracted by grief, commits the terrible crime for which she remains notorious. The author's re-creation of these events is masterly. His feeling for the language of his chosen period is as sharp as one has come to expect. But it is in the realisation of the characters — poor, troubled Mary and her dipsomaniac sibling; gifted, over-reaching Ireland, and a host of others — that Ackroyd excels. Tender, funny and humane, this is as good as anything he has written.

But then she is asked to participate in a top-secret project aimed at teenage girls. Gradually, she starts to understand the insidious nature of PopCo's marketing strategy, and to realise that she no longer wants to be part of it. While some interesting points are made about the way that children have been inveigled by big business into becoming avid consumers, the novel is more than just a timely anti-capitalist rant. Full of cryptograms, digressions on treasure hunting, the politics of vegetarianism, and code-breaking lore, it offers much more subtle pleasures. The best thing, in fact, is the character of Alice — a self-confessed ""geek"" with a fondness for mathematical theorems, homoeopathy, and stylishly unstylish clothes. Brought up to prefer books to television, and ideas to fashion, she feels like an outsider in a materialist world.

and overall generosity of outlook, it is in much the same vein as Jewell's bestselling debut, Ralph's Party. Here, as in her earlier books, the ups and downs of relationships are dissected, and the improbability of true love ever running smooth is wryly pointed up. When 19-year-old Vince meets shy, beautiful Joy on a Norfolk campsite, it seems as if his problems with girls are over. But then the couple are separated by one of those misunderstandings so common in this kind of fiction, and don't meet again until years later, by which time both are on the verge of getting married to someone else. Nor is this the end of their troubles. A possessive husband, an ill-timed pregnancy and a certain mutual inertia seem likely to keep them apart indefinitely. Fortunately, help is at hand in the form of a psychic cat... ' Like all romantic comedies, Vince & Joy has its predictable side — but that doesn't mean that it lacks suspense. The skill with which the author delays the inevitable moment when the two main characters get together keeps the reader guessing as to the outcome right up to the end. And there are some well-observed vignettes of contemporary urban life, as well as a quartet of loveably eccentric flatmates to add zest to the mix.

Like an escapee from an Iris Murdoch novel unaccountably caught up in a Douglas Coupland plot, it is she who keeps the reader reading when the worthy rhetoric begins to pulsate. POPCO by Scarlett Thomas, Harper Perennial, 7.99 and 7.99 respectively. This delightfully quirky novel about the evils of globalisation is narrated by Alice, the descendant of Bletchley Park code-breakers and a professional setter of crossword puzzles. LOW. I WOULD-I-MAY. i-V-I-K. With its overall generosity of outlook, it is in much the same vein as Joanna's bestselling debut, The Pink Panther. Here, as in her earlier books, and downs of relationships are discussed, and the possibility of true love ever running out is wryly pointed up. When 19-year-old Vince meets beautiful, voluptuous Joanna on a Norfolk camping trip, it seems as if his problems with girls are over. But then the couple are separated by one of those misunderstandings so common in this kind of fiction, and they don't meet again until years later, by which time both are on the verge of getting married to someone else. Not this is the end of their troubles. A possessive husband, an ill-timed pregnancy and a certain mutual inertia seem likely to keep them apart indefinitely. Fortunately, help is at hand in the form of a psychic cat... Like all romantic comedies, Vince Joy has its predictable side but that doesn't mean that it lacks suspense. The skill with which the author delays the inevitable moment when the two main characters get together keeps the reader guessing as to the outcome right up to the end. And there are some well-observed vignettes of everyday life, as well as a quartet of loveably eccentric flatmates to add zest to the mix. JOY by Lisa Jowell, Penguin Randomhouse, 6.99 & 68.64 pp. No in-flight novelist should be without at least one novel of this kind, the ideal antidote to airplane hang-ups. With its light-hearted plot, likeable characters, and beautifully drawn settings.",,

THE LEADER. By LLOYD EVANS. Hodder
and Stoughton. Ss. 6d.
Almost anything that is past may claim the title of history. Historians have commandeered the word for their owvn province, but what are their parliamen.s and dynasties, their campaigns. defeats. and empires without the multifarious private man ? It is he. with his small ejaculations, his jotting in a notebook how Lizzie'; dress was yellow or the headsman's axe not sharp. who gives depth to the recurring pageants of his rulers. It is he who sees Aunt Benilett in the crowd, or a dark ladv. or an aciress Pepvs admired. or one of Chaucer's ori2inals. and so distingtuislhes for us between one age and another. These private persons become part of the storv merely by having existed. and though the historian cannot spare time to write of them the novelist can.
Even so. there are degrees in recognition. Some see the simple figure: onil
a few perceive. like Mrs. Radice with Noi ALL SLEEI, that around the private man is a whole world of gardens, houses. scents. sights, sounds, which is not his alone but which he shares with many other men. Everything he has seen or done, tasted or felt, and everything he has been told, has an equal right to be admitted to his story: you cannot separate the man from these withotit an ampuiation. In this case the story is of James Hammond. the poctaster. who went to The Hague with Lord Chesterfield's embassv for George 11 and died young and is reputed to remain as a ghost in his godfather's palace at Stowe. The plot. howcver. is nothing to the pictures. btit to see these properly one must dismiss the idea that cverv detail in the book is intended to advance the action. The detail is. on the contrary. the irrelevant, wandering, casually enlightening detail of a diary, whichi tells one how people danced, what they wore. what flowers grcw in their gardens, who camc in and who went out. Once you have got over the first puzzlement the eighteenth century is before you. more domestic than usual, in spite of skating parties and Embassv balls. but also infinitelv more vivid. People have colds, people make mistakes, tease lovers or irritate them, deal like human beings with princes quite as trying as human beings. with intriguing qucens who feel. like human beings. the laughter of the Court. with servants whosc comfort must be studied on the road. The concreteness of the details is saved from tie humdrum in the trim. distinguished stvle in which thev are set side bv side. and for the sake of the everydav eighteenthcentury life discovered in the book one mav forgive it the premature shadowiness of its principal character.
THE JEWS IN ENGLAND
Neither of the other historical novels to be reviewed attains this stereosconic vision, though the characters, being divorced from most of their setting. annear comparatively plainiv. The first. THE SECRET BARRIER, is chiefly, interesting for its nicture of the situation of the Jewvs in England at the end of the thirteenth centurv. To connect her story with public affairs of the time. Mrs. Hobman eniplovs the neat if rather timorous devicc of interspersing the narrative with resumes of what is happening in the State. The story itself is about the daughter of a country family who is brought to London. marries a personable young man with a Government position, bears him a familv. and then finds to her dismav. that the nian she most respects and loves is a Jewish doctor called in to attend her husband-illegally-in an cmergency, who afterwards dies in a massacre. Apart from a tendency to mock-antiquity and one arch anticipaition of one of Chaucer's commonplaces bv 50 years. the writing is plain and adequate. and one lcaves the book with a slightly clearer notion of what were the problems before King Edward 1.
Even public persons have a privatc side to their lives. and in MY KATIE GREETS You we find the exceedingly interesting private side to the life of Luther. it is all the more interesting for its very sobriety and happiness. Except for the escape from the nunnery in the beginning which xwas itself a comnoliment to Luther's teaching, nothing in Katherina Luther's story is obviously dramatic, but Ladv Evelyn Giffard has worked the accretion of domestic detail into a limited but living whole. Little is to be seen of the world outside the household at Wittenberg. but the face of the reformer in his own home is curiously familiar, as though one saw the face of anv easv-going clergyman who is hanpy in his wife and children, occasionally taken in and defrauded by strangers at the door with begging stories, but, on the whole, a good practical instance of the life he preaches. Mrs. Luther comes out as a good, solid, sensible, hard-working woman. whose ideals have gradually given way before endless family responsibilities.
OLD SAN FRANCISCO
The last two books are adventure stories. The clue to No MORE DREANS is probably that since it is about a fluent journalist this is how he would have written his story. Once that is settled one reads with amusement and interest of a young man who was much attracted by distances, even when seen in a woman's
eves, and who had to write the storv of fire and earthquake in San Francisco in the intervals of trying to find her. The time is 1906. and the picture of journalists at work and at plav-both generously assisted by alcohol-is a lively and even perhaps a good one. At any rate. NMr. Brier has caught the mixture of "" toughness"" and sentimentality for which the films have made reporters famous. and his extracts from the news stories turned out in haste bv his hero and greativ admired in the office are wonderful pieces of ncriod writing.
THE LEADER is an examnle of the odd way in which topical anxictics can still be made to yield a romantic story. The hook tells of a journalist who goes to Austria to discover for hihself what truth there is in the rumour of a new political Darty gathering undereound. and stays to become its leader. Sometimes he says "" Bah ! "" but generally he is too busy even to do that, what with the party taking him first for a traitor and an assassin and their for a hero. It is a good story as far as adventure stories go. but th- changes
in Austria havc talken some of the cotour i
out of it.

And one leaves the book with a somewhat clearer notion of what problems lay ahead for King Edward II. Even public persons have a private side to their lives.

IT'S A BATTLEFIELD. By GRAHAM GREENE.
(Hcinemann. 7s. 6d. net.)
It's a Battlefield "" is an indictment of the institutions of the day and a denial that they and the people affected by. them are governed by any intelligible principle. Mr. Graham Greene, the author, conceives London as a battlefield such as Inkerman was in the description of Kinglake-a -nist-enshrouded battlefield in which each little group of soldiers fights its own fight without reference to any general plan and without knowledge of the procedure of any other group. He emphasizes the futility of human endeavour by exhibiting it as controlled by lifeless machines such as factories and the apparatus associated with Justice-which to' him is a meaningless abstraction.
Justice proposes to hang one Drover who killed a policeman in a riot after a Communist meeting. Drover, who happened to have with him the knife of his trade, was defending his wife, whom the policeman was about to bludgeon. Various movements for a reprieve are handled in a way to illustrate human selfishness and impotence. Being concerned primarily with hysterical states of mind, Mr. Greene does not have to reckon with the probabilities in providing his outcome -that which he selects being the most repugnant possible to those affected. He is so intransigent in his distaste for the existing order that when he has occasion for a bus it has to be a pirate bus. But he has nothing to offer in exchange; though he belabours captains and rulers, be keeps his most envenomed shafts for the "" reds ""; for instance, for that advanced economist Mr. Surrogate, who ""resnted Drover's intrusion as an individual to be saved and not a sacrifice to be decked for the altar.""

BENTLEY. (Gollancz. 8s. 6d. net.)
Miss Bentley has ambitiously essayed a difficult and complicated theme as the subject: of her second long novel, ""A Modern Tragedy,'"" by giving us a new version of the fraudulent company promoter. It is a new version because she has pitched' her scene in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and Tasker, her chief figure, is primarily a manufacturer of woollen goods, who becomes involved in juggling with his various companies and properties owing to the depressing influence of the 'Great Slump. The victim in whom we are mainly interested is a young man called Walter Haigh-not a very happy creation -whom Tasker, for his own purposes, lifts out of obscurity in order to make him the manager of a dyeing and cloth-finishing factory. Miss Bentley has apparently studied the processes of woollen manufacture at first hand, but her treatment of the methods of high finance lacks that air of assurance which brings to the reader the comfortable conviction that precisely thus and thus the thing could have happened.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS319105606/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=24bf6133,"New England.

MAYNE. (Constable. Os. net.)
A few decades hence, perhaps, some student of fiction will be able to discern that all these three books date from the nineteen-twenties. At present a striking difference among a hundred differences between them is that only one of them plainly dates. It might be said, roughly, that Mr. Michael Sadleirs novel is -of no time; Mr. Goldring's novel of the present time; Miss Mayne's stories of all time. And this is true of manner as well as of aubject. NO doubt Miss lMayne could not, or would not, have written her stories just so before, say, the year 1890; but, unless we claim that subtlety was absent from the female heart and brain before our own day, Miss Mayne's peculiar way of setting that subtlety before us is the only dated thing in her book. Mr. Sadleir's attempt at solid construction and Mr. Goldring's not unshapely picaresqueness have nothing exclusively nineteen-twentyish about them.
Mr. Sadleir is careful about his dates, in the way of one who likes the historical background of an old family and an old country house for his setting; but his story is of no time because, deliberately, he has put one part of it in the timeless levels of sensational ("" flamboyant "" is his own word) fiction, into which it is always thrilling to be conducted. -His purpose in the book was to play the fat boy in "" Pickwick"" on us by means of a coldly obscene old woman and the remains of a lewd old man, plotting together against the virtue of a girl. He avoids pretence by housing the old woman in a tower-a ""Devil's tower ""-and the old man in a palace of Fortunio in Paris; and he maintains the key and the colour without a lapse. But, unhappily for his careful planning, he grew too interested in the girl. There is nothing of the present moment in her; rather, she belongs, like Miss Mayne's nine, to all time. And the juxtaposition of this keen and humorous pursuit of the heart and brain fronmi the earnest little baclcf.ch to the flirt, from the flirt to the lover, with the "" flamboyance "" of horrible eld in its towers and its Fortunio palaces, results in a book disjointed, illfused. Mr. Sadleir makes a brave effort at the join; but it needs a wrench; and even the wrench does not "" come off."" Alltime will not fit into no-time.
A "" DocumEsT.""
Mr. Goldring is at least secure on the point of time. This novel is what they call a "" document."" Twenty years hence it might well be an historical document.

No. A few decades hence, perhaps, some student of fiction will be able to discern that all these three books date from the nineties. At present a striking difference among them is that only one of them plainly dates. It might be said, roughly, that Mr. Smith's novel is not of the time - Mr. Goldring's novel of the present time is Miss May's best work of all time. And this is true of manner as well as of subject. No doubt Miss May could not, or would not, have written her stories just so before, say, the year 1890, but, unless we claim that subtlety was absent from the female heart and brain before our own day, the peculiar way in which Miss May sets her subtlety before us is the only thing dated in her book. Mr. Smith is careful about his dates, in the way one likes the historical background of an old family and an old country house for his setting, but his story is not of time, because, deliberately, he has put one part of it into the timeless levels of sensational fusion that is his own fiction, which is always thrilling to be conducted. - His purpose in the book was to play the boy in Pinkerton's eyes by means of a coldly obscene old woman and the remains of a dead man, plotting together against the virtue of a girl. girl. He avoids pretence by housing the old woman in a tower-like room - the Devil's Tower - and the old man in a Parisian palace, and he maintains the key and the colour without a lapse. But unhappily, for his careful planning, he grew too interested in the girl. There is nothing of the present moment in her, rather, she belongs, like Miss Maynard, to all time. And the juxtaposition of this keen and humorous pursuit of the heart and brain from the very first moment to the last, from the first love affair to the very last, with the fluttering of the nightingale in its towers and its windowpanes, results in a book that is disjointed, illusory. Mr. Sellinger makes a brave attempt at the join but it needs a little work and the wrench does not come off. All time will not stand for long-term memory. A Do-Over. Mr. Goldring is at least as secure on the point of view. This novel is what they call a document. Twenty years hence it might well be an historical document. Here is the very moment - catch-up, words and phrases, all - with a glimpse into the immediate future. He chooses to show us not the stern eyes of a disapproving, uncomprehending elder, but the bewildered, pathetic eyes of one who has just ceased to be very young. A few months ago, Gilbert was a young man of forty, and the effect of his trial and disillusion was to make him, not very old, but very young. but still younger, and to swing him, not back into regression, but into what Mr. Goldring implies, and we are prepared to believe, is to be the next turn of the spiral - marriage, fidelity in comradeship, at least, and domesticity. Englishmen, says Gilbert, need a long life, in a house or a house-mate. But nobody knows. In Mr. Shakespeare's novel the marriage of the girl and her delightful guardian is the end. The implication, as always in the novel, is that they will live happily ever after. Mr. Golding and Mr. Voltaire come together in a scene of interrogation. Nobody knows - not even themselves - what they will make of it. But at any rate this is better for Gilbert than being tampered with by prostitution, and for Joanna than being a pre-mature middle-aged woman among things. And with one of the many strokes of art which one can enjoy in this very uneven book, Mr. Goldling brings out the logic of his second marriage by showing us also a case of an older kind--Toby, who used to seduce girls on principle, is definitely caught and married, in the old style, by one who is cleverer or more perseverant than the others. We should like to dwell on Lady Cleopatra, Leigh-Perkins, who is, for character, the master of a book in which most of the people are rather modern instances than men and women. But as a picture of the times, the vigorous, impudent tale is, if not overextended, shrewdly true in essence. is shrewdly true in its essence. Yet no reader with a taste for the imperious will be glad to get away from this clamour for the present and into the remoter, more subtler studies of all time. We must define modern fiction as having its psychoanalytical elements, and not just those that involve psychoanalysis or Freud's ideas. In Which is a Beautiful Woman is indeed a beautiful piece of work, partly because it is the only one of these nine stories in which Miss Marple gives herself proper room to move and the author's knowledge of psychoanalysis is apparent but the story could have been written without it. Women, since the world was made, have deepened their love for their daughters and tended to keep their bodies in check. But let Miss Marple beware of suppression. Some of these delicate searchings into the heart of the woman make one think that she feels more than she cares to show. Perhaps even more than she is sensitive to the truth of all time, she is a little tainted with a view of the present - the triumph of cleverness at the cost of feeling.",,

A JEALOUS WIDOWER
CHRISTINA. By CLAUDE HOUGHTON.
(Heinemann. 7s. 6d.)
Mr. Claude Houghton's new novel has at any rate a very striking if in some of its detail rather gruesome theme-the devastating jealousy of a newly bereaved husband who finds a packet of letters written by his wife to an unnamed lover. Peter Brand is an assertively successful business man, wvhose self-assurance has never previously permitted him the least shadow of suspicion, and the bitterness of this blow to his love and pride is unrestrained. He begins a furious search among Christina's more eccentric friends -men he had mostly refused to meet in her lifetime, bohemian artists and downat-heel journalists or neurotics whose shabby failures stand in sharp contrast to his own wealth and power, and yet each of whom he has to recognize as a possible triumphant rival. His worldly values suffer many sharp shocks before he has finished.
There is wit, wisdom, and human understanding in all Mr. Houghton writes, and much of the detail of the book is admirably done. If as a whole it hardly stands on the level of his best novels, that is because its scope is narrower without compensating increase in penetration; because the development, and especially the violent climax, seems more forced than truly dramatic; and because, finally, it- presents the sensation rather than the emotion of the central situation. We can believe in Peter Brand, but we are not compelled to feel with him.
THREE OF THE THREE MILLION. By LEON-
HARD FRANK. Translated by CYRUS
BROOKS. (Lane. 7s. 6d.)
Herr Leonhard Frank's story, written with the peculiar force of emotional suggestion which his best work-exhibits, is of three of the army of unemployed in Germany during the first terrible phase of the great depression. A clerk, a tailor, a factory hand, they are all over 40 and without hope. On an impulse of bewilderment they abandon themselves to chance, leave their native town on the Main and virtually take to the road.
The episode of the Englishman who, revisiting the scenes of his student days, paid for a dish of sausages at an inn with a £100 note which eventually fell to the incredulous tailor, is very ingeniously contrived; fate was no more sportive in this matter, after all, than the three had a right to expect. They spend the greater part of the money in travelling by steerage to Buenos Aires, where one sets up as a street bootblack, the second finds work in a cannery, and the third resumes his old trade. The tone of irony throughout is very light, but it is not the less grimly effective for that. By the time the clerk and the factory hand have returned to Germany-the tailor has died in Paraguay-the wheel has gone full circle and the hopelessness of the start has become the hopelessness of the
ending.

Amcng new novels are THE LIMIESTOXE TREE, by Joseph Hergesheimer (Heiiemann, 7s. 6d. net); and FED Up, by George A. Birminghlam (Methuen, 7s. Gd. net).
In ""The Limestone Tree,"" Mr. Hergesheimer, returning to that American past of which he always wvrites so surely and well, rises to the level of his very finest achievement, and vindicates with a finality and completeness reached only once or twice in his earlier wvork his claim to be reckoned among the major literary artists of our day. Seldom in any book has he sustained a single-or rather a mounting-level with suchI consistency as in these ten linked episodes revealing the growtth of a Kentucky family tradition practically firom Revolutionary days to the eighteen-nineties. That this is the book's especial subject appears clearly in the first and last stories. In the first Gabliel Sash, in 1776, marries Nancy Abel, only to leave her and their child a little later when the call of his beloved forests proves too much for his restless spirit. In 1890 John Dison Folkes, of Abel blood, seduces Susan Abel, and feels an identical impulse to run aw-ay from his responsibilities. But, unlike Gabriel Sash, John is ""conscious of other influences . . . the slow painful accumulation of a tradition.""
He had looked back into the past, at the bare lives of his ancestors, and seen them change with the changing state, he had watched them change Kentucky. The lives of his ancestors, one following the other, Dassionate and courageous men, generations of women with pure hearts, had created at least a substitute for a missing safety; they had learned how to meet disaster.
Tthe tales between provide a changeful panorama of Kentucky life over more than 100 years, including the tragic Civil War period. Each cf the stories has its own peculiar charm and loveliness -while all in the retrospect of the last are brought together in a unity which is as authentic as it is movin.
"" Fed Up "" is entitled to rank among the happiest of all the George A. Birmingham tales. It is the story of an election in a Somerset constituency, half mining and half agricultural. Both the candidates disappear and the election has to be carried along without them. The author makes it quite plain that he has little sympathy for electioneering and that his sympatlhies lie with the two candidates who abstract themselves with so much gusto. The story is in fact a satirical comedy. MAr. Birmingham writes quietly. All his characters are people it would not be astonishing to meet and his skill lies in gradually leading them into unusual situations. He is never fantastic, and while he is fond of exercisinlg his right to see and reveal the innermost thoughts of his characters, those thoughts are entertaining because they are obviously the thoughts Xwhich really pass through innumerable heads. Only one character is a grandly exaggerated invention, the Earl of Eppington, whose mind wanders and who achieves in consequencefeatsof logical reasonihig and mental transposition which suggest a character out of Lewis Carroll. The story could hardly stand two Earls of Eppington, but Mr. Birmingham is never tempted to overdo his effects. He imposes no strain upon our credulity. His is the most plausible of pens, but he uses it with-restraint. The Somerset election is just as such elections are, yet a series of highly entertaining happenings

Here anid there a writer may be the best judge of his own work, but the fact that R.L.S. regarded Maoniouth -with a kind of mocking complaisance, and eveii that he recited tags and' tirades out of the play, as types of ""how not to -do it,"" does not prove anything. Again and again it has happened that a great writer cherishes most fondly the book which contains; at any rate from the point of view of those readers -whose opini6n he would most value,- his least good work. Conversely, a book which has brought him great fame will be regarded with a certain distaste. One thing is certain; a wise writer, Whether obscure or noted, will do well. to destroy any work which he would blush to see printed. Fame .is a fickle jade. To take but one instance, how amazed Emily Bronte would have been.to know that the. time wi'ould come- when- "" Wuthering
Ieights"" would be placed' far above ""Jane Eyre""! In some-ways a more surprising: example of the change in literary, values is -that of T-rollope.--During the crowded years-of his working life -only one of his great contemporaries did him reverence. This was Nathaniel Haw-thorne, whose favourite English novelist he became and remained-to the end. A Library-List.
Sir Guy Fleetwood 11Vilson's ""Letters to Somebody "" is a book that people are reading. Glimpses of many distinguished Victorian writers -are to be found in its pages, including Walter- Savage Landor and the Brownings ;- the Biography of. Countess -Tolstoy -is also finding manv readers, and "".The Pomp of Power "" (which is only nominally anonymous) is deeply interesting to all those -to whom the war still offers many unsolved- problems. There is an unusual choice in new novels-a thriiller in the form of "" Mr. - Justice Maxell,"" by Mr. Edgar Wallace; a sensational story- bv Mr. James Blyth, ""The Riddle of the Marsh,"" of which the scene is 'laid in Norfolk;- ""The Happy Fool,"" by John Palmer.; ""Blindfold,"" b- Mrs. Victor Rickard, and "" Batonala,"" the curious study of negro life done from the inside aid - translated - from - the French.

While it is fortunately true - all literary history is there to prove it - that only a great writer's best work survives in any real sense, yet no one can doubt that the publication of certain juvenile works has brought more than one bad review of an author. Here and there a writer may be the best judge of his own work, but the fact that R.L.

Profitable Marketing for the Smaller Company
BY C. Graeme Roe,
Directors Bookshelf, 55s. (45s. to Inztiute of Directors members) Marketing Management for Europe
By C. S. Deverell, Butterworths 26s.
BOTH of these books are the first in projected series' Both deal with miarketing and are very informative on their selected angles. Graeme Roe's book on Profitable Marketing for the Smaller Company has intrinsic publishing interest. since it is the liast title off,the. presses. in an imprint jointly sponsored by the Institute of Directors and Gower Press.
The intention is to publish specially commissioned books aiming at the senior manager on or near the board. The titles will be expensive-to judge by this first one-but the compensation is an exceptionally usable forniat. A good idea is numbered chapter sections. rather like White Paper paragraphs, so that specific topics can rapidly be found.
Mr. C. S. Deverell's Mlarketing Management for Europe is tlhe first volume in a series that will deal Nvith ""the basic problems of British management in selling to European markets"". Very helpfully he starts with a'background description of the political-cumeconomic situation of Europe. including the main elements of the Rome Treatv and short descriptions of the business ""character' of the main nations.
He goes on to cover -the sources of information for British companies attempting to open export markets in Europe. and means for assessing the markets. Among the last are personal trips by executives, and he rightly lays stress on their importance wvhile warning that the enterprise must be logically conceived in the first place. Gently he suggests it is best not to get drunk-` ending an evening of good hospitality before it has become too much "" is his phrase-- on dinners with prospective clients.
Further chapters deal with the organization of overseas marketing and staffing and' training. The author gives examples of how other companies have historicallv dealt with problems of seling in Europe, and suggests both organizational structures and how to get help on foreign appointments. Sometimes he plods rather in the careful simplicity of explanation.
but this is definitely a virtue so long as it is expected.
The remaining topics cover product planning and design, sales promotion a id advertising, pricing and costs and some of the management techniques appropriate to overseas marketing. The organiza-ion and stvle of the book betray the academic (Mr. Deverell is head of the department of management studies at the Letchworth College of Technology), so the manager using it should expect for all its value to have the feeling of being a student.
Graeme Roe is managing director of his own company, Roe Compton, and at 33 has had great experience of the marketing world. besides holding a first class degree in economics and politics from Nottingham University. His book sets out to demonstrate that marketing skills are "" as relevant and practical to the small firm as to the large"", and it reads with the easy communicativeness appropriate to a series going straight to businessmen.
He goes through the various subdivisions of marketing, such as public relations, pricing policy, market research, the sales force. and so on. It should (slightly contrary to the declared intention of the series) go dowvn well with middle managers just as much as senior ones, if those categories are meaningful in the: smaller concernl.

THE DEPRESSION IN
LANCASHIRE
GOD'S IN His HEAVEN. By J. L. HODSON.
(Gollancz. 7s. 6d. n.)
Mr. Hodson's title, despite the wry twist given to it by his material, does not necessarily contain the implication that "" all's wrong with the world."" Lancashire in the trough of the depression may appear financially waterlogged and in danger of becoming a total loss, its owners bankrupt, and its honest, capable workers living shamefacedly on the dole. But even were we ready to admit that nothing short of a new economic dispensation could save the self-respect of the unemployed in the North, we could still find indications of a saving grace in these portraits of the suffering men and women Mr. Hodson knows so intimately.
For those who have read his earlier books, Sam Renshaw, Harriet, Henry Brierley, Trix, the Houghtons are old friends whose later developments are not less interesting, or characteristic, than their adventures in the cotton "" boom."" They are made of first-class human stuff of the true Lancashire quality. They are not sentimentalized, though the temptation to drop into a facile pathos is plain enough here and there, nor are they portraits taken from the very large stock company already familiar to us from Lancashire fiction and drama. And it is the substance of these men and women, but more especially of the older ones, that gives the title a surer justification than Brierley's speculations on the future hope for mankind.
THE- LEMON FARNM. By MARTIN BoyD.
(Dent. 7s. 6d.)
Young Michael Kaye, 23, out of a job, was forced to live with his parents in the little seaside village of Millstead, filling in his time with working for an examination, sailing, and hating most of the inhabitants, from the Barkers who were thick-skinned and kind, to Viola Tait-Mellish who unashamedly pursued him because he was the only man in sight. It was inevitable that when Davina Chelgrove came to live at Seawinds he should fall in love with her, disguising his feelings as long as he could under a schoolboy veneer of roughness and indifference. To him Davina, w.ho had left her husband for a time was a miracle, and she encouraged his adoration, with inevitable results. Their short idyll, of love had to be kept a secret, as badly kept as most secrets are, and before long-there was no one from the coastguards to spiteful Miss Sarah Pinniger who did not know exactly what was going on. A visit from Davina's husband made little difference for better or worse, for the sea played the lovers false, and Michael was left lamenting. Mr. Boyd has shown, us before in' "" Scandal of Spring,"" how kindly he can handle the difficult love of the very young, and Michael is another but older example of his understanding of and' pity for the boy who is struggling to physical and mental manhood.

By James Hodson. London. 7s. 6d. No. Mr. Hodson's title, despite the very tight turn given to it by his material, does not necessarily contain the implication that all is wrong with the world. Lancashire in the twenties was in the grip of a financial crisis and was in danger of becoming a total loss, with its own bankrupt owners and its highly capable workers living shamelessly on the dole. But even if we were ready to admit that nothing short of a new economic dispensation could save the self-respect of the unemployed in the North, we could still find indications of a saving grace in these portraits of the suffering men and women who knew so intimately. For those who have read his earlier books, Sam Roth, Harriet Babbage, Henry Bech, and Trotter, the Hounds are old friends whose later developments are not less interesting, or characteristic, than their adventures in the cotton business. They are made of first-class human stuff of the true Lancashire quality. They are not sensationalized, though the temptation to drop into a phallocrat is plain enough here and there, and they are not taken from the very large stock of characters already familiar to us from Lancashire fiction and drama. And it is the substance of these men and women, but especially of the older ones, that gives the title a more certain justification than the speculations of Mr. Bean on the future of mankind.

This miscellany of novels is like the company in a third-class railway carriage, being as mixed, as variously plcasant or exasperating, and generally as representative as the usual run of chance companions on a journey. The people are, on the whole, a curious lot. Here is a Manchester greengrocer who virtuallv murdered his first wife and does not regret it; beside hirh a young tutor whose imagination betrays him into ihactivity-these two are, though theV are not' aware of it. the extremes that almost cahcel out in Hamletand a veteran of the American Civil War: while opposite are a fatnily in every kind of mental chaos and a'Cockney or two. So much for the general company. Foi once we can follow our fellow-travellers when they separate.
Mr. Tilsley's greengrocer in I'D HATE TO BE DE.&D is the son of another, but his occasional prosperities are earned. not inherited. His adventures begin before he is in his teens and continue through a mnle of fights, business rivalries. ahd almnost unequalled fluctuations of fortune until he is about to go to gaol for his youngest son's embezzlements and discovers that he loves and can depend upon the woman he would not acknowledge as his daughter. It is a lively book and a curiously solid character, a charaCter that does not know the meaning of vacillation. In all his personal encounters, as in his business ones, the man mnakes up his mind for hhiself, and when this is sometimes to his disadvantage he accepts them casually as part of the risk. Greengrocer, tinker, managing director of a chain of shops, coach driver, chauffeur, and labourer, he turns his immense vitality to whatever is profitable at the moment, and not even his real affection for his second wife and his sons can reduce him, unlike many other men, to the size of somebody's husband or somebody else's father.
NIGHTMARE AT THE RACES
That was the man of action. In JOURNEY TO t HE BORDER there is the young man who has done nothing and thought too much, until his thinking is more nearly hallucination and his mind is ill. The sketch plan of the book is simple-no more than an afternoon at the races-but to the tutor it is as though he ttavelled miles in a country alternately expanding and contracting about the white marquee. Self-made m1en, country squires, confident voung Fascists -these are the principal bogeys of a dreadful afternoon. Doubts of everv kind beset the tutor. Fears destroy him. The little uhcertainties that lie in wait for everv intelligent young man alone comlpose his world. and to escape from theml he wanders into the province of in1agination, seeing himscif for a little while at a time as the master of his adversaries, or the successful lover. or the man whose nolitical mind in particular is made up. The character as a human being is invalid, though it may nerhaps be taken as the sum of modern fears. but his adventures are translated by Mr. Upward into an effective dreamiand.
Meanwhile the familv are at home again in the pages of Mr. Brown's THAT STAT E OF tlFE. Old Mrs. Ritchie. the grandihother, is probably the best gauge in which to tell the degree of chaos in which each of her sons and grandchildren is floundcrine. At 76 one can afford to have fixed opinions and oniv castial doubts. and bes;de her. who married. perhaps a little beneath her-in Mrs. Ritchie's dav .hc class distinctions were insisted on-bore several children. and outlived her husband by 20 years. the younger generations seem both pathetic and insipid. Robin is a doctor baffled eoually by cancer and by Chopin. Kenneth1 a windbag uselessly blown un with talk; their marriages are makeshift ; their children are at sea among the claims of polities and the senses. All show the' symptoms of that d:ssatisfaction with the state of lif'e into which th:?v were born that is tvpical of societv today. while to Mrs. Ritchie. that fortunate survivor, everything is as plain as if drawn up to schedule. Out of this chaos Mr. Brown has made a vivacious and sensible story in which his use of the colloquial style altogether justifies itself.
A SOLDIER SICK OF WAR
As for the Civil War veteran, he is of our companv by courtesy. His own adv'entutres in the Amncica of 80 years ago are told in Mr. Hcervev Allen's ACI-o;N Ar AQuILA, and since they concern only on1e small cngagement in the campaign the whole camtpaign perverselv becomes a good deal ciearer than in more ambitious accounts. The book is prefaced for somc reason with a long list of characters. though Mt. Allen is sensible enough to take Us into the confidence of only a few. There are Colonel Franklin, a good soldier bUt sick of the war and especially sick of civilian hatreds; Mrs. Crittendon, who shoLild be his enemy, sinice her husbiand has been killed fighting for the South; her children in hiding with her in a farmhouse in a valley ihat has been overlooked by the armies; and a young boy who goes out to fight with a fervour that has nothing to do with political convictions. Riding back from furlough, the Colonel has plenty of opportunity to take the political temper of various States, and the book is full of short encounters with Northerners of all degrees of enthusiasm, with tSic more slovenly. indolent people on tie Southern border, with "" coltrabahd' negroes, and, in one exciting episode, with a sort of privateers who have set up a "" state "" of their own. The battle scenes towards the end are extraordinarily well written, and indeed most of the writing i.s more thoughtful and fliore economical than one exnects int these lon2 novels
Mr. Ortzeni's Cockneys have so far kent silent, but this is the only respect in which they are lintrue to life. DOWN DONKEY Row deals with another of those villages that still preserve their identity within the gteat bUlk of London. Thc strect of thc title is off the Commercial Road, and niuch of that poor, happy-go-luck v, but oil the whole apparently happy neighbourhood seems to come to life in this little comedy. Street-bettitng, the Ring at Blackfriars, a visit to the ciriema, a walk down Petticoat Laie, a hoheymoon at Southend -with work and an occasional friendlv evening in a sanded publichouse, these are the occupations of Mr. Ortzen'F people, and out of them he has made a very pleasant book.

Here is a Manchester farmer who has killed his first wife and does not regret it, along with a young woman whose imagination betrays him into an activity he does not enjoy.

Toward the End of Time is a book about a man who has done nothing and thought too much, until his thinking is more and more like an illusion and his mind is ill. The plot of the book is simple - no more than an afternoon at the races - but for the tutor it is as though he had traveled in a country, constantly changing its appearance and constructing new memories about the same day. Self-made men, clever country squires, voluntads vociferous - these are the principal worries of a dreadful afternoon. Doubts of every kind beset the tutor. Fears destroy him. The little uncertainties that lie in wait for an intelligent young man alone compose his world. And to escape from them he wanders into the province of imagination, seeing himself as a little while in a time as the master of his adversaries, or the successful lover. or the man whose political mind is in particular made up. The character as a human being is invariably flawed, though it may be taken as the sum of its parts. sum of many modern fears. but his adventures are translated by Mr. Updike into an effective dream. Meanwhile, the family is at home again in the pages of Mr. Brown's STORY OF LIFE. Old Mrs. Ritchie, the grandmother, is probably the best gauge in which to tell the degree of chaos in which each of her sons and grandchildren is fluttering. At 76, one can afford to have fixed opinions and live with occasional doubts. and before her. who married. perhaps a little beneath her - in Mr. Ritchie's day - when class distinctions were insisted upon - had several children. and outlived her husband by 20 years. The younger generations seem both pathetic and insipid. Robin Hood is a doctor who is genuinely befuddled by cancer and by Chopin. Kenneth is a useless brat who gets along with his makeshift marriages and the children he brings home. All this shows the symptom of the dissatisfaction with the state of life in which they were born - a symptom of our tepid society today. While to Mr. Riddle, the feisty survivor, everything is as plain as if drawn up to schedule. Out of this chaos Mr. Brown has made a vivacious and sensual story in which his use of the colloquial style justifies itself. A Soldier of War As for the Civil War veteran, he is our mutual friend. His own adventures in the American Midwest of the 1890s are told in Mr. Hales's A-Z of America, and since then. they concern only a small part of the whole, the perverse side becomes a lot clearer than in more ambitious accounts. The book is framed for some reason with a long list of characters. though Mr. Allen is sufficiently sympathetic to take us into the confidence of only a few. There is a colonel named Franklin, who is a good soldier but shits of the war and especially of civil war hatreds. Mrs. Dickenson, who should be his enemy, should be his wife, who has been killed in the war for the south and her children are in hiding in a farmhouse in a valley that has been overlooked by the army and a young boy who goes out to fight with a ferocious passion that has nothing to do with political convictions. Riding back from the frontier, the colonel has plenty of opportunity to take the political temperament of various States, and the book is full of short encounters with northerners of all degrees of enthusiasm, with some more slovenly indolent people on the southern frontier, with black and white colonists, and, in one exciting episode, with a sort of privateer who has set up a state of its own. The battle scenes toward the end are extraordinary well written, and indeed most of the writing is more thoughtful and less economical than one expects from these long novels by Mr. Ortzenberger. Then came Hitler, and the whole world knew that he was right. that still preserve their identity within the great city of London. The short story of the same name is off the New England coast, and much of that poor, happy-go-lucky stuff seems to have come to life in this little comic. Reading, watching the king at blackfriars, a visit to the circus, a walk down Piazza del Pleasure, a moonlight dinner at Southend-with work and an occasional friendly evening in a salted public house, are the occupations of Mr. Ortzenff, and out of them he has made a very pleasant book.

A PAGAN PHANTASY.
PAN1 AND THE TwINs. By EDms PHILL-
POTTs. (Grant Richards. 7s. 6d. net.)
One night in the time of the Emperor Julian a little Roman slave boy, who has been driven away by his master, lies weeping in the Campagna. To him comes the god Pan-a solemn, sad, rather didactic Pan-heals his bruises, comforts him, tells him who his father is (he is an illegitimate son), and gives him the power to tnderstand the speech of birds and beasts. But this is not a fairy tale any more than "" Rasselas "" is a fairy tale. It is not only Pan who is didactic, but all the characters in the book, even the beasts with whom Arcadius talks.
In her didactic fashion,"" Mr. Phillpotts writes, ""the snake pointed a moral."" HIis own purpose is didactic; his book is a philosophic fantasy; the moral which he himself wishes to point is the beauty of tolerance, and for scene and time he has chosen Rome in the days when the Christian faith is beginning to triumph. Arcadius finds his father, a wealthy patrician, and is received by him with delight. In time he inherits his father's house andwealth; marries a beautiful girl, and one day discovers (as Pan has promised him) his own twin brother. Hilarion also had been a slave; he is now a Christian priest. His desire is to become a hermit, and he finds a cave on Arcadius's estate. But he is young. He falls in love, and Pan is summoned to convince him that he can live in the world and love, and by so doing serve his faith better than in his cave.
Such is the simple story which Mr. Phillpotts uses as a framework for his kindly humorous -discourses. They are didactic, but neither arid nor pompous. It is only occasionally that he lapses into such pretentious commonplaces as ""the static is ever the enemy of the dynamic,"" or ""change is the unalterable and everlasting pronouncement."" Arcadius and Hilarion talk much together, but the chief speeches are from the mouth of Pan, who tAlks on art and love, the future of Christianity, false asceticism, and similar subjects. Mr. Phillpotts practises the tolerance which he preaches. When he is satirical he is never bitter. But his satire is definitely directed against Christianity. His aim is to show, by contrast with it, the virtues of paganism. If he makes fun of one, he makes more than the best of the other. His gentle, moralizing Pan has all the Christian virtues without the faith. He is a god who would adorn any heaven, and his last speech to Arcadius, in which he tells him that the old gods are passing before the dawn of the new belief, but that he himself is of thos6 who "" may loiter as loved ghosts for all time,"" is a beautiful passage.

One night in the time of the Roman emperor Julius, a little Roman slave boy, who has been driven away by his master, lies weeping in the campagna. To him comes the god Pang- a solemn, sad, rather didactic Pang- who heals his bruises, comforts him, tells him who his father is and is an illegitimate son, and gives him the power to understand the speech of birds and beasts. But this is not a fairy tale, any more than Rachel is a fairy story. It is not only Pang who is didactic, but all the characters in the book, even the animals with whom Arcadius talks. In this didactic fashion, Mr. Phillips writes, the snake points a moral. His own purpose is to write a philosophical book about the moral which he himself wishes to point out, in the light of his own experience, the beauty of tolerance, and for this reason he has chosen Rome in the days when the Christian faith is beginning to triumph. Arcadis finds his father, a Roman patrician, and is received by him with great pleasure. In time he will inherit his father's fortune and marry a beautiful girl, and one day he will discover that Pang has promised him his own twin brother. Lilian has also been a slave, and he is now a Christian priest. His desire is to become a hermit, but he does not find a cave in which to live. But he is young. He falls in love, and Pang is summoned to convince him that he can live in the world and love, and, by so doing, serve his faith better than in his cave. Such is the simple story which Mr. Phillpotts uses as a framework for his kindly and humorous discourses. They are not didactic, but they are funny. they are neither sad nor pompous. It is only occasionally that he lapses into such pretentious commonplaces as the static is the enemy of the dynamic, or change is the unavoidable and everlasting punishment. Arcadius and Hilarius talk much together, but the chief speeches are from the mouth of Piazza, who talks of art and love, the future of Christianity, and false asceticism, and similar subjects. Mr. Phillippotts practices the tolerance which he preaches. When he is satirical, he is never bitter. But his satire is definitely directed against Christianity. His aim is to show, by contrast, the virtues of pragmatism. If he makes fun of one, he makes more than the best of the other. His gentle, moralizing Piazza has all the Christian virtues without the faith. He is a god who would adorn any heaven, and his last speech to Aristophanes, in which he tells him that the old gods are dying before the dawn of the new belief, but that he himself is one of those who may live as long as the dead, is a beautiful passage. When one has marked the evident bias of Mr. Phillipps' argument, one does not lessen the enjoyment, the human humanity of his fantasy.",,

The latter half of the book describes their conflict. George.is rich, takes her to lunch at the Savoy and for drives in his car, and wins her company for a weekend. Barty is a journalist; he takes her to lunclh in Soho and discusses with her the economic condition of Germany: but he wins her company. for life. The book closes with the honeymoon. It is a wellwritten and strongly told story, but one cannot help contrasting it with its probable treatment by an American novelist.
The main difference is this. The American would hardly have allowed the conflict to be betwveen two men; he would have made it between one man and the L.M.C.A.

Tao SAXN WrM3W is a notable first novel. Mr. Graham Greene writes with a, distinction and a subtlety that Robert' Louis Stevenson (of whom he is a cousin twice removed) would, we feel sure, have:. applauded., Hemnight have been a little surprised, though, at the method which. Mr. Greene uses for telling bisn stry. It is unusual, when-the theme is the desperate adventures of, a young man fleeing from Sussex smugglers whom heohas--betrayed to the. Revenue officers, to be given auch an elaborate psychologicl analysis of motives, in the most modern style, with-a Freudian. explanation that the hero's faults-he is a coward and a lewd-liver, id spite of his queer charm-are due to the spirit of his cruel ,father torturing~ him withiin. Biut whiether or not we reilish t,hese plunges into the dramatized subconsciou,
we e'annot help being gripped:fast by the trial scene at-Lewes Assizes and its terrible -sequel, or being-attracted.by.the-engmatic, also rather psycho-analytical, Eliabeth, who takes Andrvs, the hero,in!for safety at her lonely cottage and spurs him -to such recovery.of manhood as-is-possible forzhis divided nature. The few descriptions of; the scenery of the-8outh Downs that are interspersed are writteni with the full beauty of Mr. Greene's sensitive style.
Partinoor seems to have fowud a, new novelist-historian- in Mr. L. A. G.I Strong in the 6-cession;froim R. D. Blackimore thrdugh-1Eden' Phillpotts; although the new claimant for the-post does not derive either his style or his methods from earlier writers. This epio of Dick Brendon, seen in three stages-boyhood, early manhood, and old age-follows the modern usage of frank speech. Dick was one of those boys who may follow two paths, but .fate ordained that the grosser side of him should become dominant ; and if we know nothing of his many loves save in the brief retrospect of the third book, we are not sared the coarser details of life among the peasants and small farmers in the Dartmoor of half a century ago. Mr. Strong is a new claimant to literary honours, but he writes already with great force and has a sense of values. DEwEa RrIMs is an unusual first book and one that will compel attention.
On the cover of THE MIDNGHT BELL are the words ""a love story,"" and so simple a description of the book cannot be bettered. It is a story of sacred and profane love, if sacred can be taken to mean love that is idealistic, constant, and Cnerous, andpr6fane love that is selfish, intermittent, and lazy. Bob was a barman (The Midnight Bell was a 'publichouse in one' of London's poorer districts) who read "" The I)ecline and Fall,"" while lenny was a prostitute, and, out of the love between them,Mr. Patrick Hamilton has created 'a large-hearted novel in which pathos and humour jostle each other all the way through. Such a theme is always liable to blunder into sentimentality, but Mr. Hamilton, amusedly detached but by no means unsympathetic, keeps the senti-
mentality inside Bob's own heart and i imagination. For Bob was sentimental, although he had intelligence and personalitv, and to him his love-affair with Jenny was one in spirit with the great romantie loves of the ages. And so, ndeed, -to him it was, but it was his tragedy to cast for the part of heroine a woman too apathetic and degraded to learn her lines. Jenny was not fundamentally heartless, nor was her love for Bob consciously insincere, but it was a feeble love, at the mercy of time and circumstance, and, in learning that dreadful fact, Bob, if he lost his dreams, at any rate found his manhood.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS319365333/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=92eed033,"NOVA HEROES. HISTORY & ROMANCE. Among the new-to-me novels are TH-MAN-WON, by Graham Greene, 7s.6-N-T-E, by Louis XIV-Guillaume, s. 6-8. And TIMES OF DAWN, by Peter Hanema, b. 13-A. And TO WIN a Man is a remarkable first novel. Mr. Greene writes with a distinction, and a subtlety that no other writer, of whom he is a cousin twice removed, would have approved. He might have been a little surprised, though, at the method by which he used his diction. It is unusual, when the subject is the desperate adventures of a young man, fleeing from the smuggling lords whom he has betrayed to the Revenue Officers, to be given also an elaborate psychological analysis of his motives, in the most modern style, with a French explanation. That the hero's faults - being a coward and a liar, in spite of his lovely charm - are due to the infidelities of his cruel father, torturing him with it. But whether or not we enjoy this plume, which plunges into the sub-conscious, we cannot help but be gripped by the tragic scenes at Leeds-on-Sea, and its terrible sequel, or being - attracted to - the more imaginative, rather than psycho-analytical, Eileen, who takes Agamemnon, the hero, for safety in her lonely cottage and spurs him on to such a recovery of manhood as is possible for his divided nature. The few descriptions of the scenery of the North Downs that are interspersed with the more sensitively written scenes, are all written with the full beauty of Mr. Green's sensitive style. Peter Paul seems to have foreseen a new novelist, a historical figure - in Mr. A. G. Wells, 6th cent. from R. D. Blake--though the new claimant for the post does not derive either his style or his methods from earlier writers. This episode of Dick Bech, seen in three stages follows the modern usage of the word 'frank'. Dick was one of those boys who may follow two paths, but his fate ordained that the grosser side of him should become dominant and if we know nothing of his many loves save in the brief prospect of his third book, we are not aware of the coarser details of life among the peasants and small farmers in the rural parts of England half a century ago. Mr. Smith is a newcomer to literary fame, but he already writes with great force and has a sense of humour. Toward the End of Time is an unusual first book and one that will compel attention. On the cover of the 'The Midnight Bell' is a love story, and such a simple description of the book cannot be better. It is a story of sacred and public love, and if that love can be taken to mean love that is idealistic, constant, and relentless, it is also love that is selfish, intermittent, and lazy. Bob was a barman at The Midnight Bell was a public house in one of London's poorer districts who read The Innocence and Fall, while Lizzie was a prostitute, and, out of the love between them, Mr. Patrick Hamilton has created a large-hearted novel in which pathos and humour jostle each other all the way through. Such a theme is always liable to bludgeon into sentimentality, but Mr. Hamilton, amusingly detached but not by any means unsympathetic, keeps the sensual mentality inside his own heart and imagination. For Bob was selfish, although he had an intelligence and personality, and to love Lizzie was selfish. integrity, and for him his love-affair with Jenny was one in the company of the great romantic loves of the ages. And so, indeed, it was - but it was his tragedy to cast for the part of the heroine a woman too apathetic and degraded to learn her lines.

MISS DE LA ROCHE AND

YOUNG RENNY. By MAzo DE LA ROCHE.
(Macmillan. 7s. 6d.)
That well-known Ontario family, the Whiteoaks, are much indebted to Miss Mazo de la Roche, their very sympathetic biographer, who knows their foibles but refuses to exaggerate them and has a wholesome respect and admiration for their virtues and their position. She takes us back to the year 1908 and shows us Jalna in high summer, the house full of the family including the English Buckleys and a cousin from Ireland, male, sinister, and calculating, called Malahide Court. Renny, some day to be the master of Jalna. is not yet 20, a very charming young man beginning to cxperiment with thoroughbred horses and women of less pure blood. The family life is depicted with knowledge of character and a pleasant sense of spacious country surrounding thc fortunate Whiteoaks, who have the niind and thc materials for getting a great deal out of existence. The loyalty of Philip to his son, Renny, and of the other memnbers of the family to each other in times of crisis is tested by various plots and misadventures but as ever it holds fast. The old Mrs. Whiteoak, a vivacious 80, holds the reins in her hands and knows pretty acutely what is passing behind locked doors and in hidden hearts, but she uses her knowledge with justice and generosity when it comes to be. a nmatter of upholding the family honour against outside criticism.
Nothing very, important happens, but the action is livelv and Jalna in 1908 is tvrapped in happiness and peace, in spite of Mleg's damaged heart and the machinations of Malahide. Renny and his small stepbrothers are genuinely young and ardent.

A-mong new novels are TBio, by Phlyllis Bentley (Gollanez, 7s. 6d. net), ark A NOTE IN' Music, by Rosainond Lelmann! (Cliatto and Windus, 7s. 6d. net).
The story of three young wvomen in Yorkshire-Rachel, Lena, and Esm6connected by ties of blood and destined to be inextricably tlhrown together by mariiage and crossed love aftairs, gives Mliss Phyllis Bentley scope for the exercise of her gifts of leisurely characterdrawing and careful presentation. TRIo has a W7est Riding backgrounlld, and MIiss Bentley knowvs the shrewvd and sturdy
type of business muau, honest, sensual, I alimost gross,as well as the more subtle variations of the male species; she makes
I{owvg;3te and the Delle.rs vrery nearly asI symrwiathletie to thle reader as-tlie Averys,; father and son, and the attractiv-e if wveak Arunold. The girls tnd Mrs. Avery and the minor characte.rs, shoolmistress and servants, are quite as lifelike. Lena, Howgate's illegitimate and adopted daughter, is the odd man-out; an-unhappy small girl when we first meet her, unable to hold her own -in school life, adoring the cahl
vRachel and bullied by Esm6, with wvhom she is fated to have an incurable quarrel. Lena&s development from the awkward misery of her ill-dressed provincial youth into a charminlg young womnan of poise anid character is naturally and wvell shown. The other girls belong to types that tre comlplete in infancy; Rachel serene and courageous aind fair, 13sm selfish to the core, shallowv and vain. The ta-le depends for its interest less on events than on the interplay of eharacter in very ordinary conditions. Mliss Bentley is a thorougi and conscientious writer wlho leaves no looso ends.

The story of three young women in Yorkshire - Rachael, Lena, and Estelle - connected by ties of blood and destined to be intertwined inextricably by marriage and love after death, gives Miss Phyllis Bentley scope for the exercise of her gifts of leisurely character drawing and careful presentation. The Rio Grande has a rough and ready reputation, and Miss Bentley knows the shrewd and sturdy type of business woman, hard, sensual, and almost brutish, as well as the more subtle variations of the female species that make her attractive to the reader as much as a vampire or a werewolf. The girls and Mr. Avery and the other minor characters, such as school mistresses and servants, are all quite lifelike. Lena is the ill-fated daughter of a rich family and the unhappily married father of three children. Her development from the awkwardness and misogyny of her early school life into a mature woman of promise and personality is shown to be natural and well shown. The other girls belong to the complete typography of Rachel, serene and cheerful in her infancy and fair and selfish in her old age and vain in her youth. The tale depends for its interest on events rather than on the interplay of characters in very ordinary circumstances. Miss Bentley is a talented and conscientious writer who leaves no room for errors. Rosalind Lehman's novel, A Note to Me, is an episodic, impressionistic account of the effect that a beautiful and decorative brother and sister have on their respective daughters. rather dreadful married couples whose paths cross shortly. Character is the thing that Miss Lehman can convey with ease and economy. Tom Fairfax and Gloria Fairfax are as definite as pale-faced vampires, and Norah and Gerald are as real as rabbits, and Henry and Clare are excellently coloured photographs. There is a light, careless grace in the way seasons and interiors, gardens and human exteriors, are described, and a carelessness that is surprising and recurrent in much of the writing. His reflections about her dead child and her dead puppy leave the reader bewildered as to what was. Which, in turn, teaches the writer to express clearly what she has not thought out clearly. There is an unmistakable snobbishness in every one of the slightly depressed figures in this book, and the atmosphere of futility is more depressing than it is. It would not be possible for the writer to convey the utterly robust truths of his own experience, the mingled cruelty and tenderness that underlie the situation and the story.",,

It could not have been Lawrence's habit to polish. His wvork was a vehemiient outpouring; it might be described as a storm of thunder and lightning.

The theme is not' new, but a variation of one Lawrence often treated. An old stoI-y of a white wvoman's desire for an Indianl has its counterpart in this story of. an. eciicated girl, brought up in the slllUg meallncss of a bickering household, allowing her. adolescent msind wlhat freedori of escape there may be in pltying round the figure of a handsome and inisolent gypsy. It is not a theme to excite new interest, but Lawrence holds attention by the setting and the skilful characterization. The respectable family in the rectory, with their tyrannies and hatreds and futile protests, are wonderfully drawn and strike a clhill in the heart. The -wintry landscape matches the mood; and there is magnificence and awve in Lawrence's picture when the reservoir bursts and the relentless flood swirls across the village, destroying-and cleansing.
A swiftly moving piece of work, Miss Mary Borden's new novel takes the dazzled reader round and round the world and into the most varied society. But it is alWays Society, with money to spend and a great need for amusement and clhange. Change of cli-miate, change. of lhouse, change of husband and lover, the slmlall change of fashionable chatter, eveni ehange of habits and personality, and in Caroline Merryweathler's final phase something amounting to a change of heart.

Tawaska is a new versionor vision-of the heroic brute.

But the reader need niot be deterred 'by her disillusionment; she had too great possessions perhaps.

It lacks, we are told, the author's final revision, but no reader will detect a deficiency. It could not have been his habit to write. His work is a vigorous and vigorous outpouring of energy that might be described as a storm of thunder and lightning. His last novel is a characteristic blend of thought and style. If he were alive when he wrote it, no weakening of power would show, indeed, more than a suggestion of some serious mystery about himself if not of his subject. The subject is not new, but a variant of one which Lawrence has often treated. An old story of a woman's desire to have an Indian wife has its counterpart in this story of an excited girl. brought up in the squalor of a bitchbugging family, she allows her adolescent mind to wander as far as she can before plumping up for the role of a handsome and insolent gypsies. It is not a new subject, but it is a variation of one which has long been treated. An older sister tells us that her husband's impotence is due to a lack of self-control. The respectable family in the country, with its tyrannical and hateful husband, has its own problems. The wintry landscape matches the mood and there is a wonderful deal of beauty in the landscape when the reservoir bursts and the relentless rain swirls across the village, destroying and cleansing.

She is the woman whose eyes are said to be blind in regard to everything that affects her emotionally, and exactly what that means to the hopeful reader must ponder. She is an American of the cosmopolitan class who lives mainly in England, and after an English lover acquires an English husband. She designs to tell the story of her close friend Maggie Buchanan, another American woman married to an Englishman in this country, but as is the way with these records of blunders, she manages to reveal more of herself than Lady Buchanan does. But the facts of their lives do not get set. somehow, and the process of evection that passes before the reader is sufficiently credible, although one must accept Waksha, the narcissistic Finn, as a little more than mortal. Kawasaki is a new version of the heroic brute. A violent, regressive demon moves through the book in his wake, and Caroline is a pessimist convinced of the futility of life and of its cruelty. But the reader need not be deterred by the impression that she has had too great a possession.

A Russian's
Boris Akunin is a sensation. He has created a popular hero to equal Sherlock Holmes and James Bond in his bestselling whodunnits. Giles Whittell met him
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO the Ukrainian mafia, broadly defined, paid Boris Akunin an elaborate compliment. It produced a book bearing his name. He didn't write a word of it, but someone did, by all accounts extremely badly. It has sold a few thousand copies and put Akunin in illustrious company: the Kievan mqb is also doing a brisk trade in something called The Last Merovingian, ""by"" Dan (da Vinci) Brown. Akunin relates this story indulgently, as well he might. Any damage being done to his reputation by Ukrainian conmeri will be easily outweighed by the English publication of The Death of Achilles, the fourth translated Volume in a series starring a foppish but tungsten-tipped tsarist detective who has already made Akunin rich, envied, happy and free to roam the real world in as much style as he used to roam the literary one. For those who haven't heard of this prodigiously productive pioneer of period post-Soviet crime fiction, a little background: he wrote his first novel, in six weeks flat, in 1998. He has since produced ten more in one series, four in two others and three in a fourth, the latter all written on a three-month P&O cruise last year, He writes in a blur of speed: two hours a day, after which he reckons to have ten typewritten pages ready for his publisher. He then reads (strictly nonfiction), drinks with friends and plays computer games. Akunin's finest creation and the star of his first 11 titles is Erast Fandoriri — genius, gentleman, polyglot, kickboxer and all-round inordinately lucky bloke. In Russia, three Fahdorin books have been made into films so far and two of them into television series as well. Outside Russia, Fandorin is coming sooner or later to a screen near you; Paul Verhoeven, who directed the notorious Basic Instinct, has the rights. Whatever you make of his writing, Akunin (real name: Grigory Chkartashvili) is a phenomenon; the only Russian writer to reach a mass audience abroad as well as domestically since the Soviet collapse. Each of his three titles already out in English (The Winter Queen Murder on the Leviathan and Turkish Gambit) has sold more than 50,000 copies in the UK alone In Russia, meanwhile, he has shifted more than 10 million books in seven years, and his success there says much about his perspicacity but even more about his country. It was all minutely planned on a premise that the new Russia has produced a new type of Russian who craves a hew type of reading. That's the perspicacity bit. And then the premise turned out to be correct. The middle class emerging from perestroika and the Yeltsin mess had Tolstoy and Dostoevsky on the one hand and pulp fiction on the other, but nothing in between. ""In Russia nowadays the middle class is the revolutionary class,"" Akuniyi says. ""It did not exist before It's very energetic very active arid
in need of everything a class needs, like ideology, ethics, aesthetics and, well, easy reading."" He's 49, married without kids, and looks in profile like a slimline, youthful Alfred Hitchcock. He talks quietly, with the fluency and concision of someone who's had time to organise what's in his head. We meet not in Moscow, where he lives, but in London, where he has been driven nuts all morning by a demolition crew bringing down an office block next to his corporate apartmerit near St Paul's. He peers round a blind and mutters that he ""never thought British workmen could be so industrious"". Not that he has any such illusions about his fellow writers. Not any more. When he identified the gap in the Russian book market that he has since filled, it was the mid-1990s. He wasan intellectual, supplementing a laughable wage as a literary editor by translating foreign fiction into Russian at ten pages an hour. Loath to sully his own keyboard with the breathless whodunnits he had in mind, he asked his mates to give them a try. ""They were talented writers, poets, critics, and at first I simply wanted to organise them to write this sort of fiction... But these Russian writers, they are so lazy."" So he offered to construct their plots for them. Still nb takers. ""After a while I'd had enough and decided to set an example, to write
^HeVnot very sure of himself, he doesnft always win*.
just one novel in the style that I mean, and that is how the first one appeared."" Russia has plenty of crime and crime writers, but no one had come up with anything like the Holmes-Bond^Oblonsky mix that is Fandorin. Akunin thinks this is because his creation embodies so much that modern Russians aren't. He's ""understated, dignified, reserved"". He's also the straight-up action hero whom Akunin never found in his own voracious reading of the Russian classics as a boy, unable to pick the wrong pistol in a dud arid so spiffing at martial arts (picked up on a six-year attachment to the Russian Embassy in Tokyo from which he returns at the beginning of The Death of Achilles) that he can do back-flips off the ceiling and whack you in the back of the neck on his way down. Yet Fandorin is still Russian, ""He is not very sure of himself. He's reflective. He doesn't always win, and when he does, sometimes he regrets it. This is one of the features typical of the Russian intelligentsia that I find attractive."" Fandorin's fey look is that of a scion of the von Meek family that befriended Tchaikovsky and built railways for Alexander II. Akunin picked up his portrait in a Moscow flea market.
Russian, un-Russian, whatever. Fandorin caught on, riot just because of who he is but when he operated. No one has revived the tsarist twilight with quite Akunin's energy and affection, which he insists is less for the period than the novels it produced. His books are adazzle with grandeur and grotesqueries borrowed joyfully from the greats, which most of his Russian readers know almost as well as he does. This saves space, he says, not joking. ""I just have to draw a few [word] pictures"" — of a befurred aristo pulling up outside a snowbound restaurant in the manner of Prince Oblonsky, say — ""and my reader knows exactly what sort of person this is. I don't have to spend pages and pages describing his or her life story."" It also transports the reader to a unique time between absolutism and the Soviet ice age when Russia was a place of wild schemes and optimism, not just those vast impersonal forces leading to 1917. A smart move simply from the point of view of reader morale, one would have thought. But Akunin also argues that his country was wrestling then with many of the issues that confront it now. It's a serious point and he offers an example in Dostoevksy's clairvoyant passages on modern political terrorism in The Devils. Not long ago, this might have been an attempt by Akunin to suggest some important purpose behind his new life as a bestseller writer. Not now, though. He is unembarrassed and delighted by his success. And somewhat reconciled to having spent the first half of his life trapped in the Soviet Union. ""When I was young I felt very sorry for myself that I was born in this awful, boring country,"" he muses. ""Now I think of this rather as a bonus, because growing up in a country like that stimulated your brain. You had to distance yourself from what was surrounding you, and besides, when you live in a quiet country you might live to the end of your life without really understanding what sort of person you are."" Ouch? It gets worse. In the West, says the sage from the country with an average male life expectancy of 57, people live till they die of Alzheimer's at 95 ""because their heart is strong and they have watched their cholesterol all their life without life ever really testing them"". Akunin has some experience of Western gerontocracy. The three volumes he knocked off last year, comprising a mini-series he has called Tiie Genres, sparked accusations in Russian papers that he was getting ""literary slaves"" (his own phrase) to do some of his work. Not true, he says. He wrote them all in a cabin on Deck 11 of the Aurora cruise liner on a roundthe-world tour from Southampton to Southampton, ""The average age of the passengers was about 85,'? he says, ""and it was an incredibly boring experience. It was the perfect setting for tik""

The Kievan MB is also doing a brisk trade in something called The Last Merovingian, by Daniel Bohlen. Akunin relates this story in an engaging way, as well as he might. Any damage being done to his reputation by the Ukrainian civil war will be easily outweighed by the English publication of The Death of Agamemnon, the fourth volume in a series starring a ferocious but tungsten-tipped tiger detective who has already made him rich, envied, and happy to roam the real world in as much style as he used to roam the literary one. For those who haven't heard of this prodigious producer of post-Soviet crime fiction, a little background information he wrote his first novel, in six weeks flat, in 1998. He has since produced ten more novels in one series, four in two others and three in a fourth, the latter all written on a three-month cruise on the PBS last year, He writes in a blur of speed two hours a day, after which he reckons to have written ten typewritten pages ready for his publisher. He then reads strictly non-fiction, drinks with friends and plays computer games. His best creation and the star of his first eleven novels is Erastus Fandor, a brilliant scientist, philanderer, poet, and kickboxer who is also an inordinately lucky boy. In Russia, three of the four books have been made. Fandor's books have been made into film and two of them into television series as well. Outside Russia, Fandor is coming sooner or later to a screen near you, and Paul Verhoeven, who directed the notoriously bad Basic Instinct, has the rights. Whether you make or make not of this writing, the real name of Grigory Chkartashvili is the only Russian writer to reach a mass audience abroad as well as domestically since the Soviet collapse. Each of his three books, already out in English, The Woman Who Married the Rabbit and The Persian Gaze, has sold more than 50,000 copies in the UK alone, and in Russia, meanwhile, he has shifted more than 10 million books in seven years, and his success there says much about his perspicacity but even more about his country. It was all planned from the very start, based on the premise that the new Russia has produced a new type of Russian who craves a certain type of reading. That's the perceptual bit. And then the premise turned out to be correct. The middle class that emerges from the postwar period and the postwar Yeltsin machinations had Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky on the one hand and Stalin on the other, but nothing in between. In Russia today, the middle class is the revolutionary class, says Akinyev. It did not exist before and is very active and needs everything a class needs, like ideology, ethics, aesthetics and, well, easy reading. He's 49, married to a woman, and looks in profile like a slimline, young Alfred Hitchcock. He talks quietly, fluency and clarity of someone who has had time to organise what is in his head. We meet not in Moscow, where he lives, but in London, where a demolition team has been working all morning to bring down an office block next to his apartment building near Saint Paul. He peering over the window, he makes a point that he never thought British workers could be so industrious. Not that he has any such illusions about his fellow writers. Not anymore. When he identified the gap in the Russian book market that he had filled, it was the mid-1990s. He was an intellectual, supplementing a laughable wage as a literary editor by translating foreign fiction into Russian at ten pages an hour. Lolking to sully his own keyboard with the breathless horrors he had in mind, he asked his mates to give him a try. They were talented writers, poets, and critics, and at first I simply wanted to organisze them into this sort of fiction... But these Russian writers, they are so lazy. So he offered to construct their plots for them. Still no sign. After a while I had enough and decided to set an example, to write without being very sure of himself, he didn't always win. Just one novel in the style that I meant, and that is how the first one appeared. Russia has plenty of crime writers, but no one has come up with anything like the Holmes-Boltzky mix that is. is Fandorin. Akunin thinks this is because his creation embodies so much that modern Russians are not. He's understated, dignified, reserved. He is also the straight-up action hero whom Kaunin never found in his voracious reading of the Russian classics as a boy, unable to pick the wrong punch in a duel and so spiffing at martial arts that he picked up on a six-year attachment to the Russian Embassy in Tokyo from which he returned at the beginning of The Death of Aristophanes that he can do back-flips off the ceiling and whack you in the back of the neck on his way down. Yet he is still Russian, and he does not feel very sure of himself. He is reflective. He does not always win, and when he does, he sometimes regrets it. This is one of the typical features of the Russian intelligentsia that I find attractive. His father is a member of the Von Mises family that befriended Tchaikovsky and built railways for Alexander II. Kaunin picked up his portrait in a Moscow flea market. Russian, un-Russian, whatever. Andorra is not afraid to riot, not because of who he is but because of what he does. No one has revivified the tragic twilight with such unerring energy and affection, which he insists is less for the period than the novels it produced. His books are adazzled with grandeur and gorgeously grotesque descriptions, taken from the great works of art that most of his Russian readers know as well as I do. This saves space, he says, not joking. space, he says, not joking. I just have to draw a few word pictures of a befuddled aristophanes pulling up outside a snowbound restaurant in the manner of Prince Obolonsky, and my reader knows exactly what sort of person this is. I don't have to spend pages and pages describing his or her life story. It also transports the reader to a unique time between absolutism and the soviet era when Russia was a place of wild and spontaneous optimism, not just those vast, impersonal forces that led to 1917. A smart move simply from the point of view of the reader, one would have thought. But Akunin also argues that his country was then struggling with many of the issues that faced it now. It's a serious point and he offers an example in his clairvoyant passages on modern political terrorism in The Devils. Not long ago, this might have been an attempt by Akunin to suggest some important purpose behind his new life as a novelist. Not now, though. He is unaffected and delighted by his success. And somewhat reconciled to having spent the first half of his life trapped in the Soviet Union. When I was young, I felt very sorry for myself that I was born in this awful, boring country, he said. Now I think of this as a benefit, because growing up in a country like that stimulates your brain. You had to distance yourself from what was surrounding you, and, besides, when you live in Russia. in a tiny country you might live to the end of your life without really understanding what sort of person you are. Ouch? It gets worse. In the west, says the passage from the country with an average male life expectancy of 57, people live until they die of cancer at 95 because their heart is strong and they have watched their cholesterol levels all their life without ever really testing them. Akunin has some experience of Western gerontocracy. The three volumes he knocked off last year, comprising a mini-series he has called 'Twenty Centimetres,' sparked accusations in Russian newspapers that he was getting literary slaves on his own to do some of his work. Not true, says he. He wrote them all in a cabin on the 11th floor of an Aurora cruise ship on a round-the-world tour from Southampton to Southampton, the average age of the passengers was about 85, and he says, ""It was an incredibly boring experience. It was the perfect setting for this novel. See critical review, page 22.",,

COUNTRY STUDIES
Among new novels are THE JE.ALoUs GHOST, by L. A. G. Strong (Gollancz, 7s. 6d. net); MLvY CAPTIVES, by John Owen (Gollanez, 7s. 6d. net); and HEn FA'Tmn's HousE, by Hilda- Vaughan (Heinemann, 7s. 6d. net).
In his second novel, THE JEALous GHosr, Mr. Strong has moved his scene from Dartmoor to the coast of Inverness, a change that is of an importance beyond that implied by a mere slhift of backgrounid. In another setting hiis story, which is of the simplest, might have been a little flat, even in some respects blankly unconvincing; but in any country in which the Gaelic tongue still lingers we can accept a ghost without a quibble. Not that MIr. Strong, having advertised its presence in his title, does very much with the jealous eighteenth-century wvraith who appears in such visible and audible form to John Stewart when he returns to the land of his fathers after more than thirty years' residence in America. We are left, indeed, with the feeling that,' having planned his book, Mr. Strong with his keen sense of character and feeling for the interchanges of modern life was something diverted from his original intention by his interest in such vital, substantial people as the Gordons, mother and son, the McKays, the seventeen-year-old Peter, and the very small twins. But what really matters is not that Mlr. Strong should attempt some less hackneyed combination of one of the familiar plots, but that he should have given us a picturo of a-fragment of life, against a-lovely background of mountain, rocks, and sea, which his rare gifts of description will revive for those who know them and, more powerful achlievement, create for those who do not.
Mr. Owen's tenderness for life has found a sympathetic form of expression in MINY CAITIvEs. He has looked upon Creation and seen,. sympathetically but without sentimentalism, the chains that bind, it. Chief among his captives is Edward Crossford, wNho had come, thoughtlessly rather than criminally, within reach of the law and had had his spirit cramped and subdued by prison life. Another victim of circumstance is Gil Soutliwaite, the labourer, whose War legacy was a steadily advancing deafness, a handicap that loses him the affection of Lenn Voss, who in her turn falls a victim to ber marriage with Tom Stone. The last-named is, also, a captive, but the chains in this case are of his own forging, since he allows, even encoturages, his passion for money to rule his destiny. Beyond these there are those, such as. Maitland and .Mrs. Freor, who are superbly unaware of the prison of convention that confines' their spirits. But whether one should include the passionate child Faith Crossford in the same category is a more difficult question, since her chief mission in this book is the liberation of the caged blackbird, whose story imbues the opening with a faint air of allegory. All these people and somne others Mr. Owen watclies and describes for us moving withiin the little-orbit of a country village. He does not descend to. any forced sympathy, nor demand of his readers any aspect of partisanship. But he. engages our interest by the simple verisimilitude of his method, and holds it by the direct development of his characters' various histories.
Mfiss Vaughan has again chosen the Welsh countryside a generation or two ago as the scene of her novel, HER-FATBEB'S HOUSE-or at least of half of it. It,is by far the better half. The daughter of a hard-living Radnorshire squire and- a woman of lesser birth, Nell Tretower had been taken away as a child fiom her father's house by her mother, whose somewhat joyless temperament had been embittered by an unhappy marriage. While living with her mother and younger sister in the house of her uncle Mark (a very effective portrait of Welsh peasant character) Nell was thrown by chance into contact with her father, still a fierce, wilful character, but gradually declining into arrogant recklessness. Her subsequent meetings wvitlh him were kept secret from her mother, whose jealous fury on learning of them provided the -girl wvith an opportunity of going to London. There Nell -is employed as a- general servant in a genteel house and abandons domestic service for marriage when Evan Harris, who had- courted her in Wales, reappears on the scene. They set up house in a room somewhere in Whitechapel ahd struggle with poverty. A baby is born nnd soon dies; Evan loses his job; and Nell, about to become a mother again, dreams of returning to her father's house before the event. The second part of the nover 'is much, less balanced and carries much less conviction than the earlier part, which keeps a firm grasp on racial character and sentiment.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS369566391/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=3da9a5e9,"INDIAN BOOKS IN STOCK Among the new novels are The Jealousy of the High Life, by Louis XIV. Gollancz, 7s. 6d. ; MARY CAPTIVES, by John O. Gallantz, 6s. 7d.; and The Housmans of England, by Henry V. Heinemann, 7st. 6d, n.p. In his second novel, THE JEALOUSY OF HOURS, Mr. Strong has moved his scene from the moors of Dartmoor to the coast of Inverness, a change that is of an importance beyond that indicated by a mere shift of background.

Mr. Owen's tenderness for life has found a sympathetic form of expression. has looked upon creation and seen, sympathetically but without sentimentalism, the chains that bind it. Chief among his captives is Edward Cross, who has come, though unthinkably, within the reach of the law and has had his peace and tranquillity reduced to a squall. Another victim of circumstance is Gil Soutliwaite, the labourer, whose War legacy is a steadily advancing deafness, a handicap that loses him the affection of Lenny Voss, who in turn falls in love with Tom Stone. The last-named man is also a captive, but the chains in this case are his own, and his freedom from guilt is no longer a question of whether he should live or die. But whether one should include the passionate child of Francesca in the same category is a more difficult question, since her chief mission in this book is the liberation of the trapped blackbird, whose story imbues the opening with a faint air of allegory. All these people and some others whom Mr. Owen describes as moving with him within the little-known orbit of a country village. He does not demand any form of sympathy from his readers, nor does he demand any aspect of political commitment from his readers.

Miss. his characters' personalities. Miss Vaughan has again chosen the Welsh countryside a generation or two ago as the setting for her novel, HER-BABES-HOUSE--or at least part of it. It is, by far, the best of the two. The daughter of a hard-working Rotherham squire and a woman of less than thirty-years-old, Nell Turnbull had been taken away as a child from her father's house by her mother, whose somewhat joyless temperament had been embittered by an unhappy marriage. While living with her mother and younger sister in the house of her uncle, Mark, a very effective portrait of a young Welsh poet, was thrown into contact with her father, still a fierce, wilful character, but gradually deteriorating into a more erudite and adventurous person. Her subsequent meetings with him were kept secret from her mother, who was furious at learning of them and provided the girl with an opportunity to go to London. There is no need to describe him, for he is a general servant in a genteel house and abandons his domestic service for marriage when Evan Harris, who had courted her in Wales, appears on the scene. They set up shop in a room in a house somewhere in London and struggled with poverty. A baby is born and soon dies, and Evan loses his job and goes abroad.

MR. GALSWORTHY ON' TIIE
GENIUS OF DICKENS.
Ir. .JTOIL GMLswowIny, the novelist, delivered an address yesterday at the Indian Students' Union and Ihostel, Keppelstreet, W.C., on ""*Three Great Novelists, and Some Personal Reflections on the Novel."" The ntovelists were Charles Dickers, the Englishman ; Ivan Turgenev. the Ruissian; and Guy de 'Maupassant, the Frenchman. To him beyond dispute, said Mr. GALS,wonTam, Dickens was the greatest English novelist ; and the greatest example in the annals of all novel-wvriting of the triumph of sheer exuberant genius. lIe had no culture, no art, and yet by native imagination and force of expression he had left humani nature imprinted on men's minds more variously and vividlv than anv other WVestern novelist. Though Turgenev had been surpassed in scone by Dickens, by Tolstoi, perhaps by others, the poetic art of his niovels was tuniequlalled so far by any other novelist. MWith de Malpassant we reached tle apex-the very. top of the shaped novel and story ; the highest mark of fiction. wlhich knew exactly wvhat it was about- and had for aini reve!ation of the strange depths and shallows of human nature. 'io him, the temperament of de Maupassant was clearly visible in his work ; but it was never directlv shown.
We were all just now struggling, continiued Mr. Galsworthy, in the floods of an cxperimental period ; and there wvere even signs already of a reaction towards something more modern than modernism. Personally he was for experiment just so long and so far as it attempted sincerely to create the live thing. Real creation needed a sympathetic brooding ovei ideas, circumstance, and character; a deeppenetration into human mindsand nattre, aiid inito the nioods of nature. No good end was served by throwving over recklessly and callously the efforts and aclievements of the past; nor by plunging into ink before the plunger had bathed in life. and stored within himself feelings and experienice.
There was too much of trying to make sometliing out of nothing. No good to Art came out of tle cleverness of cliQues and coteries for ever destroying the past; and tallking of how, not to do it in the present.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS119608049/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=b265b85f,"NOVAK YOGY. MR. GLOSSY OVER TIETH GENIUS OF DICKENS. II. TOIL. John Updike, the novelist, delivered an address yesterday at the Indian Students' Union and Hostel, Keppel, W.C., on Three Great Novelists, and Some Personal Recollections on the New. The novelists were Charles Dick, the Englishman, Ivan Turgenev, the Russian and Henry Bech, the Frenchman. To him, beyond doubt, was Dickens the greatest English novelist and the greatest example in the history of all novel-writing of the triumph of sheer extraordinary genius. He had no culture, no art, and yet by his natural imagination and force of expression he had left behind the most beautiful and complex emotions in the world. Though sometimes surpassed by Dick, by Tolstoy, or perhaps by others, the poetic art of his novels was never quite equalled by any other novelist. With de Miserables we reach the apex of the novel's shape and the highest point of fiction. which knew exactly what it was about - and had an intoxicating fascination with the strange depths and sharp edges of human nature. In him, the temperament of the novelist was clearly visible in his work but not in his personality. We are all just now struggling, Mr. Galsworthy, in the waning stages of an experimental period and there are already signs of a turning away from something more modern than modernism. His personality was just an experiment, a way of attempting to create something new. Real creation needs a sympathetic brooding over ideas, circumstances, and characters, and a deep penetration into the mind and soul, into the mysteries of nature. No good end is served by throwing away recklessly and carelessly the efforts and achievements of the past. past nor by plunging into ink before the plunger has bathed in life. and stored up in himself feelings and experiences. There was a lot of trying to make something out of nothing. No good artist comes out of the cleverness of his characters or the ways in which he thinks or feels, not from doing it in the present.",,

MR. THORNTON WILDER AND
MISS ERTZ
HEAVEN'S MY DESTINATION. ByTHCRNTON
WILDER. (Longmans. 7s. 6d. net.)
Mr. Wilder has taken a leaf out of Cervantes and imagined a Don Quixote in the shape of a young American traveller in school books, aged 23, who has "" got religion "" and possesses a mind impervious to argument, an unconquerable determination to live up to his principles, and an absolute lack of humour. This lively and often very amusing novel, moving from scene to scene on George Brush's business round, shows us typical instances of the contact between his profound simplicity and the worldliness of others. Thrice does Brush land in jail and once in hospital-this last because his own cronies were so irritated at his unshakeable simplicity that they pounded and stamped on him. Mr. Wilder is happy in his choice of episodes to show that to such a man as Brush the whole world must seem mad, as he to the whole world. The day and niglht at a holiday camp, the day at Kansas City when Brush, proud of his tenor voice, is tricked into solemnly lunching with the Madame Tellier of the district and her wards, believing them to be a true American family, and taking the girls to the movies, and the affair at Ozarksville, with its dialogue in court between Brush and the wise old Judgeall are admirable as pieces of humorous narrative. But the obvious criticism is that Brush, unlike his prototype, seems to have no tragic significance. He is not everyman, he is not even the pure fool at the end, but apparently only a bit of the intense seriousness of young America, which is, we suppose, only happy and healthy when serving some kind of selfimposed code. The philosophic direction of this tale is somewhat wavering, but it makes good reading none the less.
Now WE SET OuT. By SUSAN ERTZ.
(Hodder and Stoughton. 7s. 6d. net.)
The first six months of marriage present many problems, happily for novel writers, and now Miss Susan Ertz has investigated some of them and shown us in an interesting and skilful way why Stephen Perryn and Lita Glendenning wrangled so bitterly, doubted each other, separated, and agreed to try again to live together in harmony. They were a nervous and touchy pairill-tempered would hardly be too strong a word-and each had family ties. Lita owned a badly made-up mother and a Portuguese stepfather who presently deserted her. Stephen was recalled from his honeymoon because his married sister and his parents had incurred separate tragedies. Added to these complications each knew and resented the other's past and private life. Lita had less to grieve over, because Stephen's attachment to Mary von Stiebel had been mainly based on kindness to an older and unhappy woman; but Stephen knew that Lita had loved and meant to marry, had he not unexpectedly died, Charles Fosdick, with whom she had lived for some time. He had left her £300 a year, and on this rock their lives split asunder.
How Stephen ordered Lita to get rid of this money and she disposed of it is very good comedy carefully handled by Miss Ertz so as to make the most of it. Indeed, it is some time since she has written so good a book, consistently interesting us in her stormy pair and finding an ingenious reason for putting Lita splendidly in the right when Stephen comes to make a last attack and discovers that he must capitulate without reserve. It is almost certain that the Perryns will go on wrangling and bickering to the end of the chapter, but possibly Charles Fosdick's ghost is laid and something of Stephen's uneasy jealousy with it. Certainly Miss Ertz believes in firmly- clearing away families from the path of recently married young people, and the older generation are painlessly and profitably dismissed from any proximity to the pair, whom we leave' setting out on a new road with a tolerance and hope that promise suceess.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS336145284/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=39efdfef,"'Two New Novels by Turnbull and Miss Veronica' is my new book.

CHILDREN'S HISTORY BOOKS AMANDA CRAIG
L§m£J$mm*rLjfii4:i%i ■ M t""jV:
Embattled as we are by the unintelligent prescriptions of the national curriculum, we desperately need good history books. Yet while nonfiction is storming ahead with series such as Terry Deary's Horrible Histories, historical fiction has never regained the heights it achieved in the 1960s when books by Geoffrey Trease, Roger Lancelyn Green and Rosemary Sutcliffe made us all history boys and girls. One writer who is helping to fill the gap is Caroline Lawrence, whose Roman Mysteries series deserves its devoted following. The Colossus of Rhodes takes our quartet of multicultural detectives out of the city and across the sea towards Greece, into danger at the hands of a brutal slave-dealer. Though its dialogue lacks subtlety, it compensates with a lively, detailed knowledge of classical history. Eleanor Updale's burglarturned-gentleman, Montmorency, is now middleaged, and anxious for the safety of his friendls nephew, Frank. The rise of both trade

unionism and the Mafia in Italy, England and America put the young aristocrat at the heart of a conspiracy in Montmorency and the Assassins, and he has to use every scrap of acting ability leamt from our hero to survive. A complex and satisfying thriller, its enjoyable features include advances in Victorian radiology, and the intertwining of real-life people such as Edison and Puccini with a fictional cast. There is even more derring-do with Michael Molloy's Peter Raven Under Fire, a Hornblower for youngsters that will make them experts on Napoleonic naval techniques in the wake of a terrific, rip-roaring adventure about slaves, piracy and the Caribbean. K. M. Grant's Green Jasper, the sequel to her excellent debut, Blood Red Horse, is set in the time of Richard the Lionheart. The crusades feature heavily in Key Stage 3 history, and this swashbuckling , romance about a kidnapped bride and a noble horse loved by both Christian and Muslim is a romping read.
For students of the Victorian era, Dorothy Edwards's A Strong and Willing Girl is also captivating It is based on her aunt's experiences of being in service as a 10-year-old in 1887, and displays an artless authenticity that charms. Of nonfiction books, Paul Dowswell's Introduction to the Second World War, written under the auspices of the Imperial War Museum, is superb. It lays out information in clear, vivid paragraphs, lavishly illustrated by dramatic, period photographs. The Battle of Britain, the defeat of Japan and the role of the Resistance are covered in detail, and the book offers recommendations for film and TV, plus valuable links to the internet Highly recommended. Book House has had the inspired idea of turning the lives of great leaders into graphic novels. Each has four pages of biographical overview, then plunges into Marvel comic-style action accounts of the lives of such figures as Queen Elizabeth I, Alexander, Julius Caesar, Hernan Cortes and Spartacus, with battles and murder looming large. It isn't Art Spiegelman, but an amazing amount of information is packed into this dramatic format, which will persuade reluctant junior historians to keep reading. The most enchanting history book of all, however, is Egyptology. Purporting to be the diaries of Miss Emily Sands, an archaeologist iri 1926, its pages contain a mysterious curse, a game of senet, fabulous foldouts and much information. The burnished gold cover, with its jewelled Horus, enthrals children even before they open it and fall in love with the past — which is what all history books should make us do, but seldom manage.
