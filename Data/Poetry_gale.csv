THE NOT DEAD by Simon Armitage THE FIRST WORLD WAR marked the bloody heyday of war poetry. The combination of a highly literate fighting force and long periods of enforced inactivity and conditions of extreme horror produced poetry of a quality and quantity that will never (perhaps mercifully) be equalled. Will another Wilfred,Owen or Siegfried Sassoon emerge from the wars in Afghanistan or Iraq? I doubt it. The blog, and not the poem, is the preferred word-weapon of today's soldier. Yet contemporary war poetry is being written, albeit seldom by those at the front. The wars in which we are mired have each lasted longer than the First World War, and war has been woven grimly into the national consciousness. ""It could be argued,"" writes Simon Armitage, that ""the permanent backdrop of our current military situation makes almost every poem a war poem"". The Not Dead is Armitage's brilliant and painful evocation of the pity of modern warfare, less concerned with the blood and bullets ofthe bat-
tlefield than the carnage left behind in soldiers' minds. The ""Not Dead"" are the surviving soldiers, broken in mind and body, uncelebrated, invisible and ignored. Armitage's anger is reminiscent of Tommy, Rudyard Kipling's poem condemning the casual civilian disdain for the humble squaddie: We are morbidly ill. Soldiers with nothing but time to kill, we idle now in everyday clothes and ordinary towns, blowing up, breaking down. The poems in this collection were written for the film ofthe same name, a collaboration with the director Brian Hill exploring the lives of returning soldiers, that was broadcast last year on Remembrance Sunday. Each poem in this collection is a vivid little biography: the UN ""blue lid"" in Bosnia, haunted by the killers he waved through his checkpoint on their way to murder; the veteran of the Malayan Emergency taken from an oily Manchester canal to a burning river in the jungle; the Iraq war infantryman who must patrol, every day, over the ""blood-shadow"" left by the corpse of the looter he shot. These are poems about what happens when the heat of battle gives way to the brutal chill of a Home Front, where the home fires do not burn.

Poetry Hugh Lupton
*&/,.,£$& Dear Alice
DEAR ALICE Narratives of Madness by Tom Pow THERE WAS A SHIFT in the understanding of lunacy in the early 1800s. The Enlightenment had turned its back on old superstitious notions that madness was somehow connected to ignorance and sin; the madness of George III made the admission of insanity more socially acceptable and popularised the idea that it was an illness that could be treated. And the Dissenters, particularly Quakers, had begun to promote a new, humane system of dealing with insanity. What they called ""Moral Treatment"" encouraged good diet, exercise, and work in ordered farms and gardens. Samuel Tuke (a pioneer of this style of treatment) wrote that in cases of madness the ""intellectual, active and moral powers are usually rather perverted than obliterated"". In the first half of the 19th century there was a huge growth in private and public hospitals for the insane. The old regime of barred cells and ""strait-waistcoats"" began to give way to more kindly systems. Madhouses became asylums, madmen became patients. We can glimpse this new regime in
accounts of John Clare during his 23-year stay in the Northamptonshire General Lunatic Asylum. The newspaper editor Spencer Hall visited him as he worked in the asylum gardens, ""rather burly, florid, with light hair and somewhat shaggy eyebrows, and dressed as a plain but respectable farmer, in drab or stone-coloured coat and smalls, with gaiters,... and altogether as clean and brushed up as for market or fair"". Clare was convinced that he was being kept there to be ""fed up for a fight"" (he had delusions that he was a famous prize fighter). When Hall suggested that his reputation as a poet outshone his reputation as a fighter, Clare replied: ""Oh poetry, ah, I know, I once had something to do with poetry, a long time ago: but it was no good. I wish, though, they could get a man with courage enough to fight me."" These tensions between asylum containment and open fields, between delusion and reason, run through Tom Pow's extraordinary new book of poems, Dear Alice: Narratives of Madness. The collection circles around the Crichton Asylum in Dumfries — now part of Glasgow University. Founded in the 1830s, the asylum was initially part of the same humane impulse as Samuel Tuke's ""Moral Treatment"". Its 150-year existence charted a shifting and evolving understanding of mental illness and the permeability of identity. This social history is at the root of the book. But madness remains a mystery. And the profound pain and distress of the afflicted makes a harrowing counterpoint to the therapeutic systems that have attempted to cure (or at least constrain) them. In Nightwatch, 1842 the poet treads the asylum corridors as a nurse and notes down the ""frac-
\X
Mental patient in straitjacket circa 1818 tured plots"" of the lunatic narratives that are cried out in the darkness: ... I give due ballast to the most frivolous claims — become master of reason when I've need to flatter the restless and noisy: ""What spikes your night are pictures"", I tell them. One's convinced That shadows cut her like knives ... In Questions of Judgement we see the inmates working the fields of the Crichton Home Farm Steading: ... They are judged by simple needs: a plenitude of food, fresh air and exercise. Each evening heading home, the huge clock-face confronts them like a new moon binding them to the slow seasons of growth ... Two poems in the collection feature Charcot and Freud, and there is a sequence that addresses the collective madness of the First World War (when Crichton was a place of convalescence). But it is when Tom Pow speaks of the patients themselves,
their case histories, their torments and consolations, that the book finds its heart. We read of M, who, during her menstruation tried to rescue a hen from a pond, and was mad for the rest of her life. We meet Angus McKay, piper to Queen Victoria, who lost his mind ""over study of music"". And in Grass we meet Angus McPhee, who in the 1970s and 1980s was weaving grass into clothes at Crichton ""for the weaver's own joy and to praise/ The industry of hands"". In Resistances Pow ends with a coda that speaks for all the inmates as they address the note-takers who have recorded them: the things I could tell you but again you would sift them through the grid of your understanding and then you would not be speaking for me which is all I ask this clouded evening that somewhere in the silence there is someone who speaks with indifference in a small voice for me The final poem of the cycle is addressed to ""The Great Asylums of Scotland"". In it Pow sets the noble impulses that built them against the suffering the buildings have contained, and their present dereliction: In attic rooms the sky's light pours over a tide-wrack of maps, plans, records — a grid to lay over a waste of rage, grief, anger and pain. None of that will make a cairn ... The grid, Tom Pow implies, is ofour making: the grid of reason and rationality. The old asylums are empty now. That grandiose 19th-century impulse has been left behind. And what of their inmates? ... though of the mad, little could be salvaged — not one knitted pullover, not one apron — ... The melancholy we mourn they transformed into bread, milk, sunlight. John Clare, bent over his spade in the Northampton asylum, would nod his amen to that.

SELECTED POEMS by Eilean Ni Chuilleanain SEA LEVEL by Angela Leighton AMONG THE MOST distinguished Irish poes other generation, Eilean Ni Chuilleanain's clean, uncluttered lines sing out from the page. Their simplicity is altogether deceptive, however; her propositions are enigmatic, and from her earliest poems we are invited into a fairytale world of ransoms and mysterious tasks: Ants have helped me To sort the millet and barley grains. I have washed bloodstains from the enchanted shirt. There is an unease beneath every moonlit silence. In one bf the sections taken from The Rose Geranium, the central figure opens an egg given to her by a wise woman and finds inside ""some of her own hair, a tooth still bloody from her own mouth""; an inexplicable, chilling discovery. Sometimes there is a story behind a poem that the reader is able to piece together, In MacMoransbridge, for instance, sisters of a dead man remain so in awe of him that they dare not touch his desk, simply going on with their own tasks, ""boiling up mutton shanks for broth"" and so fail to discover his will. The strangest of these stories have the force of myth; for instance, the poem about a girl who falls in love with a reindeer. Her family are appalled by her departure into his frozen world. On a visit home, ""They slipped a powder in her drink/ So she forgot her child, her friend."" When the reindeer dies, he is seen to have the naked body of a man, and his curse destroys the old Queen. The poem resolves as the child
from the North — ""His hair was bleached, his skin blistered"" — comes to release his mother from the spell. Angela Leighton's Sea Level is the second book of a much younger poet who uses many different voices. Often her poems are language-led, and she relies on a glittering surface of unusual words; her play with sounds ""a water-slipper, whippersnapper"" suggesting an invention so rapid that she has to check it: ""What is the quick of this quick sand?"" She experiments with typography rather as Black Mountain poets once did, using 2 em spaces as a means of insisting on pauses. Consider the images from the natural world she finds for Kings College Chapel: It is strip-willow, pillars like wicks of rushes scored upright from the lodes and dug channels. It is flood plains in flower, trimming heaven, carex, calamus, windlestraw on the common. She writes impressive elegies for Miklos Radnoti and Michael Donaghy, but her most individual voice is as sinister as Plath conflating the murderous with the sexual. In her remarkable Cousin Butchers, Leighton observes the limbs that ""... lie with such abandoned purpose here/ Landscaped in trays, like sudden/ Rare colourists of what lies hidden in us"". She is clearly an original poet and may come to be an important one.

Latitude Festival Henham Park, Southwold ••••-fr Lisa Verrico
They didn't have a hope of starting a singalong, but Sigur Ros still pulled the largest crowd at Latitude. The Icelandic band, who sing either in lll§llil§ their native tongue or in an even stranger-sounding, made-up language, may have breached the British Top Ten for the first time in their 14-year career with their current album Med Sud i Eyrum Vid Spilum Endalaust, but as festival headliners they arrived on stage with scant experience. They did bring along a splendid collection of gigantic globe lanterns, which were suspended above them, and enough dry ice to turn a picturesque hillside in Suffolk into what looked like an eerie scene from an old movie. If that was the intention, the frontman Jonsi Birgisson played the flamboyant villain to perfection. Sporting silver, glittery stripes on his cheeks, with feathers protruding from the high collar of a black, buckled jacket with fringed sleeves, he sawed manically at his guitar with a bow and sang in a searing, spooky falsetto. Did it matter that no one knew the words? Not a jot. Backed by a sumptuous band that, from old number Glosoli onwards, included a female string section in Victorian dress and,
later, a brass band in white suits and matching bowler hats, Sigur Ros delivered a majestic set that was spellbinding from start to finish. Their elegant, pounding surge of othe-worldly sounds reached its peak on Hoppipolla, best known as the theme from the TV series Planet Earth, when fans could no longer resist the urge to join in and chanted ludicrous, fabricated lyrics. As
He sawed manically at his guitar with a bow and sang in a spooky falsetto
confetti rained down during the aptly titled, but still utterly incomprehensible Festival, Sigur Ros had achieved what few thought them capable of — enchanting an enormous crowd outdoors in the dark. Earlier, Elbow had been almost as bewitching, though only sporadically so in a set that was distinctly down-tempo. Each member arrived armed with a brass instrument, adding stabs to the opener Starlings, but too often the mournful majesty of songs from their current album, The Seldom Seen Kid, teetered towards morose. One exception was Grounds for Divorce, which sounded like Crosstown Traffic mixed with Sledgehammer-era Peter Gabriel, in
which the frontman Guy Garvey banged what looked like a piece of lead piping with a stick. Garvey lacked a little in the charisma department — he seemed like a lovely bloke, but wasn't convincing as a star. At least not until the closing number, One Day Like This, a string-drenched, orchestral epic that may well have been the weekend's highlight. If Garvey ever needs an ego, boost, he should
listen back to that track and the army of admirers who howled along. Less lucky were the acts who played in Latitude's tents. Or rather, their fans. The weather held out for most of the weekend, but there was one continual criticism: the tents were too small. Anyone wishing to see an act had to save a space early, and plenty were left disappointed. #

THE ANNOTATED COLLECTED POEMS OF EDWARD THOMAS edited by Edna Longley EDWARD THOMAS was a man who turned from a hack writer into a remarkable poet practically overnight. Born in 1878, he made a meagre living until 1914 by writing topographical and nature books, and endless book reviews. Then two things happened. He met the American poet Robert Frost, who urged him to write poetry, and the First World War broke out. Through these disparate events, something was liberated in him. He wrote his first poem in December 1914, and over the next two years, before he was killed by shrapnel at Arras, he wrote another 141. In them he
revealed himself as one of the most subtle and fascinating poets of the 20th century. Suddenly his relationship with nature appeared as something quite different from what one finds in his prose books. Those were mainly a straightforward celebration of the English countryside, both its wildlife and its ancient human traditions. In the poetry, another side of the man emerged. The love of nature was unmistakeably there. But the poems spoke of a longing, inspired by nature, for something beyond it. In Old Man, which was probably only his third poem, he beautifully describes a feathery herb growing at his cottage door called Old Man or Lad's Love. But he values only its bitter scent — and that only because it leaves him lying in wait for something he ""should, yet never can remember..."" In Sedge-Warblers he draws a brilliant portrait of these little birds ""clinging so light to willow twigs"" — but what he finds significant is that in their song they ""reiterate endlessly""
'Poems of a longing inspired by nature' something that ""no man learnt yet, in or out of school"". His most famous poem, Adlestrop, is about a country railway station where his train stopped ""unwontedly"". He heard a blackbird singing, and then, around him, sang ""mist-
ier/ Farther and farther, all the birds/ Of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire"". This is not just a celebration of singing blackbirds. It is a poem about a vision in his mind of some kind of fading, ""mistier"" paradise. He married when he was still at Oxford and only 21, while his wife Helen was just 20. One poem, in beautiful halting lines, begins ""No one so much as you/ Loves this my clay... None ever was so fair/ As I thought you"". But it goes on to say, very painfully, that he ""could not ever burn/With the love you have"". Even in love he knew a sad, strange detachment in himself. He enlisted in the Army in 1915, but was never really a war poet, though the war looms up in the background in many of his poems. How much he. cared for his family shows in a set of four exquisite poems he wrote in April 1316, imagining what he would like to give to his three daughters and to Helen. But the old note is struck for almost the last time in the poem to Helen. He
would, he says, like to ""give you back yourself — and, he adds: ""myself, too, if I could find/Where it lay hidden and it proved kind."" Edna Longley has produced an excellent edition of Thomas's poetry, though it is rather a startling volume with its 108 pages for poems, and its 177 pages for notes. It is as though she has poured a lifetime's study into the notes, accumulating an immense quantity of fact and analysing the poems from every kind of critical angle: formal, biographical, historical, psycho-analytical and sociological. Nevertheless the notes are well worth wading into. She makes fascinating comparisons between Thomas's prose and poetic versions of similar subjects, and in all her spheres comes up with rewarding apercus. What she has not learnt from Thomas is his economy with words.

Verse from three perspectives
i Mick imlah
BLOODSHOT MONOCHROME by Patience Agbabi THE LOST LEADER by Mick Imlah SEA CHANGE by Jorie Graham READING THESE THREE collections, I was struck by how differently these poets define their responsibility to their readers. Patience Agbabi has the clearest idea of who her audience is. A renowned performer of her work, in Bloodshot Monochrome Agbabi uses poetic form to continue her performance on the page. Foreign Exchange is the best of the collection's many sonnets. It describes a racist encounter in Hamburg: ... reminding me of school, that French exchange, a simple sentence, Parce qu'elle est noire, delivered at such speed and with such hatred it stung me: to encounter so much rage; more, for being judged solely by colour; but most, the fact it had to be translated. Unfortunately, Agbabi does not always craft her cadences
and choose her rhymes so carefully. The sonnet sequence Vicious Circle tells the story of a film-noir love triangle. The story has plenty of intrigue and betrayal, but the sequence is marred by a relentless staccato rhythm, short sentences and repetitive syntax: the poems cry out for a performer to animate them. Problem Pages is more assured. In this sequence, Agbabi plays agony aunt to 14 dead poets, who are having problems with their sonnets. We hear from canonical names (Milton, Keats), all-butforgotten female poets (Lady Mary Wroth, Charlotte Smith) and key black poets (Claude* McKay, June Jordan). It's a risky way of both invoking influences and putting them in their place, and testament to Agbabi's verve and confidence that she pulls it off. To move from Agbabi to Mick Imlah's The Lost Leader is to feel the poetic line slowing and the texture thickening. You're going to have to work harder, but these subtle poems will repay return visits. The Lost Leader is a book of enormous ambition: 20 years in the making and twice as long as most slim volumes, it offers a poetic history of Scotland starting at the year dot (""before/ Colum and Camelot""). Along the way, we hear from some familiar and not-so-familiar Scottish heroes: Robert fhe Bruce and Michael Scot, Bonnie Prince Charlie and Gordon Brown (the rugby player, not the politician). The collection ends with a stunning, full-throated lyric that draws parallels between
LYNDON DOUGLAS
rejected art and the stars. The poet wonders if they dream away their loss of face in a sky like that; if there, though day's glare or the northern night obscure them, though nature has done with them, still through the void they hurtle their wattage, powered with the purpose of having been — being, after all, stars, whose measure we may not take, nor know the wealth of their rays. Douglas Dunn offers one precedent for the consummate formal achievement of these poems, but otherwise Imlah situates himself among much earlier literary models: Edwin Muir, Robert Browning and James Thomson. Indeed Im-
lah remains hard to place on a map of contemporary Scottish poetry. His playful-yet-elegiac formalism seems untouched by Don Paterson's satirical bite, or W. N. Herbert's surreal, knockabout humour. As a history of Scotland, The Lost Leader might be a late tackle; but as a display of poetic forms and resources, the collection is invaluable. Jorie Graham is the most private of these three poets. While she has a considerable following in the US, and a growing number of admirers on these islands, her poetry does not seek out connections with the reader. Instead, Graham explores connections between her perceptions and experiences. Sea Change is a series of meditations on political and environmental fears. Many poems
Patience Agbabi takes on the role of agony aunt to 14 dead poets
begin in anxious observation: ""Deep autumn & the mistake occurs, the plum tree blossoms."" Graham is adept at capturing such moments. She is a poet of transitions and transformations, rather than closely painted images. No Long Way Round begins: Evening. Not quite. High winds again. I have time, my time, as you also do, there, feel it. And a heart, my heart, as you do, remember it. Also am sure of some things, there are errands, this was a voyage ... To a greater extent than most poets would dare, Graham demands that poetry should answer to its moment. Fler work can be difficult, and does not always avoid portentousness: ""there is a form of slavery in everything"". Nevertheless, Graham's poetry is exhilarating because of its ability to open a space of cleareyed hope. This hope is usually located in artistic creation or, as here, the silence that precedes the creative moment: this will be a time again in which to make — a time of uselessness — the imagined human paradise.

An eerie poetry
GLISTER by John Bumside A RESPECTED NOVELIST confided to me recently that: she had a ""reservation about novels written by poets"". Why? I wondered. Two of our greatest poets, Thomas Hardy and D. II. Lawrence, were also fine novelists and John Burnside's 12 collections of poetry and six novels put him in the Hardy and Lawrence class. Burnside deploys language with a poet's acuity, deftly registering shifts of consciousness and shades of description but never imposing ""poetical"" visions. Glister is set in Innertown, a bleak No Man's Place whose isolated community once serviced a chemical plant. The plant has spawned human fatalities and engendered the strange fauna and flora found on the eerie headland where the derelict buildings remain. Only Leonard, the novel's 15-year-old protagonist, with a father in the last stages of cancer, visits them now. His mother has scarpered, leaving her son to carry the can, which he does literally, dealing with his father's blood and vomit. Leonard is, understandably, discontented, but intellectually savvy and an avid reader. He devours Henry James and Proust; and he also consorts with Elspeth, who attracts his attention at the local library by offering him oral sex. There is a slight sense that this and subsequent sexual excursions are there to lend respectability to Henry James. This was a moment when I felt a rare touch of authorial pressure. However, this is a small cavil. The unfolding ofthe sinister story of the ""lost boys"" who have gone ""missing"" is done with skill. Perhaps a mite too predictably, the disappearances are accredited to a supposed paedophile, by a gang of youthful misfits to which Leonard, with qualms, attaches himself. The qualms are tempered by the allure of Eddie, whose passivity and violence strike a resonant violence from Leonard. Eddie rings utterly true; as does the itinerant, mild-mannered ""moth man"", the key to the novel's startling denouement where Burnside's twin talents fuse and darkly shine.

Alexander Monro on the Chinese-British Yellow Mountain poetry festival
FOR A FEW MOMENTS on a Cardiff afternoon this week the ""tree"" that forms the lynchpin of the Welsh Senned provided shelter for a polyglot parliament of the poets, formally launching the 2008 Yellow Mountain Festival. The object was for poets of the English and Chinese languages to conduct joint translations, all funded by the Arts Council and the businessman and poet Luo Ying, dubbed ""China's richest poet"". Founded two years ago by the Chinese poet Yang Lian, whose collections have appeared in several languages (and whose poetry appears in the Bloodaxe anthology In Person: see overleaf) and the English poet Fiona Sampson, the Editor of Poetry Review, this year's festival began at St Donat's Castle on the Glamorgan coast with four days of translation work in pairs. Translation of poetry is a knotty business, with the results tending more towards recreation than replication. But when the languages are Chinese and English, the challenge is greater still. Imagine translating from a language whose written words are fixed without letters, which has no agreements, only rarely indicates plurality or tense, disdains all but a few conjunctions and achieves much of its musicality through its four tones. ""Poetry in translation means that you have two different trees that grow from the same root,"" Yang Lian explained. ""At first we thought Chinese was more visual, whereas English, and especially Welsh, were more musical, but we found that the good poems provide all these layers."" Yang emerged as a poet in 1980s China and was eventually criticised for ""spiritual pollution"". After 1989, he became an exile and has since lived in Auckland and London. ""For Yang, everything is driven by the pictorial implications of the characters, as though he's uncovering hieroglyphs in ancient languages,"" his principal translator Brian Holton explains. Such culturally or linguistically defined images, metaphors and allusions risk spawning translations that are prolix, flat or plagued by footnotes. Instead, invention tends to win out. ""It's not only meaning, or we could write novels,"" said Robert Minhinnick, the award-winning poet and editor of Poetry Wales. ""You might change the structure or feeling. The key is images and sound — sensory things."" The Chinese script has bequeathed its poets an extraordinary capacity for ambiguity, thanks to its pareddown grammar and lack of agree ments. In some lines, four unrelated objects are listed vvith no words in between sometimes, Yang says, Ihe tones provide the only link.

Visual impact: Yang Lian, founder of the Yellow Mountain Festival publishing his poetry since the 1980s, alludes frequently to the history of Chinese literature. ""Until 2002 he taught Western literature exclusively. Now he only teaches classical Chinese literature,"" Arthur Sze, an American poet and lecturer at the festival says. ""It's almost as though he only learnt to use Western techniques for his own purposes."" For China, modernity was a Western import, and with it came new literary influences, among them Ezra Pound, who imitated the bald but graceful expressiveness of classical Chinese poetry. ""Translation has this ability to bring in different angles, whether on values, human life, even on a chair,"" says Yan Li, whose poetry has been translated into several languages. It is this engagement abroad that
fThe key is images and sound - sensory things'
marks the new paths that Chinese poets have struck out on over the past decade or two — it is also the concern of the festival, and of the anthology it will publish next year. As I leave St Donat's Castle, Yang is explaining to Sampson that the hanging clouds in his poem are like curtains on a stage but that, as they roll open, they also allow you to reveal your inner self. This is Yang at his conceptual best, always seeking out greater symbolisms, what he calls ""that self sufficient universe of poetry"" that Pound had striven fbr.

WHEN GEORGE W. BUSH leaves office, the war will finally come to an end. For years the President has struggled, locked in mortal combat, determined to crush and destroy an enemy that his father confronted before him. At times, Bush seemed weighed down by the conflict, but he never gave up the fight. This war was personal. I refer, of course, to George W. Bush's single-handed and brutal battle with the English language. No leader of modern times (with the possible exception of John Prescott) has attacked the language with such sustained violence. No other politician can match Bush's ability to mangle syntax and sense into surreal shapes. quite simple sentences found themselves remoulded into Byzantine complexity in the from Bush's brain to his mouth. Malapropisms, neologisms, spoonerisms, mispronunciations and other verbal exotica out ofthe President in torrents. Rogue would suddenly wander into his senand refuse to leave. Verbs, prepositions, were locked in permanent conflict. Weisberg, editor of Slate magazine, becollecting these ""Bushisms"" at the start of Bush Administration, and has since pubno less than six volumes of the Presiverbal gaffes, selling more than half a copies and almost as many calendars. Covering Bush's campaign in 2000 was an exercise in approximate translation. I privileged to be present in Iowa when told an audience: ""It's a world of madand uncertainty and potential mential losses."" I still have no idea what he meant, the word has entered my family's lexicon: a ""mential loss"" is what happens whenever anyone says something particularly idiotic, or mislays the car keys. Bush's refashioning of the language might be incomprehensible, but it also had a sort of accidental, internal poetry. An enterprising schoolteacher, Dirk Schulze, welded together some of Bush's more famously peculiar phrases to create an entire poem:
Rarely is the question asked: ""Is our children learning?"" Will the Highways of the Internet become more few? How many hands have I shaked? Occasionally, Bush can get stuck in his own
circular grammar, producing a mellifluous if
meaningless rap: ""When I was coming up, it was a dangerous world, and you knew exactly who they were. It was us versus them, and it was clear who them was. Today, we are not so sure who the they are, but we know they're there."" This is reminiscent of Donald Rumsfeld, the acknowledged master of inadvertent existential poetry: As we know, There are known knowns. There are things we know we know. We also know There are known unknowns. Opinion has long been divided over whether Bush's inarticulacy is natural or partly feigned,
the mark of an honest Texan with no time for fancy talk, or evidence of mental (and possibly mential) confusion. Sometimes Bush's linguistic slips brought out a hidden truth. He once declared that racial quotas tended to ""vulcanise society"". He meant to say ""Balkanise"", of course, but the malapropism probably more nearly captured what he meant: vulcanisation (after Vulcan, the Roman God of fire) is the process whereby rubber is cured with sulphur or other chemicals to create an artificial substance that is harder, denser and insoluble. A society divided by race is truly vulcanised. Weisberg himself admits that ""Bushisms give a misimpression of Bush; and the misimpression is they make him sound like he's dumb."" Bush is careless of the way he speaks, he reaches for long words and then falls over them, but this is very far from a sign of stupidity. In Weisberg's words: ""He has some particular kinds of intelligence that serve him very well. He has a strong interpersonal intelligence in that he reads people very quickly and very well."" Many Americans came to relish his unique way with words. Bush became adept at mocking his own inarticulacy. One never knew where the language might take him, and nor did he. 1 rememberafter one particularly baffling extemporised speech, when Bush passed the press corps he simply grinned and asked: ""Bumble though OK?"" In part, Bush's language is inherited, for his father was prone to the same linguistic chaos. The former President startled a group of foreign tourists in 1992 by attempting to begin a conversation with the words ""I ley, hey, nihaoma. Hey, yeah, yeah. Heil, heil-a kind of Hitler salute."" Nihaoma is Mandarin for ""How are you?"" The rest is untranslatable. In the end, Bush's numerous assaults on the English language did no harm, which cannot be said of his other battles. At a rally in Oregon recently, President Bush declared: ""1 hope you leave here and walk out and say: 'What did he say?'"". Ofthe epitaphs on the Bush era, ""What did he say?"" will be among the kindest.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0503861092/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=dce9f9ad

Poetry Tobias Hill
ANTHONY TBWTE
COLLECTED POEMS by Anthony Thwaite BY MOST ACCOUNTS, the poetry of Anthony Thwaite is all well and good: well travelled and good humoured, well read and good natured. ""Modest"", according to one critic, ""unflashy"", according to another. Born in 1930, and inextricably associated with the poetic movements of the 1950s, Thwaite is seen as a poet unfond of peacockery and extremes. It is a surprise, then, to
come away from his Collected Poems with a sense of having read something spectacular. Certainly, the early poems are modest — or so wary as to seem so. In the earliest there is a sense of lockjawed formality, the flow of the poetry stilted by enjambement and attenuated grammar. By 1963, however, he has moved into new territory — the influence of Larkin tempered by a meditative domestic stillness in Night Thoughts and A Sense of Property (Frost at Midnight is the polestar here). By the late 1960s Thwaite not only has escaped Larkin's shadow but has broken out of his own restraints, his voice more expansive and wholly his own. Collected Poems allows the reader both hindsight and a bird's eye view: patterns are more easily discerned from
these vantage points. In Thwaite, in the remarkable work ofthe 1960s and 1970s as elsewhere, there always runs an undercurrent of disquiet. Often it surfaces in domestic scenes, as in the many poems devoted to vermin — rats, woodworm, flies and cockroaches. Thwaite's parasites infest his dwellings, eating away at the fabric of things. Often they are killed, with a frantic, clumsy violence. It is a motif that occurs in the earliest poems in this book and which is consciously returned to in the last, The Space Between: here, Thwaite hears a rat in his roof and lets it live, not because the poet has come to terms with his cohabitant, but because the rat is beyond his grasp, so deeply embedded in the structure of his property
that he can no longer reach it. The precision of these poetic disturbances is memorable; there is always the property, the infestation, and the destructive urge; the elements nag like those of a recurrent dream. These are poems ener-
'Parasites infest his dwellings, eating away'
gised by disturbance, by an apprehension of impermanenee, and it is this same apprehension that powers some of the most striking pieces in this book, Thwaite's archaeological poems. Archaeology is present in
his early poems, but it is in the late 1960s and early 1970s that the potential of the theme is realised. In the poems of The Stones of Emptiness and Inscriptions, Thwaite's language becomes richer, his references more fertile: the archaeological poems are the main current rather than the first wellspring of his talent. The 12~poem sequence The Letters of Synesius remains electrifying, as does Monologue in the Valley of the Kings: 1 have hidden something in the inner chamber And sealed the lid of the sarcophagus And levered a granite boulder across the door And the debris has covered it so perfectly That though you walk over it daily you never suspect.
This is spectacular poetry. It deserves to be read: good readers deserve to read it. The Collected ends with 16 new poems. In these, Thwaite returns to the formality that characterises much of his work, but he does so with assurance. And here, too, there is a return of the old nagging unease, the anxious domesticity, as in Spring: I have heard a note strike that doesn't sound right. As the logs smoulder away in the steep ash The hot bricks speak against the iron grate. This is beyond the pull and the drift and the wish.

Plenty tp get your teeth into but lyrics lack bite
Little Shop of Horrors Duke of York's, WC2 •••##________ Benedict Nightingale The nerd who has discovered and nurtured the plant names it Audrey II, which isn't exactly a compliment to the girl he forlornly loves. After all, it's one thing to have a rose (Audrea pulchrissima?) called after you. It's quite another to be immortalised in, and eventually eaten by, a gigantic triffid with parts that variously evoke an octopus, a pterodactyl, asparagus, a penis, a crab and dentures as they might have been custom-built for a piranha family. As constructed by David Farley and accoutred with Mike McShane's big, booming voice, this dietetically ambitious Venus flytrap provides Howard Ashman and Alan Menken's musical with a thoroughly satisfactory villain. But, speaking of teeth, there's a second, subsidiary baddie. That's Alistair McGowan's sadistic Orin Scrivello, who flings aside his biker's leathers to reveal a dentist's uni-
form beneath — and is subsequently seen gleefully taking pliers to our wimpish hero's mouth while dosing himself with laughing gas. Maybe that's a parody of Marathon Man, in which, you may recall, a Naziloving Laurence Olivier had a go at Dustin Hoffman's molars. But then Little Shop of Horrors is a parody of just about every sci-fi movie and play, starting with The Rocky Horror Show, which was a parody itself. Everyone who saw Matthew White's Horrors revival at the Menier Chocolate Factory last November seems to have enjoyed it, and, though transfer has clearly deprived it of intimacy, everyone should enjoy it now that it is following the same theatre's Sunday in the Park with George into the West End. The setting, also by Farley, is the last flower shop in an American Skid Row that consists of dustbins, lurking bums and shadowy fire-escapes. How to improve the place's unsurprisingly poor finances? Why, by putting Audrey II in the window and attracting fascinated customers as the plant grows and grows. The trouble is that the plant is not content with the blood provided from his finger-tips by its discoverer,
Paul Keating's namby-pamby Seymour. It wants and gets more: McGowan's evil dentist, Barry James as the shop-owner and, in the stage if not the film version, the adroitly hilarious Sheridan Smith as the cute, coquettish Audrey. An underclass trio calling themselves Chiffon, Crystal and Ronette belt out some big, strong tunes with plenty of brio but, sadly, with less effect than would have been the case if their words could be heard. The general view since the show's inception off-Broadway in 1982 is that the lyrics are far smarter than average, but my poll of audience members couldn't confirm the claim, because the balance between Ashman's rhymes and the orchestra favoured the latter by an acoustic walkover. This is a complaint I hear increasingly often these days. And who cares if, as is often the case, the lyrics improve with inaudibility? But this time it would be nice if we could relish more than the odd soft number. That way, a jolly spoof might become sophisticated fun. Box office: 0870 0606623 More reviews, times?.

Poetry Elaine Feinstein
BRIAN PATTEN HAS always been a gifted poet. Forty years ago his charm made him instantly popular, though his imagination sometimes seemed dangerously close to whimsy. Looking back at those early, precocious lyrics in his Selected Poems we can see that their surreal landscape is entirely genuine. So is the wistful tone of later poems. ""These boys never grow into men,"" he acknowledges. He has never lost touch with the sevenyear-old runaway, afraid he will be sniffed out by tracker dogs who have his lollipops. There are American debts. His fantasy of Maud, no longer in Tennyson's garden, but wearing a Mary Quant dress and eating fish and chips, has affinities with Allen Ginsberg's Walt Whitman in the Supermarket. His truest model, though, is English — Stevie Smith, whom he calls ""Blake's purest daughter"". He is less obsessed with death than she was, but he lets the darkness in. What he regrets most is what he has failed to record from a lost past: ""The loose change history spent without caring."" Michael Schmidt has always been a fine poet, but his life as editor, anthologist and professor has meant a gap of 20 years since his previous book of new poems and The Resurrection ofthe Body. The new work is stunning. The cat of a 9th-century Irish monk chases a quill over parchment. Suicide bombers wreck the exquisite geometries ofthe Golden Dome in Samarra. Sexual love remains a pervasive theme. The title poem tells the story of one of Christ's
miracles, but is also about the resurgence of desire. Jesus is holding a sick girl in his arms and, as she revives, she feels her nakedness has roused him. Schmidt writes particularly well about unease and ambiguity; of finding the scent of an earlier lover between his sheets: That autumn, when I lay with you, you started pretending These hands of mine were his hands in the dark, these lips And the tufts in my armpits, his... He writes with the most sadness of Don Juan, who once ""made love as other men make shoes or music"" and now can no longer swim where the mermaids do. Perhaps he has T. S. Eliot's voice in his ears, as Don Juan bids farewell to: 'The suck of their lips, the shimmer of their blue tails, And their hair that was green and silver, their cool breasts Which they said he could touch, which they held up for his kiss. Helen Dunmore reveals herself in Glad of These Times to be that rare creature, a poet who can write about happiness. Like D.H. Lawrence she feels gratitude for ""the great privilege of being alive"". She loves the world: ""the sour earth between wall and wheelie bin"", city lilacs, and blue gardens seen from a train. Her exuberant celebration of the 21st century — which gives the book its title — reminds us of many good fortunes forgotten in our fashionable gloom: Because I did not die in childbirth

His relationship with his own culture is ambiguous. As a boy, he confesses, he was embarrassed by his mother: That's why I'd bin the letters about parents evenings. Food from home is treated as sacred by the older generation and he doesn't always like it: Ladoo, for instance, a saffron-coloured sweetmeat the size of a golf ball, that his father thrusts into his unwilling mouth.

Three years since Love Actually brought us that inimitable hip-wiggle, we finally get a chance to see Grant shamelessly shaking it on a grander scale. He stars as Alex Fletcher, a has-been 1980s pop star who is offered the chance to write a song for a chart-topping teen sensation. In need of a lyricist, he stumbles upon a talent in the form of the ditzy plant-waterer Sophie Fisher (Barrymore) — sparks, of course, soon fly. A formulaic rom-com with two A-list leads who possess decent chemistry results in a sweet and fun easy watch. And though the plot is obvious and the script a little lazy, Barrymore looks fabulous and watching Grant leaping around as an 1980s pop star is not to be missed.

GRIEF LESSONS: Four Plays by Euripides DECREATION by Anne Carson
ANNE CARSON IS A POET, classicist and thoughtful delineator of the human heart. Her previous books, given awards including the T. S. Eliot Prize for Poetry, have focused on love and heartbreak and have included gorgeous translations of Sappho's love poems and meditations on Eros. At first glance, her most recent two books are a bleak departure. She has gone from Sappho to the wild misery of Euripides' tragedies in Grief Lessons, her new translations of four plays. And in her poetry she has produced Decreation, which begins with a series of poems on the illness of a fading mother. However, these books are full of life. The deconstruction and tragic annihilation are dramatised by Carson's graceful writing and deft trans-
lation. But in both works she moves on, back to life and the way it is and can be lived. In Grief Lessons she has chosen to translate some of the most chaotic tragedies of Ancient Greek literature. The title is significant — these are grief lessons, not gorefests. She writes in her introduction that Euripides ""breaks experiences open""; but his love of life shines through Carson's lucid poetry. In Hippolytus, a character mired in doom, as they all are, reflects: ""We humans seem disastrously in love with this thing / (whatever it is) that glitters on the earth —/We call it life."" Decreation was written first, published last year and is available in the UK now. The opening poems are full of the sorrow of a mother's old age, yet even the old lady's life is worthwhile. Carson writes: ""Weak suns yet alive/are as virtue to suns of that other day."" The next offering is an essay on sleep, a lively meditation on the liberating possibilities of sleep for the mind, drawing on authors as diverse as Woolf and Homer. The keystone of the book however, is a series of essays that allow the reader to understand why decreation is a positive activity rather than a process of decay. She examines the work of three female writers and their

!These are grief lessons not gorefests'
thoughts on abandonment of the self. First is Sappho with her breathless description of lust overtaking her, then Marguerite Porete, who wrote a treatise on closeness to God by abandoning self-will (and was burned for it in 1310) and Simone Weil, a philosopher of the last century, who also sought to abandon herself to God.
Her thoughts on this are complex; yet recognising that destruction is the beginning of something exciting is a good way to approach both these books. In both of them a very human poet shows us a life that is worthwhile and which should be embraced with abandon and joy.

The political is personal
Just don't mention the White House when the poet Adrienne Rich is around. John Freeman gets the message
THE PAST FOUR YEARS HAVE been good ones for poetry in America. A poet, Dana Gioia, was appointed head of the National Endowment of the Arts. Spoken-word events are packed. Even corporate largesse has come calling. In 2002 the pharmaceutical heiress Ruth Lily announced that she would be giving nearly $150 million (£75 million) to the magazine Poetry. Overnight, a tiny journal became one of the richest publications in the US. Good as this sounds, Adrienne Rich hasn't been rushing to celebrate. ""Poetry, the art, doesn't need billions infused into one institution,"" the 77-year-old poet said, her face souring. ""I think artists would do better in a society that was more economically just."" Looking a gifthorse in the mouth is one of her specialities. She has won nearly every prize available to an American poet and has turned down several. In 1978, she rejected the National Book Award as an individual to accept it on behalf of silenced voices everywhere. Bill Clinton wanted to give her the National Medal of Arts, but she refused.""I could not accept such an award from President Clinton or this White House because the very meaning of art is incompatible with the cynical politics of this Administration."" Sitting at an Italian restaurant in Manhattan, Rich doesn't look like a troublemaker. She is small and tidy,
her eyes beatific in moments of pleasure — for example when she talks about jazz or film or young people. But shift the conversation to governments and her voice grows hard and clear. ""I, for many, many years have felt not just that the personal becomes political,"" she says, ""but that the political becomes personal."" It is a remarkable statement from a poet who worked so hard to get the message across the other way around — that women's bodies were battlegrounds, that their voices had been silenced. But a lot has changed since the driving, declarative poems in
fShe has won so many prizes — and turned them down*
Snapshots of a Daughter-in-Law (1963) and Diving into the Wreck (1973) made Rich a feminist icon. Personal narrative — once a vehicle for feminism — has ushered in the Glamour magazine confessional. Women have obtained higher pay — but at what cost, Rich wonders. ""Women in political power can give us a Margaret Thatcher,"" she says. ""It's given us Condoleezza Rice. The question is: what does
one do with the power one gets?"" Rich has similar concerns about poetry now that it has millions and is emblazoned on subway cards. Accepting a lifetime achievement award from the National Book Foundation, recently, she defended it from commercialisation. ""Poetry is not a billboard,"" she said. ""It is not linguistic aromatherapy. It is not a massage."" Rich is particularly concerned with the state of political poetry, because in the US ""there are always arguments against poetry in the public discourse, arguments particularly against an engaged poetry"". Rich, born in Baltimore in 1929, came of age in the heyday of new criticism, when writers such as F. R. Leavis and William Empson all but crushed the notion that a poem could have a reference point outside itself. In a sense, she has had to fight this twice — first diving into the wreck of her identity as a woman, then backing out into the wider world. ""My [past five books] are interrogating the mood and what it's like to be in the US at this time, from a variety of perspectives,"" she says. ""Whether powerless or powerful, whether privileged or not, and how the conditions ofthe public world impinged on our own private lives, as I believe they do."" One does not have to look far to find examples of what Rich is talking about. ""Questions of who can you

love, what do we as individuals see and what do we not see, to paraphrase Muriel Rukeyser,"" she says, rattling off the latest flashpoints in American life. ""Also — what do we think of as the world? Americans have been prone to think of ourselves as the world."" One collection at a time, Rich is trying to smash that parochialism. Lately, her most receptive audience has been students. This is a change. Ten years ago, when she travelled the country, she would hear questions such as: ""How do I get published?"" and ""Do I need an agent as a poet?"" ""That doesn't come up now,"" Rich says, a smile breaking. ""The last place I had been was Northwestern University, and there were students there from all walks and many different
fields. And they all really wanted to talk about art and politics."" As Rich points out, this mixture of intellectual rigour and passion cannot be bought or created. It rises up out of the verse itself. ""Poetry can break open locked chambers of possibility,/ restore numbed tones of feeling, recharge desire,"" she once wrote about passion. It applies to politics, too, she has discovered, and is reminding us all over again.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0503017077/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=261da594
"Wilson, Jean Moorcroft",Memoirs of a poetry-writing boy,The Times,2006-Nov-11,"London, England","Memoirs of a poetry-writing boy
Even at the age of 12, Siegfried Sassoon took his vocation seriously. Jean Moorcroft Wilson is enthralled by some newly discovered verses by the great war poet
SIEGFRIED SASSOON'S mother decided early in his life that he was to be a poet, presenting him on his third birthday with a copy of Coleridge's Lectures on Shakespeare. Partly to avoid disappointing her, he started his first book of poems at 9 — an age when his two brothers were forging mock cannonballs in their makeshift workshop — dedicating it ""For Mamsy"". His second followed a few months later for her birthday in March 1897. Altogether there were — or so I thought when I wrote my 1999 biography of Sassoon — nine childhood notebooks written between 1896 and 1899. Described by Sassoon as ""scribblings"" and ""automatic poetising"", these little notebooks do anticipate some of his characteristic interests and concerns as a poet, in particular nature and a slight fixation with death. They also represent an invaluable apprenticeship, helping to prepare him for the memorable war poems to come. A tenth juvenile collection has
P»||M The poem the Sassoon notebook
now resurfaced in Australia. A tiny exercise book measuring approximately 6in by Min and just 18 pages long, its charmingly illustrated title page announces itself grandly as Verses on Various Occasions, a sign of how seriously Sassoon took his vocation at the age of 12. None of the poems is published, although some are repeat performances. To a Nightingale, for example, had appeared in earlier notebooks, indicating that even at 12 Sassoon was able to recognise a genuine poetic impulse when it escaped to give fresh life to well-worn themes and was already truly inspired by natural beauty: Suddenly from the trees a song so fair Through the still night like purest water flowing Each moment, lovelier and more perfect growing Borne on a breeze came floating on the air... This find is of particular interest for several reasons. It is almost cer-
tainly Sassoon's last childhood effort at composition before a new tutor, the hearty athletic Cambridge graduate Clarence Hamilton, made him feel that writing poetry was rather ""priggish"". (It would be another three years before his inspiration was reawakened by reading Thomas Hood at Marlborough College.) Its history also provides new insights into Sassoon's character and upbringing. The inheritor ofthis treasure, Gay McAuley, a professor of French and performance art at the University of Sydney, emigrated to Australia in 1968. It was a legacy from her aunt, the daughter ofthe original recipient, Sassoon's nursemaid, Emily Eyles. Painstakingly transcribed in February 1899, Verses on Various Occasions was the aspiring poet's wedding present to Emily. Born in 1878, Emily was the daughter of a blacksmith, and grew up with two or three younger brothers in Brightling, East Sussex, a village Sassoon never tired of nearing her describe. An intelligent child, she stayed on at school as a pupil-teacher before coming to work for Sassoon's mother at her home, Weirleigh, near Matfield, Kent. She was nominally a parlour maid, but Siegfried remembered that she quickly became his mother's ""only effective ally"", in preventing him and his two equally mischievous brothers ""from turning the whole house into a bear garden"". (The upwardly mobile Emily always described her job as ""nursery maid"", apparently a more prestigious position in the servant hierarchy.) The abrupt departure of her nanny and a reluctance to follow the middle-class practice of sending them to school had left Theresa Sassoon to deal single-handedly with three rowdy boys, aged 9 to 12. This made her particularly grateful to Emily who, according to Sassoon, had inherited her blacksmith father's ""fortitude"". Despite the air of innocence and fragility given by her blue eyes and fair hair, she had no difficulty in handling the Sassoon boys with the necessary firmness. Although ""very ladylike in every way"", she greatly enjoyed listening in later life to broadcasts of prize-fights, Gay McAuley recalls, a side of her that helps to explain how she could ""deal so cheerfully with three wild boys, growing up without discipline of school"" — or of father. Alfred Sassoon had abandoned his wife and sons before Siegfried was 5, leaving Theresa, in her loneliness, closer to her servants than most. She was also more enlightened than many of her Victorian contemporaries in her dealing with them. When
s •
Emily married, not only did Theresa attend the wedding but also acted as one of the witnesses. Her present to the bride — an invitation to choose her favourite painting at Weirleigh — shows how close they had become. The family's recollections of the picture, which hung in a place of honour in Emily's dining room, suggest that she chose a work by Theresa herself, a professional painter before her marriage. It showed a boy standing in a doorway, and may well have represented Siegfried, who often served as his mother's model. Siegfried was equally attached to Emily. She was only eight years his senior, and much closer to him than any other woman, apart from his mother, in a predominantly female household. She would often join in his games with his brothers, helping them to find their cricket ball when it was lost in the sweet-briar hedge, or taking them for bicycle rides. The Sassoon boys had taught her to ride a bicycle in the first place.
THis gratitude contrasts with his distrust of other women1
Having discovered them driving their grandmother's brake-less bathchair down a steep hill near Weirleigh, their mother, initially reluctant, had decided that bicycles might be less dangerous. Emily was also taken for swimming lessons with them in the muddy Medway near by although, like Siegfried, she hated the activity. Siegfried particularly appreciated her practice of reading the boys' favourite books to them when they finally felt like sitting still in the evening: The Coral Island, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Around the World in Eighty Days, Treasure Island, Black Beauty and, less predictably, The Diary ofa Nobody. A ""gently, loving and generous person"", according to her granddaughter, Emily was very lively and gaily performed these and many more tedious tasks. Sassoon's gratitude emerges in his autobiography and contrasts strongly with his often resentful or distrustful attitude towards other women. Apart from his mother's eccentric friend Helen Wirgman, who won him over with her passionate piano-playing and understanding of his childish moods, Emily was the only person outside his immediate family to whom he presented his poems. His deep affection for her is a much earlier proof of his ability to relate to a woman nearer his own age

than was previously known. And his admiration for the daughter of a blacksmith shows that he was not such a snob as he sometimes seems. Siegfried's brothers' wedding present to her was a pair of copper bowls made in their workshop from the purloined catches from Weirleigh's drawing-room windows. The wedding, originally scheduled for late 1898 or early 1899, had to be postponed until January 1902. Theresa, clearly apprehensive about being left in charge of her sons without Emily, had made arrangements for the eldest, Michael, to start at boarding school in 1899. Siegfried and the youngest, Hamo, were to follow a year later. Emily's planned wedding explains what I had previously found a puzzlingly uncharacteristic decision on
the part of the over-protective Theresa — to let her sons go. By the time that Emily and her new husband Clarence Dawson, the son of a coal merchant from nearby Headcorn, left to live in Ulcombe, Kent, all three were safely off their mother's hands. Weirleigh remained precious to Emily. Her passion for gardening was inspired by its wonderful garden and the second witness at her wedding was Weirleigh's head gardener, Ned Farris. (For Sassoon, who loved the garden as much as Emily, it became a symbol of lost innocence in later life.) Theresa herself represented an ideal for Emily, not only of how to run a well-ordered household but also how to be a mother. Throughout her life she treasured Theresa's painting, Michael and Hamo's copper bowls, but especially Siegfried's little

Biography Peter Ackroyd Friends disunited
THE FRIENDSHIP: Wordsworth and Coleridge by Adam Sisman THEY HAVE BECOME A famous couple, like Hero and Leander or Pyramus and Thisbe. Their relationship was of the mind rather than of the body, but it had its comic as well as its romantic moments. For a while they needed each other; they were, in the Platonic sense, split halves of a soul that had to be reunited before it could properly manifest itself. That soul became the source of English Romantic poetry. Such a miraculous union — that of Wordsworth and Coleridge — could not last for ever. ""William has a great attachment to poetry,"" his sister Dorothy Wordsworth wrote at the very beginning of his career, ""which is not the most likely to produce his advancement in the world."" And so it proved. He merely ""passed"" at university, then set off on a series of desultory wanderings. All paths seemed to lead to France, in the middle of its bloody revolution. He cut short his hair. He fell in love with, and impregnated, his French mistress. He became a convinced democrat and radical. In this he was not
unlike a thousand of his contemporaries. One of those, two years younger, was Samuel Taylor Coleridge. He was similarly convinced of the efficacy and significance of the French Revolution. He signed one of his letters ""with the ardour of fraternal friendship"". He described himself as a ""dreamer"" and as ""fretful and inordinately passionate"". By the time he reached Cambridge he was addicted to laudanum, the drug that became the magic theatre of his life. In 1794, at the age of 24, Wordsworth told a friend that ""I have been doing nothing and still continue to be doing nothing, what is to become of me I know not"". Although he had published two poems he had, as yet, no sense of his genius. Coleridge was in a similarly disgruntled state. He had joined the Army under the pseudonym of Silas Tomkyn Comberbache to escape his university debts; he was discharged as insane before returning to Cambridge. Here he was involved in extravagant notions such as the idealised community known as Pantisocracy. Both young poets were still passionately committed to the ideas and ideals of the revolution; the ""Terror"" and the fall of Robespierre did not materially affect their enthusiasm. It had, in fact, become their faith. But otherwise they were lost in the world. They had no income, no future, no prospects to speak of. Coleridge married, and subsisted by public lecturing. Wordsworth received hand-outs
fColeridge had become a drunkard, a nuisance1
from friends and relatives. They first encountered one another in Bristol, in the late summer or early autumn of 1795. It is not perhaps surprising that there are three different and irreconcilable accounts of their meeting; so myths are made. The effect, however, was clear. They impressed each other terrifically. Wordsworth described Coleridge's conversation as ""a majestic river, the sound or sight of whose course you caught at intervals"". Wordsworth recited his poetry to his new acquaintance, which Coleridge deemed to manifest ""the union of deep feeling with profound thought"". Soon they were discussing everything — poetry, politics, plans for the future. They settled near each other in the West Country. They read each
other's works, making criticisms and suggestions. They collaborated. They declaimed aloud as they walked down country roads. They were inseparable, Coleridge spending many days away from his wife and family to be close to Wordsworth. As he put it in one of his notebooks, ""the flames of two candles joined give a much stronger light than both of them separate"". Together they created a new form of English poetry. The fruit oftheir labours in the West Country, Lyrical Ballads, was a new volume for a new age of revolution. But theirs was not a political gesture. It was a deeply creative response to the doctrines of equality and liberty promulgated by the French revolutionaries. Wordsworth and Coleridge
fWordsworth couldnft bear even mild criticism1
were relocating dignity in the commonplace, restoring grace and significance to ordinary lives where saints and heroes walked unannounced and unknown. They were proclaiming a democratic world in which outcasts had as much right to be heard as anyone, and in which women and children had a voice. The Friendship is an elegant tour d'horizon, a scholarly and charming summary of an often explored partnership. On a critical or analytical level, it is perhaps familiar; but Adam Sisman is good at recording the complicated human relationships between all concerned. There is the problem of Coleridge's wife, for example, who resented the amount of time that her husband spent with the Wordsworths. And there is Dorothy Wordsworth, caught in the difficult position of a worshipping sister. Sisman has done his research thoroughly, and is good at disentangling a confusing chronology: in this narrative the two poets march side by side on their journey towards fame and literary glory. But eventually they drew apart. There were growing differences. Wordsworth was egotistical and oversensitive; he could never bear even the mildest criticism. Coleridge, on the other hand, suffered from inanition and self-disgust. He willingly prostrated himself before his companion, comparing himself to John the Baptist before Christ. But he did not see matters clearly from that semi-recumbent
TOPFOTO
position. He let Wordsworth excise many of his poems from the second edition of Lyrical Ballads. His confidence in his poetry was wholly gone. He became ill, and took increasingly to opium. The great slide of his life had begun. When Coleridge returned to England, after a period of dithering in Malta and in Italy, the Wordsworths had never seen a man so changed. Drink and opium had glazed him; he was bloated and pale. He no longer had a commanding eye, but had become introverted and remote. Then came the final break. A mutual friend, in a fit of rashness, blurted out certain truths that Wordsworth had confided to him — in particular that Coleridge had become a drunkard and a ""nuisance"". Coleridge felt betrayed, and bitterly resented Wordsworth's ingratitude. They met intermittently over the remaining years but their intimacy — their joy in one another's company — had vanished. It is a sad story without a moral except, perhaps, for the obvious one that youthful enthusiasm and youthful friendship are bound to fade — that advancing years do not necessarily bring happiness or contentment — that the greatest careers are accompanied by a sense of disappointment. Only the work of art, as Wordsworth and Coleridge knew, is satisfyingly complete.

MICHAEI. LONGLEY Collected Poems
COLLECTED POEMS by Michael Longley MICHAEL LONGLEY IS A lyric poet with perfect pitch. His formal elegance seems effortless. In a memorable poem he suggests that a reading of his whole life's work should be by a pebbly waterfall, so that the syllables on the page might be lit in the mind's eye as if they were fireflies. Here are those words: 40 years of his poetry. Yet he is not only a songsmith; he also has a profoundly serious range of subject matten John Clare escaping from his madhouse, his father's experience of the Great War, ghettos during the Holocaust and the Troubles of his own Northern Ireland. And he can write love poetry with a tender sense of the body's richness. He filches images from the literature of classical Greece and Rome and sets them in a new landscape; they are never marmoreal. Romulus and Remus are given life as Longley imagines them licked by their she-wolf mother. In Ceasefire, Achilles is moved to tears as old King Priam weeps for his dead son Hector. He arranges for Hector's corpse to be washed and laid out in uniform. Courteous behaviour costs both Priam and Achilles
a great deal. Peace between enemies is never easy, and as Longley describes King Priam's offer of forgiveness, he must have in mind the difficulties of a recent truce .in Northern Ireland. I get down on my knees and do what must be done • And kiss Achilles' hand, the killer of my son. When he writes about the First World War I am reminded of Ted Hughes's obsession with his father's experience — except that Longley's father is more ready to tell stories than the taciturn Yorkshireman, who can hardly be brought to describe the horrors he has witnessed. Longley's Irishness is a potent inheritance. Some strands of his family tree, however, came as a surprise to me. In the first verse of his poem No Man's Land, in memory of Isaac Rosenberg, Longley writes: Who will give skin and bones to my Jewish granny? She has come down to me in the copperplate writing Of three certificates, a dog-eared daguerreotype And the one stoiy my grandfather told about her. Longley speaks of ""tilting her head"" towards Rosenberg, as if he were using this relationship to deepen his own involvement with the young poet under bombardment, which might otherwise resemble that of the bird he describes: A shell-shocked carrier pigeon flaps behind the lines. Perhaps his familial connection, however slight, gives him

a certain purchase on the Jewish experience of the Second World War. In Ghetto, for instance, one ofthe most remarkable poems in this book, he lists the ordinary and precious belongings: ""toothbrush and flannel... medicines... a candlestick, a loaf, sardines, needle and thread"" which are taken on the doomed journey for Poland. The children, forbidden lessons, record what they see in crayon: ... until in pen and ink They turned into guards at executions and funerals Torturing and hanging even these stick figures. There were drawings of barracks and latrines as well And the only windows were the windows they drew. Some of this knowledge plays out into Couchette, where his much-loved family sleep in layers, on a train, almost as if in a mausoleum. Their dreams stop and start
with the movement of the train, and suddenly he has a surreal vision of the train shunted down a siding and his whole family sleeping on for centuries, waiting to get on their way again. Longley is not exactly a modernist. He has never abandoned capital letters at the beginning of lines, though he comes to use rhyme and metre with elasticity. He knows how to break his lines wittily, as in Jelly Roll Morton, where the tip over invalidates what seemed to be words of praise: To be nearly as great as you Think you are But he is happiest with a long Ime. His work is not finished, but he is a master in an old, great tradition, and that is how he will be remembered.

r«
HO mtif&8l$^""m''.*!&.
THE LAY OF THE LAND by Richard Ford RICHARD FORD resurrects for the third time in The Lay of the Land one of the world's most eloquently idiosyncratic and anguished real estate agents. Frank Bascombe, 39 in The Sportswriter, and 44 in Independence Day, is now 55 — an age at which he hopes life has to be more predictable and thus easier to shape day by day. It's a stage he calls ""the Permanent Period"". But that was before his second wife, Sally, elopes with her first husband when he turns up after a 30-year absence. And before a siowgrowing tumour is detected in Frank's prostate gland. Suddenly the days ahead look as if they will end in mayhem. Frank lives in Sea Clift on the New Jersey shore, a few hours' drive south from Haddam, where he was in The Sportswriter. His 25-year-old former lesbian daughter Clarissa comes home to be on hand and this forms the central relationship of the novel — as the central relationship in Independence Day was between Frank and Clarissa's brother, Paul, who is still troubled after all these years. That the children of divorced parents grow up too quickly is one of Frank's many observations and features significantly in
the novel. As with the first two novels, the action takes place over a public holiday (Thanksgiving) as Frank returns to Haddam to attend a funeral, oversee a property deal with his business partner, Mike Mahoney (a Tibetan Buddhist and all-American Republican) and meet his former wife Ann, mother of their three children (one died, 21 years ago) to hear her big announcement. That is more or less all the action there is, but the great delight of this novel is not plot but Frank's richly textured, rolling and poetic voice. Not many realtors could be so vividly alive, immersed in the poetry of their trade (""high-end, a buck-twenty, per"") or so polemical. Every comment on property and land becomes a comment upon America itself. That Frank's job works so well as metaphor has everything to do with his belief that American values have all morphed into property values. Frank makes a good living selling property along the New Jersey shore, while maintaining a deep

terrorist outrage prefiguring 9/11, and a shooting do not constitute a dramatic structure and almost 500 pages of Frank's thoughts can be a little taxing. But this authorial indulgence of a favoured character is compensated by sublime characterisation, extended even to the absent. Ford populates this cathartic suburban novel in the way of Richard Yates or John Updike (the Rabbit books in particular) — with whom he shares a mechanism for amplifying daily domestic detail. The souls of his characters blossom and ultimately survive political nihilism.

COLLECTED POEMS by Alan Brownjohn ALAN BROWNJOHN HAS been a shrewd, amused observer of English life since the 1950s, when he worked alongside Peter Porter and Phillip Hobsbaum in ""The Group""; they were poets as distmstful of rhetoric as the New Movement and equally willing to accept the muting of emotion that was often a consequence of their passion for wit and precision. Brownjohn's is a dry, quiet voice. In an early poem, he confesses unromantically and without much distress: If we are still together it is because Of the need to weed the garden. This is neatly turned and not particularly sad, though another poem examines the nature of such a relationship with some grandiloquence. Our minor beings are not wide enough To let great love rear hills on their estate. Their scope includes the gesture and the sigh, But not the fire to leave them desolate. Throughout this volume, Brownjohn has an oldfashioned, quintessentially English decency, which de-
plores human spite, and all the cold unloving Acts done in the name of tribe, or god, or bank. He is at his most entertaining when he makes gentle fun of the dubious delights of a village life whose high points are the North Lancashire Ballet Group, and the acquaintance of a man who sometimes has his compositions broadcast on Radio Chesterfield. He is at his most soberly wise as he notes how changing mores took the sting, but also the significance, out of sexual infidelity: Jt was the world. No one seemed later hurt, or Finally betrayed. It was not of consequence For all the knowingness of this, something in it looks back to the resignation of those ""minor beings"" of his early poem. There are other men inside him: poor Ludlow, for instance, in A Sunday Breakdown, who walks out along a jutting wall to the sea and sits there reading The Times, waiting for the police. And there is something of Larkin's wistfulness too, as he reflects on the bushes into which he failed to drag girls, or looks across at ""real boys/ with huge muscles and girls to praise them"" in an amusement arcade and adds: And don't think they Couldn't see you trying quietly to tilt the machine. Brownjohn has been increasingly pessimistic about the uneducated vulgarity of the society around him as he has grown older: ""The polytechnics that shall inherit the earth"", the movements of popu-

lar dancing, which he finds absurd, his amazement at those who can ""sit straight-faced through a Bob Dylan lyric"". This is not, I think, snobbery. He reserves his sharpest sympathy for the long, sour ache of being poor; a woman, for instance, who longed to buy a pair of gloves, but goes home On the underground, her fingers keeping Apples and a small loaf covered in polythene. Writing in Transylvania, he reflects on what he most dislikes in the current poetry scene, to many of whose practitioners he once awarded prizes: The reason why much in-your-face poetry Doesn't appeal to veteran lags like me Is not its vein of brutal emphasis But that its custard pies too often miss. Some time in the Eighties Alan Brownjohn imagined an operatic escape on a grand
ship, followed by a return as someone else. To be enjoyable, the stuff of this daydream had to include the moment of pulling off the mask and announcing: ""It was me! It was me! This is what I had to do!"" There was never such a mask or such a departure, at least in the life of his poetry. Brownjohn has not been much influenced by the Americans, or figures from Eastern Europe, though his novels have drawn on his experience there. His tone of voice has remained* measured. His values have remained constant. Looking across to France, it is Camus — that most humane and rational of novelists — he chooses to quote, speaking through him splendidly of what he loathes most: ""The rotten spite, the tireless hates,/ The bloodlust of all men.""

A GOOD WEEK FOR POETS, THEN — and how often can you say that? If this seems unfair, don't forget Don Paterson's words of advice in these pages at the end of last month: ""Everything you've heard about poets is true: the poverty, the insanity, the early death."" But poets, as he also remarked, persist nonetheless; perhaps because they must. I've heard the writer Alan Garner say that writing is a pathology, and perhaps this is more true of poetry than any other form. The venerable Writers' & Artists' Yearbook says that poetry ""is one of the easiest writing art forms to begin with, though the hardest to excel at or make any money from"". Robert Minhinnick, the fine Welsh poet, has made some money this week, however — although, it must be admitted, for a form other than poetry. His book To Babel and Back, his latest, perceptive collection of essays, has just been made Welsh Book of the Year
— the second time that Minhinnick has taken this prize, worth £10,000; he last took it (for another set of essays) in 1993. To Babel and Back is published by Wales's own Seren, but his poetry is published by Carcanet. Carcanet is the doughty poetry publisher who took the poor Oxford poets into the fold when Oxford University Press axed its poetry list late last century, and its fine magazine, PN Review, has just celebrated its 30th anniversary with a garden party in Highgate. (It was our birthday last week, as you know, but we like to remember other people's, too.) ""Little magazines"" are the places where aspiring poets tend to send their verse — but often, as Carcanet's publisher, Michael Schmidt, has remarked, without, apparently, having read them. This is a shame, for PN Review is one of many excellent publications that still manage to exist despite a tough climate for what is often viewed as an arcane art. The London Magazine, Stand, Ambit, Modern Poetry in Translation, Poetry Review... they're out there, and worth seeking out — you don't have to be a poet to do so. A while back, I asked you all whether we should cover more poetry in Books; I was very glad that so many of you said yes.

Epic journeys to redemption .
THIS YEAR MARKS THE tenth anniversary of the death of George Mackay Brown, the shy Orkney poet whose solitary life Maggie Fergusson celebrates with an affectionate but clear-sighted biography (George Mackay Brown: The Life, John Murray, £25, offer £22.50). Read it alongside his Collected Poems and step into the ""small green world"" of the remote islands where he spent almost his entire life. ""He transforms everything by passing it through the eye of the needle of Orkney,"" according to Seamus Heaney who, 40 years after a poetic debut deeply rooted in his own rural Irish memories, comes full circle with District and Circle (Faber, £12.99, offer, £11.69). Leave the sunlit city behind you, the parks where lunchtime sunners lie ""on body-heated mown grass"" and take a Dante-esque journey down as the Tube becomes a metaphor for the underworld. This rich and ruminative collection roams through the
'Take a Dante-esque trip down the Tube'
decades, tracing the conflicts and troubles of our contemporary world on the patterns and maps of our older mythologies. It is deeply reflective and moves slowly to some vision of redemption. Simon Armitage takes the reader on another epic journey, recasting Homer's Odyssey (Faber, £14.99, offer £13.49) in a version originally commissioned for BBC Radio. It is less translation than light-
ning tour — a jaunty voyage into the land of rattling good yarns, moving at a bone-shaking pace. Scene follows swift scene. Deft metaphor replaces long description. Armitage's economic take on this classic has a forceful simplicity, a clarity and a freshness and energy that stings like the sea's salt. Billy Collins, America's former poet laureate, would understand. The Trouble with Poetry, he says in the title poem of his latest collection (Picador, £.8.99, offer £8.54), is ""that it encourages the writing of more poetry, 7 more guppies crowding the fish tank"". This popular and accessible writer takes the everyday as his subject in a series of deceptively easy poems. He engages you immediately with his colloquial simplicity when suddenly he darts around behind you, taps you on the shoulder to point out something more complex. Collins has a delightfully witty zest for life. But he has followed the same tactks for some years now, and perhaps his poems have lost some freshness. Any new volume by Geoffrey Hill merits the most mindful attention. Oblivious to the demands of popularity, he stands like some poetic legislator of our civilisation. Demanding, formidable (sometimes to the point of impenetrability), his poetry remains a touchstone in an age of mass culture. Questioning even his right to speak in his latest collection, Without Title (Penguin, £9.99, offer £9.49), he proves himself again a severe but playful master of his form. 13 To buy books at offer price (free p&p), call 0870 1608080 or visit timesonline.co.uk/ booksfirst",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0502841323/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=505615cc

Better than beautiful
Poetry Elaine Peinstein
""THE NEXT STATION IS God,"" Peter Redgrove writes in a last, handwritten, draft-of-a-poem published posthumously. And the sense of some grand, encroaching darkness is at the edge of all these very different poets. Dannie Abse, in his collection Running Late, is the least mystical, as he looks steadily at one of those grey pensioner days when the apple lies wormeaten in the wooden bowl. Yet Abse's poems are filled with wonder. Even as he resists the bells of formal religion, he remembers an idiot boy looking down at a Welsh valley, who is moved to cry ""Oh, well-done, God"". A true humanist, he writes marvellously about the lives of ""blaspheming Old Masters"" for whom ""work becomes worship"": All, all sycophants of magic, all flea bitten, mosquito bitten, lice infested Abse's gentle lyricism depends on a natural, spoken voice, and subtle thoughts always expressed with clarity. He remains one of our few great poets of married love. Ruth Fainlight's imagination is pagan: the Moon is a disturbing muse that has often visited her poetry. Here, in these rich new poems collected under the title Moon Wheels, her insomniac mind and the disk in the sky ""grind the coarse stuff of the world into poetry"". A physical object evokes a helpless sense of childhood itself. A blue Witney blanket holds the memories of many illnesses as well as her knowledge of the measles pathogens that once proved a fatal gift to the American Indians. She puzzles over plants, painting, birds' nests. Her reflections on her own ageing are set alongside rueful memories of a time when she could still ""wrap my legs behind your waist"". There are quiet poems in which a half-glimpsed other reassures and soothes. Yet the characteristic tone is a metaphysical unease, stoically borne through ordinary misadventures. One of my favourite poems here, Anxiety of Airports, is experienced both by someone waiting to welcome a friend who does not turn up, and some literary traveller left insecure and unmet in a foreign land. Her elegant new work is set alongside a section of excellent translations from Vallejo, Sophia Mello Brenner and Sophocles. The next two books demand to be read together Peter Redgrove, who died in 2003,

was one of the most astonishing figures of 20th century poetry, and the poems in this last book, The Harper, show him still dazzled by the world and equally dazzling. Penelope Shuttle was his wife, and her poems of mourning for him are among the best she has written Redgrove's imagery has the true lyric frisson of a man who finds a visionary reality in the world around him. Windows shine like gongs. Water in a well resembles ""a tree spinning silk""; he calls up ""the smell of apple mortality"". Even when he writes of magic and myth he does not lose touch with the everyday world. The seventh tree in the wood, for instance, has fruit that leaves
""a shuddering taste in the mouth"". His Duessa is a glorious figure, whose masks disguise a crone looking for a kiss, and whose odours resemble ""a hot poker plunged into a spicy drink"". He says of her, as one might say of his poetry: ""She was better than beautiful. She was magic."" The second poem in Shuttle's book Redgrove's Wife is a playful nursery game written for a wedding anniversary two years before Redgrove's death. It is a playfulness that goes to the heart of her imagery. She wishes to nuildyou a house out of Mondays and Thursdays, a boat from Fridays and Wednesdays.
Inspiration: 'Blue Gladioli', c.1929, by Chaim Soutine In her wonderful sequence Missing you — the most memorable — she begins wryly: No-one will bring you your New Scientist try to sell you double glazing or tell you their secrets. But her pain is naked. She weeps in Boots, Tesco and empty churches, finding even good luck is no longer meaningful without Redgrove. When she remembers their happiness together, she speaks of herself as a river that ""he travelled to her source"". Gradually, as she lives with his death, she begins to release parts of him but his presence continues to resonate, nevertheless, through the rest of these lovely poems.

One hell of a good job
Poetry Jamie KcKendrick
DANTE: INFERNO
translated by Robin Kirkpatrick
THE PAST TEN YEARS have brought a spate of Inferno translations. We have had Steve Ellis's Yorshire-inflected Hell, Ciaron Carson's tour de force in terza rima, still to come is Sean O'Brien's version; and that is just this side of the Atlantic. Now Robin Kirkpatrick, a distinguished Dante scholar, has published his first instalment of the entire Commedia. What is behind all this industry — apart, that is, from Dante's work being the pre-eminent long poem of the last millennium? Its entirety, compassing Hell, Purgatory and Heaven in 100 cantos, records the poet's journey through the three realms of the afterlife. Osip Mandelstam refers to the poem as a vast crystal made of 30,000 facets — a tall order, then, for any translator. What makes it harder still is that the translator must find a way not only to embody Dante's own narrative voice, but also the hundreds of utterly distinct and unforgettable voices that he records — most famously, from Hell, Francesca, Pier della Vigna, Brunette Latini, Cavalcanti (pere), Farinata, Ulysses and Ugolino. Some of the characters are mythical, others historic, others still Dante's contemporaries. In fact the afterworld, especially Hell, has much in common with the
faction-ridden world of Dante's Tuscany and, as this uninterrupted flow of translations may strongly suggest, with our own world too. The difficulties do not stop there. Stylistically, Dante is one ofthe most omnivorous of poets. Here Mandelstam's beautiful image does scant justice to the fluvial, all-inclusive, perpetually self-transforming nature of the poem. Linguistically it ranges from the most colloquial to the most courtly, from the sepulchral to the burlesque. It is unfair to expect this span from any single contemporary poet: but, doomed to failure, the translator must at least offer one strand that holds. Despite its history, the last century gave us few poems that attempt to understand
'Dante's span is beyond one single translator1
evil. Hell in Pound's Cantos merely draws on the obscene, ordure-laden elements of Dante without a convincing moral context. The Waste Land, deeply indebted to Dante, emphasises the sterile and mechanical life of the living damned without Dante's sense of their towering potential and magnetism — no Francesca, no Brunette, no Ulysses. This lack of a modern equivalent may account for the continuing challenge that Dante throws out to translators and readers. In T. S. Eliot's critical prose, Dante was fashioned into a forbidding, infallible classic. The figure we meet in the poem is
far more engaging. We may find some of Hell's punishments vindictive and repellent — those for homosexuals or heretics or even adulterers, for example — but the journey that Dante takes us on allows us to hear, though not necessarily to believe, the sinners' own versions, brought to a point of absolute selfdefinition. Kirkpatrick's introduction and canto-by-canto notes are remarkably level and lucid, as attentive to structure as to syntax, language and motif, and deftly cross-reference the whole poem. On their own, they would justify the price. He also brings a more nuanced sense ofthe Italian and a more meditated appreciation of the poem's construction than nearly all of his competitors.
Go to hell: Delacroix's vision of Dante and Virgil's journey to the Underworld
At times, however, this advantage can work against him, especially when he is tempted to gloss the original. In the opening, for example, Dante's one word smarrita becomes ""blurred and lost"", the three adjectives describing the wood become the Hobbesian combo of ""savage, brute, harsh and wild"", where the last adds little to the first. For my taste, the iambic beat is too insistent, and can lead him to fillers such as ""firmly"" in these otherwise powerful lines describing the prodigals and misers: Their frenzied sprees or febrile hoardings-up have wrung from them the beauty of the world and brought them firmly to this ugly brawl.
Earlier in the same canto, he has Virgil address Pluto as ""you execrable wolf and continues: ""May fury gnaw you inwardly away"". Dante's 700-year-old Italian sounds decidedly more contemporary. In the long run, any translation of this poem will fall short, but there is much to recommend here — certainly the intelligence, the energy, the linguistic range — and Kirkpatrick's ability to enliven even doctrinal discourse bodes well for his final two instalments.

Poetry Elaine 1'einstein From minarets to Bleecker Street
ICE MEMORY: Selected Poems by Joachim Sartorius, various translators THE RANGE OF Joachim Sartorius's poetry arises naturally from an unusual life. Born in Franconia, Bavaria, in 1946, the son of diplomat, he grew up in Tunis and was educated at the Lycee de Carthage there, thus acquiring at a stroke the culture of a civilised Arab decadence and a sharp European clarity. He draws images from minarets, street cafes or the flapping sails of Mediterranean boats with equal fluency, making use both of the Bosphorus and of the Seine, where Paul Celan drowned himself in 1970. Bleecker Street and Manhattan appear in his poetry too; but this is not poetic tourism. Sartorius is trying to make sense of the newly-understood Earth we all inhabit. In the title poem Ice Memory the frozen waters hold the residues of all the disasters from the long history of the planet: volcanic ash from Krakatoa,
lead pollution from Ancient Roman blast furnaces, and so on. Rather than meditating on the immensity of such an inheritance, however, men seem to have only one passion: the desire to discover some ""imprint of our tiny naked feet"" on the Earth's surface. The poem crackles with an ironic knowledge of human vanity. As he explores Alexandria we sense his love of Cavafy. He imagines the city in 1903, when Ramleh was a main street in the foreigners' district, before leading us into a dark alley Cavafy might have entered when he was 40. In homage, Sartorius invents three new poems that purport to be from the Cavafy estate. His own poems have a colloquial lyricism that recalls that old master of the elegaic. His imagination is often triggered by photographs, for instance one of Lilia Brik and Mayakovsky in Samarkand, and most notably in a poem for the Hungarian poet Janos Pilinszky where he evokes luminous skin stretched tightly over sharp cheekbones, as if he knew him personally, or had

shared the black truths of the lager. This is the first collection of Sartorius's poems in English, though individual poems have been appearing in magazines for some years. As a notable translator himself of American poets such as John Ashbery and Wallace Stevens, he might well have hoped this would happen earlier. He is fortunate in his translators now, however. These include Michael
Hamburger, Christopher Middleton, Michael Hulse and Rosemarie Waldrop, as well as excellent versions from Richard Dove, who is the editor of the whole volume.

"Spender, Stephen",How poetry can be found in translation,The Times,2006-Feb-11,"London, England","How poetry can be found in translation
Impossible? Or just hugely rewarding? A. S. Byatt hails the Times Stephen Spender prize
TO KNOW ANOTHER language is the best, and most exciting, way of discovering the strengths — and limitations — of the one with which one has grown up. Writing within constraints — of length, rhythm, rhyme perhaps, stress and repetition — is another. Translating poetry is famously both impossible and wildly rewarding and interesting. It is an exercise both in exact reading and in skilful writing. I have come to value my own translators as my wisest readers — they ask searching questions about precise meanings;
they hear the rhythms of long stretches of interwoven writing, they send lists of alternative translations of particular words, all of which add a little meaning in the other language here, and take it away there, all of which are possible, none of which are perfect equivalents. Sometimes they reveal things that I had not understood or reflected on, strengths and weaknesses of my English, meanings I had thought were self-evident, which become truly problematic in Norwegian, or Spanish, or Japanese. I think of translating poetry as a series of difficult decisions, one after the other. If you love a poem, you love the sound of it in the inner ear, you love the shape of it inside your head, the way each word changes all the words round it, singing or muttering or shouting. Putting it into English entails a whole series of difficult decisions — do you try to keep a strictly rhymed form,, or dq ypu go for faithful worcls
in free verse? Have you any right to add an image of your own as an equivalent image in English of some ancient Greek war cry or modern German street argot? Another delightful aspect of translating into English is the doubleness of our inheritance — we so often have the choice between Germanic or Anglo-Saxon bluntness and Latin elegance. (Both qualities can be found in the other vocabulary also of course, Latin bluntness and Germanic elegance.) Our language is flexible, craggy, sinuous, abstract, airy, rapid, ponderous — and can be discovered in all these aspects in finding equivalents for strange and unEnglish words and thought forms. The Times Stephen Spender prize for poetry in translation was created partly because its founders felt that languages were less and less taught in schools and universities, and that translated literature was less and less read and talked about! At first, for
these reasons, it was confined to translators under the age of 30.1 am glad to see that this has been changed, with splendid results. The age-range ofthe entrants in 2005 was ten to 94. Twenty-seven languages were offered, from Anglo-Saxon to Urdu, from Japanese to Tagalog, from Greek and Latin to Persian, Welsh and Esperanto. There are prizes for the young — one for 14 and under, one for 18 and under, that encourage those at school to use the skills they are learning. But there is no age limit on learning about language. A splendidly intelligent part of the prize is that translators are asked for a commentary on their poem and form of translation. These are really illuminating. The whole idea is to make us think about language, poetry, and the English language in particular. A good translator must make everything problematic and strange, and then hear the poem singing again, Witfr a djife'rence.. ^,' ,,'.,,,",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0502963864/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=4186f071

SELECTED POEMS by Carol Ann Duffy It's 21 years since the publication of Carol Ann Duffy's first collection. In that time Duffy — who last month won the T. S. Eliot Prize for her new collection, Rapture — has got under the nation's skin. Her books are taught on the school syllabus. She was a favourite for Poet Laureate. Prayer, which ends with the ordinary liturgy of the shipping forecast, is often requested on Poetry Please on BBC Radio 4. Selected Poems is drawn from her first four collections, Standing Female Nude (1985), Selling Manhattan (1987), The Other Country (1990) and Mean Time (1993) as well as The World's Wife (1999). Duffy is good at voices. She does comedy — the unimpressed teacher faced with a live poet in Head of EngUsh — and tragedy, in the agonised cry of the Middle Eastern woman in Shooting Stars. It's that capacity for the jokey crossed with serious observation that has made The World's Wife into a best seller (for poetry). But this survey also shows how she has made a voice of her own. She is excellent on desire, memory and loss. Miles Away begins simply — ""I want you and you are not here"" — attempts to conjure the imagination of the beloved, and ends with an image of self-reflection: ""The stars are filming us for no one."" Valentine is cynical — ""Not a red rose or a satin heart./ I give you an onion"" — but at its core is a truth: ""Its fierce kiss will stay on your lips,/ possessive and faithful/ as we are,/ for as long as we are."" But Carol Ann Duffy's real love is words. She likes their slippery possibilities. I had forgotten two poems collected here, both reflecting on her mother. Litany, like Prayer, makes a broken mantra out of the everyday to end with the childish error of a rude word and a mother's embarrassment. The Way My Mother Speaks distils nostalgia and pain into the chanting of two familiar phrases. In Duffy's hands poetry is both caustic and healing.

EXTREME OF THINGS by Jenny Joseph SOONER JUDGE A BOOK by its cover than a poet by his or her most famous poem: the truth is conveyed more convincingly by one chosen picture than by a chorus of excited quotation. So the image on Jenny Joseph's new volume is the bleakly beautiful Winter Sea, by Paul Nash: an ocean of great white shards, jagged slices of cold, receding endlessly towards a dark horizon which lowers with the last vestiges of sullen light. No purple garments or red headgear would keep out this cold. Nor could they ever. What would all those who twice voted Warning as ""the nation's favourite poem"" make ofthe lonely little Giacometti people on the front of Selected Poems, or the buried terracotta soldiers of Xian on the front of Ghosts, each locked in perpetual readiness to engage with death? Such jacket pictures encapsulate a poetic voice as crisp, dry and elegiac as October leaves, drifting deep in corners. ""I'm reading Jenny Joseph,"" you say. ""Who?"" they ask. ""You know — 'When I am an old woman ...'"" you prompt. ""Oh yes... T will wear purple/ And a red hat that doesn't go ...'"" they finish in triumph, relieved to be on familiar ground. This poem, about the persona she once described as ""that annoying old woman"", has been both a blessing and a curse for Joseph. As a stand-alone publication it has made her world famous,
yet it sits atop her work as might a wisp of scarlet feathers on the tormented head of beautiful, complex, black-clad Lady Dedlock. How could Joseph have predicted that this single poem, first published in 1974 when she was a young woman, would become a global phenomenon, inspiring more than 4,000 women in the United States and eight other countries to quaff wine and giggle in suitable titfers for regular meetings of the Red Hat Society? How could this most serious, oblique and accomplished poet have known that her little monologue would adorn teatowels, aprons, greeting cards, tote bags and T-shirts? Occasionally, Joseph has been prevailed on to attend a gathering of her fans; one wonders what those rollicking ladies bent on growing old disgracefully must make of the quintessentially English poet — so private and fiercely particular.* Still, Joseph's work does ""run stick along the public railings"" of the mind — challenging and often difficult. Carol Ann Duffy has said that she regrets the fact that Warning may not lead readers into the body of Joseph's work. Certainly they might admire the joyful love poetry (The sun has burst the sky and Bride to Groom) yet be daunted by the difficulty of much ofthe work. Like Duffy, Joseph often uses the device of the persona — the mask — to reveal and conceal; the influence of Browning's Dramatis Personae is clear, especially in poems such as Old Man Going (1974). Joseph's range may not be as broad as Duffy's, yet her ear for patterns of speech and thought transports her into the soul of a child as easily as that of an old man or woman. The new volume is a curious hybrid of old and new,

Alive and kicking: Joseph's bestknown poem is far behind her
brought together with reason. She has selected specific poems from earlier volumes to illuminate the new work, and the two ""halves"" are bridged by lyrics from the long-out-ofprint Persephone, which is a profound meditation on loss. The selections, concentrating as many do on perennial themes of loss and haunting, serve as a shop window for Joseph's talent, from the technical rhyming brilliance of Birth copulation death to the elemental vision of By Lake Huron in Winter, which makes
you flip back to the Nash on the cover. She begins with A chair in my house, after Gwen John, which contains two lines that perfectly encapsulate the spirit ofthis poet: ""Here I pare this little stick of words/ To keep away the crowds."" An early poem, In a dark stone, directly links to the last poem in the volume (for me the finest) Such is the sea, returning us to Joseph's preoccupations with memory, with transience and with layers of history — the detritus of existence compressed into value by
time, as insignificant shards are uncovered by an archeologist with joy. In Exody the inevitability of change, decay and grief is buffered by the Keatsian insight that knowledge, that joy and beauty are permanent, it is we who change. These poems are hauntings — revenants which console even as they force you to face the extreme.

WHAT IS POETRY FOR IF not writing about love? But that does not mean that sensibilities have to turn soppy. Carol Ann Duffy's latest collection Rapture (Picador £12.99; offer £11.69) takes the reader on an ecstatic rollercoaster: soaring and swooping and holding one's breath; hurtling, heart thumping through the complexities of human feeling before eventually slowing and finally getting off. This is a book that demands to be read from cover to cover. Individually, each poem sparkles. But together — as they run the course from first longing to final loss — they form what must be one of the most intimately intense sequences since Pablo Neruda's
100 Love Sonnets. This work is quintessentially contemporary yet tackles unflinchingly poetry's most fundamental theme. A similarly challenging vision of love lies at the core of a quirky new collection. The Tenth Muse (Carcanet £12.95; offer £11.66) is an anthology of poems by modern writers selected by the ""muse"" figures that inspired and criticised, interpreted and supported them. Elspeth Barker picks out a dozen or so pieces from the career of her late husband George; Mfanwy Thomas leafs through the repertoire of her father Edward. This collection is far more than some gimmicky poetic take on Desert Island Discs. Sometimes the sense of intimacy is so intense
that it burns. Snippets of classical wisdom are served up as conveniently as quotations in Sherod Santos's new translation Greek Lyric Poetry (Norton £15.99; offer £14.39). This rekindles the embers of verse forms that are sometimes seen as so difficult that they are left for dead. The beginner might be inspired by the simplicity and the sense of refreshed relevance, but the classical scholar will undoubtedly be enraged. If you want to tackle the poetic canon I strongly recommend Camille Paglia's Break, Blow, Burn (Pantheon Books £20; offer £18) instead. The provocative academic broaches 43 of what she considers ""the world's best poems"" with com-
bative passion, intellectual concision and a deep reverence for craft. You would definitely want her in your book club. The Collected Poems of George Mackay Brown (John Murray £35; offer £31.50), the Orkney bard, is a must-have. Living amid the ""'small green world"" of his native islands all his life, he found inspiration in the wonder of the everyday. He transforms the mundane with a luminous lyricism. He picks out his words like polished stones from the beach. The reader examines them amid the silences that his poems treasure as much as speech. In a sense, Alice Oswald could be seen as a successor to Mackay Brown. Her work is
Balm for the soul: Louis Armstrong looks after his lips in an image from As / See It: The Photographs of John Leongard (Thames & Hudson £18.95; offer £17.05)
deeply rooted in the wilds of Dartmoor where she lives. In Woods etc (Faber £12.99; offer £11.69) she throws the windows of imagination open. A fresh breeze billows in. Oswald doesn't so much capture the andscape in her poetry as set t loose. Another distinctly individual but far from traditional voice emerges as Mark Haddon follows up his Whitbread prize-winning novel The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time with a collection of poems: The Talking Horse and the Sad Girl and the Vilage Under the Sea (Picador £12.99; offer £11.69). This sly, exuberant, lugubrious, exotic collection is a mishmash of anything from lyrics through ullabies to spoofs. It in turn amuses and irritates. But it is seldom dull. For catching up with the contemporary, The Forward Book of Poetry (Forward Pubishing £8.99; offer £8.54) provides a useful annual reference. Representing anyone from the established writer to the newcomers, it points the reader in myriad directions. This year the prize for the best debut collection was awarded to Helen Farish for the tensely charged lyrics of Intimates (Cape £9; offer £8.55) while David Harsent's Legion (Faber £8.99; offer £8.54) took the prize for best collection with poems as dark and disturbing as his crime fiction. Meanwhile Michael Symmons Roberts with Corpus (Cape £8; offer £7.60) took the Whitbread Prize with a collection described as ""a poetic autopsy"" and George Szirtes the T. S. Eliot for his virtuoso performance in Reel (Bloodaxe £8.95; offer £8.54).

"Baddiel, David",'Why is Philip Larkin most novelists' favourite poet?',The Times,2005-Nov-26,"London, England","Up front Looks
David Baddiel 'Why is Philip Larkin most novelists' favourite poet?1
LAST WEEK, MY COLLEAGUE ON THIS page wrote a piece about poetry and how it functions for her as a tonic for the soul. I feel this too, but recently had my own affection for poetry challenged by the poet Nick Laird, after a panel that I was on at the Toronto International Festival of Authors, when I talked about how much I loved Philip Larkin. Nick, himself also a novelist, said to me afterwards: ""Novelists, they always love Larkin."" By which I think he was not being negative about Larkin, but was making a point about how many types of poetry there are. Novelists love Larkin because he is a narrative poet: not narrative in the Victorian, Longfellow, telling-a-story-in-185-stanzas sense, but in that he tends to describe concrete experience, things that he has seen — a tourist poster for Prestatyn, some weddings from a train, the trees coming into leaf — and then alchemises that into something larger, into poetry. He is, in a sense, prosaic, partly in his subject matter, but also in that the points he makes could be conveyed in prose; they just happen to be conveyed much more majestically in his poetry. There is, however, another type of poetry — a poetry whose greats, interestingly, are all American: William Carlos Williams, Ezra Pound, Wallace Stevens — where no one experience is described, or conceit outlined: rather the words brushstroke a mood, traverse ambiguities of meaning, and generally create an effect near to the condition of music, or maybe, following the American thought, the condition of abstract Expressionist art. From a poet's point of view, this kind of poetry is perhaps purer, in that its ""message"", for want of a better word, is not distillable into prose: it can exist only as poetry. This type of poetry can be troubling for novelists, or people — such as Tom Cox, who also wrote a piece in last week's Books about poetry, but about how he has never got it — who prefer to read novels, because, fundamentally, they don't know what it means; which of course, they shouldn't, as what the poet is trying to do is move beyond the convention of meaning. However, I also think that for me liking Larkin, and poets of his school, may be something of a reaction against the type of poetry that I wrote bucketloads of during adolescence. Here's one that made it to fhe school magazine, called Lipstick And Eye-Liner: Melancholic, Looked out of a window,
*■■'- -* '*V'*^*f'v».v/
Thought ""I hate mankind"" Realised ""Misanthrope"" And laughed. I almost broke all the windows in my house. Bollocks, of course, but that's what poetry as an adolescent is for: expressing all the bollocks in your soul. I have written poems as an adult, but I am slightly embarrassed about this — that's one of the weird things about poetry, unless you're a professional poet, even as a writer one is somewhat ashamed about it, forever tarnished by the shadow of sixth-form efforts. The way one gets round this embarrassment, I've noticed, is through versification. If I write poetry now, I try to write sonnets, as if formal technique cancels out immaturity, which it sort of does, as I'd never have bothered with all the pfaff of pentameters and ""abba""s when I was 16. Incidentally, Stephen Fry's new book, The Ode Less Travelled, puts the case brilliantly for the employment of formal techniques in the writing of verse, demonstrating how forcing your poetic message into the discipline of rhythm and rhyme will create effects in and of themselves, whatever you are trying to say. My friend Peter Bradshaw, the film critic, once did this most effectively by writing a series of ""serious""
limericks, such as this one: An Hiroshima victim called Raoul Went stumbling around in a cowl In this grim garb encased He viewed carnage and waste And felt misery and pain in his soul. What's brilliantly funny about this is that it uses only the brain's established reaction to the particular tum-te-tum of limericks to create the classically comic juxtaposition of bleak and absurd — a juxtaposition which, in this case, is simply that between meaning and rhythm. Anyway, my point is, that as you get older, perhaps one's poetic tastes move away from ""pure"" poetry and towards prose poetry, or prosaic poetry: good solid stuff, basically, where you kind of know more or less what it's about. This has certainly been the case for me, or it was, until a friend happened to show me this poem, on the website of a poet named Len Webster: Late night TV is not generally for me. The sight of Baddiel and Skinner on a set Never rouses me to ecstasy Or, at least, it hasn't yet. Yes. Now I think I might come back to believing that poetry should be diffuse, ambiguous and impossible for the average reader to understand.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0503452982/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=a5dc2d5d

THESE DAYS, EVERY pursuit has its competition — and its prize. Wannabe pop stars clamour at the gates of Pop Idol and The X-Factor, undiscovered beauties sashay down the catwalk of Britain's Next Top Model, aspiring novelists rush their manuscripts off to Richard and Judy. Next week, performance poetry joins the fray in a tournament boldly dubbed The Contenders, in which five poets will unleash their best lines at the South Bank Centre in London. The winner will walk away with £10,000 of Arts Foundation cash. When the word poetry is coupled with ""performance"", even many poetry lovers would cross the road to avoid it, fearing an unholy combination of adolescent angst, NewAge nonsense and down-withthe-kids pretension. Some
have gone further in their dislike. Discussing poetry slams — competitive events where performers have three minutes to impress the audience — the American critic Harold Bloom concluded: ""This isn't even silly; it is the death of art."" But performance poetry is exactly the opposite. The first great works of literature — the Iliad and the Odyssey — are products of an oral tradition in which poems were sung rather than written down; a tradition which also gave us Beowulf. Rhythm, alliteration, repetition (and later rhyme) grabbed the audience's attention and helped the speaker to remember their words just as they do today. The Anglo-Saxon great hall of Beowulf might seem a long way from the Get Me High Lounge of 1980s Chicago (where slam poetry originated), but those
mead-fuelled bards were just as competitive as their 20th-century descendants. Now, performance poetry is all around us: from the rapidfire urban vignettes of Dizzee Rascal, to the vaudeville revival led by clubs such as Duckie in South London, to the spudsand-specs comedy ofthe veteran poet John Hegley, (presenter of next week's competition). And that's before you get into the real ""scene"", where there are slams, gigs and workshops every day of the week. Part of its appeal, as Geraldine Collinge, director of Apples & Snakes (the organisation behind The Contenders) explains, lies in its directness: ""At the best spoken-word nights there's a unique feeling that performers and audience are all in it together."" Its roots are so diverse, she
says, that not only are the negative stereotypes wrong, but the term ""performance poetry"" is inadequate: ""When you've got Jamaican dub poets, standup comedians, Nigerian praise singers and solo storytellers rubbing shoulders, it makes for an exciting mix."" True to promise, the shortlisted poets are an intriguingly motley bunch: at The Contenders you might encounter sardonic Yorkshire wit, shocking racist violence, melodies from a thumb piano and beauty from a tea-bag. If only the same could be said for The X-Factor.

THE TALKING HORSE AND THE SAD GIRL AND THE VILLAGE UNDER THE SEA by Mark Haddon WHO WOULD HAVE thought that the stupendously original and imaginative achievement that was The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time would return to haunt its creator, Mark Haddon? It was inevitable that his next work was going to be measured against that extraordinary book, so the sidestepping involved in writing a slim volume of verse with another long streamer of a title doesn't afford as much insulation as one could have hoped for. The Talking Horse and the Sad Girl and the Village under the Sea, like most volumes of
poetry, is an uneven production: there are lyrics, sonnets, lullabies, reworkings of seven of Horace's odes from the first book; even a poetic precis of a John Buchan novel in 13 ""chapters"", a prologue and an envoi. Haddon certainly takes this new direction in his published career seriously. Poetry, he seems to be telling us, is his new vocation. The send-off that opens the book, deliberately echoing Chaucer, is both a programmatic statement of intent and purpose and a general figuring of the world of poetry and its makers. Haddon is quite taken with these occasionally metapoetical exercises: Horace's sixth ode (Average Fool; a pre-emptive, irritating piece of self-congratulatory clever-clever piece of prose called This Poem is Certificate 18; a special pleading, Poets, arguing for the privileged, precious apartness of poets, all stand evidence to a selfconscious, reflexive meditation on not just poetry but also on what constitutes a poet. It is a shame, then, that the first poem, Go, Litel Bok,
should contain the first sounding of a staccato rhythmical clunkiness that mars so many of the subsequent poems: ""The fire I have felt beneath your shirts. These cloistersJ Red mullet with honey. This surprisingly large/ slab of Perspex. Your hands are on me. But this man/ is another man."" Such short phrases and sentences, ending with a full stop, spread like an infection through the volume... That sleepless nightJ This sleepless night."" ""I walked. You walked/ ... This steak is very good. Sit down."" This. Calamitous. Linemongering. This mangling. Of end-stopped lines. Is not poetry. My other big reservation is the arch air of knowingness that hangs over the book. The allusiveness remains undigested, as a forum for showing off, never an organic, assimilated thought process driving the motor of poetry. In the transcreation of Horace's odes, the suave irony of the Augustan master has been flattened out, the pleats
of sly, slippery wit shaken out and hung out on a pedestrian clothesline, the fugitive and constantly shifting distances between voice and persona commuted to a foreclosed exercise. Various poets stalk Haddon's poems — Paterson, Doty, Kleinzahler, Farley, to name a few — but instead of singing in the unmistakably characteristic voices that they do, Haddon seems to be feeling his way still towards a tonal stability that he can make all his own. But there is much to celebrate, too. There are lyrics such as Trees, New Year's Day, Midas, where mood, tone, diction all fuse into an extraordinary bud of meaning, tight with precision and thought, waiting to unfurl into whatever shape your mind will choose to give it at any time. Great White and The River-Car manage the impossibly difficult feat of making their radiant simplicity articulate both an immediate reality and a more amorphous and indeterminate beyond or beneath. If

POETRY DERWENT MAY
Here is a remarkable phenomenon: the stiff upper lip has migrated from British army officers to women poets writing in English. Helen Farish, in her collection Intimates (Cape £9; offer £7.65), is an outstanding example. Many of her poems are about love difficulties, and she feels the pain — but she writes about it with a laconic, jesting air: preferable the flat half of the bed to your hand on my breast
one night, the next on someone else's. Her seemingly throwaway lines let the pain come through because of the subtle expressiveness of her pauses. There are also some happy love poems, with the sex in them breezy but delicate, and some unusual poems about the quiet abundance of mid-life, which she sees as being like an ocean, ""uncrashing, slowed/ by the thick coat of day on its back"". How imaginatively that embodies a comfortable human
slowness. She is a good poet. In Llfemask (Bloodaxe, £7.95; offer £6.75) Jackie Kay adopts the same tough stance towards love and its loss: The last bit of civilisation happened in the kitchen, where, however much you were bitching at me or me you, I still asked you if you wanted a cup of tea or coffee and you occasionally, not so often, asked me. She wants to live ""an eye for an eye; a kiss for a kiss"". But she often cracks and lets her emotions burst out. She is a black woman who was
adopted by Scottish parents, and the view of life which that has given her is handled here plainly and powerfully — both the strangeness of her fate and the joy and grief she has found in it. Open the anthology Tower Poets, edited by Peter McDonald (Tower Poetry, £5 from towerpoetry.org.uk), and there again, in Olivia Cole's poems, the resolutely strong note rings straight out: / stood in your shower, how many times? Well, so many times... Olivia Cole is one of seven poets here, all associated with
Tower Poetry, which emanates from Christ Church, Oxford, with the help of a legacy to the college. Everyday spoken rhythms, deftly used, are characteristic of most of these poets. Caroline Bird is witty about love: one poem begins ""I'm sorry for waking you up 12 times in one night/ to polish my flipflops"". All the other five contributors — Frances Leviston, Anna Lewis, Helen Mort, Tim Smith-Laing and Matthew Sperling — also show distinct talent. The anthology The Thunder Mutters: 101 Poems for the Planet, edited by Alice Oswald
(Faber, £12.99; offer £10.39), could not be more different. Alice Oswald is interested in poetry that ""connects the earth to our hands"". She wants the strong feel of ""nature pulling us back"" and will admit to her book none of the pastorals or nostalgic poems about the countryside that the English have so often loved. There are some excellent poems here, but certainly nothing remotely laconic. It is all creaking, pushing, shouting and singing.

""Wordsworth had a picturesque view of landscape which I hate,"" Alice Oswald once said in an interview. ""He writes about it in huge imprisoning sentences. You can only create meaning if you have physically put yourself through something."" It is this physical engagement that the reader senses in her past two volumes (the last won the T. S. Eliot Prize in 2002) and now again, in her latest work Woods etc, which will be published by Faber this month (£12.99; offer £10.39). To open the pages is an almost magical experience. Oswald throws the windows of the imagination open. A fresh breeze billows in, shaking dust from the curtains, scattering light and freshness and stirring up raptures. She doesn't so much capture the landscape in her poetry as set it loose. The reader can almost smell the ""last glow of rain dead in the ground"", taste ""the outline of ice"", hear the river's ""cloning loops its/ frays and flumes/ and vacillations and/ clings and rips/ and cloops and/ splashy cleats"". This is a poetry that seeps through the capillaries of the senses, irrigating our responses. It stirs, as T. S. Eliot — a strong influence on Oswald, would have put it — our ""dull roots with spring rain"". Guided by instinct Oswald
moves through an elemental world that is miles from the hype of postmodern urban hip. This is the realm of sea and woods and stone and stars. It is a place of aural traditions, of nursery rhyme repetitions and balladeer's rhythms, of the playful shifting patterns of quatrains and couplets. She places a fingertip on the pulse of tradition; the reader feels the quickening that proves it is still very much alive. ""This is a story of life in the age of Mandelson"" declares the dust jacket of David Herd's Mandelson! Mandelson! A Memoir (Carcanet, £7.95; offer £6.75). And, the question is, declares the writer in an opening disclaimer: ""Are you happy?"" What follows is a rambling, irreverent outpouring. This collection of poems — from a sonnet to a villanelle, from a Poundian haiku (impishly stolen) to a Japanese Noh play, from solid prose to the poetic equivalent of a scribbled Post-It note — is jumbled and energetic. They can be discursive or elliptical, formally punctilious or free as the flow of thought, chatty or terse. They are confiding but undercutting, provocative but playful, haphazard but probing. The poems offer what could either be faux homage to Mandelson or an exasperated ticking off. This ""memoir"", as its author David Herd describes it, has all the half-innocent, half-sinister air of the new Labour icon himself. As a whole it is as long and fragmented and erratically contiguous as a stream of consciousness. It is certainly self-indulgent. If you are prepared to indulge the author, you might find that you have a bit of fun. But don't expect straight answers. This rant is as lucid as a spindoctor's speech. The work In Which the Poet and his Wife Address the State of the Nation makes the point. ""And I remember thinking that you might have been right,/ But it was late,/ And your meaning escaped me."" A quiet debut is made by Hamish Robinson, currently the poet in residence at the Wordsworth Trust. In The Gift Returned (Wordsworth Trust, £5; mail order 015394 35544) Robinson displays a formal accomplishment, a mastery of rhyme and metre, a delicate susceptibility particularly to the understated domestic detail. He is not a poet who feels that he has to shout to make his voice heard. Instead, quietly confident, he speaks with a level-headed eloquence. He knows how to create the pauses which fill up with thought. But, above all, there is a feeling of directness in his form of address. It persuades the reader to listen carefully. And it is this careful listening that is Robinson's gift. El To buy Woods etc or Mandelson! Mandelson!

Philip Larkin is hardly remembered as a benignly avuncular figure. His vision was sceptical and tough. And when he focused it on himself it could be pretty unforgiving. His first three collections of typewritten poems were contemptuously destroyed. The few works that survived were scored with abusive comments. And yet, as Faber publishes his Early Poems and Juvenilia (£25; offer £20), the Larkin fan will still find that he has a pretty fat book — indeed, positively massive by the anorexic standards of his later slim volumes. Larkin in his youth was prolific; one of our leanest postwar talents was honed by near fanatical practice. Before he went up to Oxford, Larkin penned more than 200 poems in the space of three years. The shaping influences of Auden, of Yeats and Blake can be detected. And yet all the signs of an idiosyncratic development can be seen: the lack of illusion, the unconsoled outlook, the tenderness lying latent in intense observation, the loves and affections, our need for which lies implicit in so much later verse. The juvenilia of Larkin is of a calibre to make the reader question the overstuffed, second-class profusion of poetry published today. Here are works of a moving delicacy, impressionable sensibility and subtle understanding. Here are early love poems of a passion and tenderness that make you wonder if Larkin kept them in much the same spirit as the old woman keeps her love songs in his mature poem Love Songs in Age. I love the way John Burnside looks at the world. He doesn't just look: he watches. He sees into secret spaces that lie somewhere between the hidden and the revealed. In his
latest collection The Good Neighbour (Cape, £9; offer £7.65) he dwells on the question of man's place within his world and society. He traces our intricate connections with others that can somehow connect us back to our own selves again. Burnside moves like some ""shapeshifting"" shaman, ""half-flesh, half-dream"", towards an almost — but not quite — visionary apprehension. He perceives that ""wider rootedness that, as a kind/ of shorthand, we will sometimes call the soul"". But language cannot dissect sense, or paraphrase feeling. ""I know the names of almost/ nothing"" he writes in a poem written after the anatomist Vesalius. Burnside crafts a poetry as precise in its detail, as subtle in its perceptions, as respectful in its attentions as the blade of a brain surgeon's scalpel. And yet, that which it touches turns out not to be mere physical matter. He stirs strange spirits. You breathe in these poems like you breathe in an atmosphere — and then slowly ponder them before you exhale. A ""proper poet"" was apparently how G. S. Fraser praised Robert Nye. You sense what he means as you drift about in Nye's collection The Rain and the Glass (Greenwich Exchange, www.greenex.co.uk; £9.95, offer £8.96). This is a poet you know you can trust. You can hear the whisper — or sometimes the whoop — of his inspiration. You can feel his poems rising slowly up through your senses. You sense the slow fall of thoughts dropping lightly as petals. Nye can take anything from dancing hares to copulating frogs as his subject matter. He captures their spirit inside patterns and rhythms and sound. Read Words on the Wind, the opening and presumably the most recent poem in a collection that ends with his first work (and the one that informed him of his lifelong vocation). It is a delightful meditation on the threaded simplicity of the poet's life.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0503438552/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=9eefa152

Send a book instead of a bouquet. That seems to be the message as Everyman publishes a new poetry collection, Motherhood. The launch of this latest addition to its library of ""pocket poets"" has been carefully tied in with tomorrow's Mothering Sunday. The palm-sized package certainly looks likely to appeal to the gift market with its hardback binding, gold place-marker and pretty dust-jacket picture of a Mary Cassatt pastel. Inside is a mixed bunch of poems. Like the florist's selection in which the exotic and home-grown are combined through some shared colour scheme, this collection brings together under the broad thematic embrace of motherhood works as disparate as a 10th-century Japanese lament for the loss of a daughter to an impish Stevie Smith ditty. A core selection of well-known pieces — the haunting incantation of Louis Macneice's Prayer Before Birth, for instance, or Sylvia Plath's vivid Morning Song, or William Blake's dark Infant Sorrow — are the showy blooms around which a number of lesser-known works cluster. Here, for instance, are the sort of poems which tend not to make it into period collections. Lady Elizabeth Egerton's On My Boy Henry, is a heart-rending 17th-century commemoration of a lost baby which, though it borrows heavily from a more famous work by Ben Jonson, somehow seems all the more tender precisely for that. Or here is Augusta Webster struggling in the elaborate language of her Victorian era to evoke complex maternal feelings. The principal emphasis, however, is on the modern and contemporary — with a strong American slant. Here is a range of richly perceptive, sharply observant and often almost painfully sensitive poems that include Anne Sexton's jubilant evocation of
the security of the mother's lap, ""your legs that bounce me up and down,/ your dear nylon-covered legs"" to Eric Ormsby's slightly perturbing description of the clipping of his grandmother's toenails, ""scissoring the wrinkled horn of nail/ with snipping shears until the pale/ translucencies of toenail ribboned off"" to Chinua Achebe's lacerating portrait of a Mother in a Refugee Camp. But this book has the same problem as that bunch of flowers in the corner shop tomorrow. It needs weeding. It has been padded out with the literary equivalent of gypsophila. In the attempt to represent a few more famous male writers a terrible Thomas Hardy has been included, for instance. Ted Hughes is at his worst. If editors wanted to represent him why didn't they choose his bewitching Full Moon and Little Frieda? Focus on the strongest pieces — on works such as George Barker's To My Mother, a poem as vivid and bold and direct as a bunch of bright daffodils plucked squeakyfresh from the garden and plonked down in a jam jar on the kitchen table.

the number of volumes of poetry published rises annually. Perhaps these facts are not unconnected — readers may well be daunted by such an abundance of new collections. One place to start is Newborn by Kate Clanchy (Picador, £12.99; offer £10.39). These vivid, tender poems form a lyrical alternative to all those bossy childcare manuals. The collection flows like a novel through conception, pregnancy and birth — capturing the gradual but ineluctable changes that come with motherhood. Snow Leopard by Ruth Padel (Chatto and Windus, £7.99; offer £6.79) is, for me, her best collection to date. The Amer Leopard of the eponymous poem pads through a failed relationship along Wardour Street by way of Aztec temples and Beauty and the Beast.

It will have to beat The Tree House by the Scottish poet Kathleen Jamie (Picador, £8.99; offer £7.64), which has already collected the Forward Prize. Jamie's book deals with our edgy, vital, fragile relationship with the environment symbolised by the Tree House ofthe title — a place where human culture perches on the edge of the natural world. At once lyrical and disturbing, this is one book that deserves to break through the ""poetry barrier"" and reach the widest possible audience. The 40th anniversary of Rachel Carson's book about the effects of DDT, Silent Spring, has provoked an anthology called Wild Reckoning edited by John Burnside and Maurice Riordan (Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, £7.50; offer £6.38). This disconcerting collection pulls together poems about the essential fragility of the natural world, from Wordsworth's nimbyish rant
On the Projected Kendal and Windermere Railway to Primavera, a specially commissioned poem by Robin Robertson on the accelerating effects of global warming on the seasons. Our place in the world and the sense of perspective that comes from observing nature is a perennial theme of the American poet Mary Oliver whose selected poems, Wild Geese, are published by Bloodaxe (£7.95; offer £6.76). Her sardonic poem Farm Country is the best description of the reality, as opposed to the Country Living ideal, of rural life that I know. Equally dark are the New and Selected Poems of Dennis O'Driscoll (Anvil, £11.95) whose work in the Irish Customs and Excise has resulted in some mordantly funny poems about the ecology of the office.

The spirit of Ted Hughes resonates in Arvon's prize anthology
The man who won the Arvon International Poetry Prize (and £5,000) on Tuesday night was Joe Kane, a softly spoken, bearded ceramicist from Donegal. He said he had Ted Hughes to thank for his success. Kane had been in his bathroom reading a book by Hughes, aimed at teenagers, in which the poet advised tiie use

The spirit of Ted Hughes was everywhere that night; inevitably because he was a champion of Arvon, a charity dedicated to the encouragement of writing, but also because in the room was his old friend Nick Short, a former chairman of the Duncan Lawrie Bank, which sponsors the competition. Short and Hughes often fished together and Short, now in his seventies, recalled a bitterly cold winter's day when the two of them were joined on the river bank IfJbyiMichael Hprdern.' -_• \
""Ted got something on his line,"" recalls Short, ""and then handed it to Michael to land who said, 'My God, it's frozen solid.'

POETRY RACHEL CAMPBELL-JOHNSTON Writing in tongues The Times Stephen Spender prize for a poem in translation has produced startling results
Today The Times celebrates new poetic talent by announcing the winners of the Times Stephen Spender prize. This annual award for poetry in translation was launched this year to encourage a new generation of writers to pursue the path that Spender took when he made the imaginative worlds of Schiller and Rilke accessible to non-German speakers through his skilled and sensitive translations. ""Judging a poetry competition is a tricky task,"" said Susan Bassnett, Professor of Comparative Literature at the University of Warwick and one of the four judges. ""But judging a poetry-in-translation competition is even trickier."" The new works have to be weighed against the originals so that the translators' strategies can be assessed, the authenticity of their final product appraised. The breadth and the calibre of the submissions were impressive — sending a message of hope, Bassnett suggests, to beleaguered language teachers. The winning entries, from Latin, Anglo-Saxon, French, Russian, Italian and Romanian, were decided on by a remarkable consensus that bears testimony to their quality. Mark Leech, the winner in the over-18 category, chose that finest of Old English religious poems, The Dream ofthe Rood. Preserving a sense ofthe original's ancient mystery and a feeling for its alliterative muscle, he captures the terse intensity of the Rood's address to the dreamer while loosening
the original's rigid metrical patterns to make the poem clearer, more accessible. ""My only regret,"" he said, ""is that the strict rules I set myself prevented me from experimenting more with the verse in order to explore different aspects of its meanings."" In the 18-and-under category J. C. H. Potts won for his translation from the Latin of the impassionedly decadent, frenziedly psychological Poem 63 by Catallus. This tells ofthe demise of Attis, so handsome that his grandmother Cybele desired him, warning him never to marry because she wanted him for herself. When Attis fell in love with a king's daughter, Cybele was possessed by If IS THE Alii OF such insane jealousy that she made him mad, sending him running, deranged, through wild mountains where, eventually, he castrated himself. ""The impact of the original — and the hardest aspect totranslate — is the way it recreates through sound and imagery the Bacchic dance, with its interlinked motifs and connotations of frenzied, orgiastic, drugged-up, esoteric rites,"" Potts said. Influenced by Seamus Heaney's Beowulf, he said, he chose to render Catallus's verbal effects ""in an alliter-
ative, almost Anglo-Saxon style, trying to capture some of the frenzy and dislocation of the Original with tortured polysyllables, harsh alliteration and compression from 16 syllables to the five-stress sprung line to vary pace and metre"". The runners-up were: Adrian Pascu for a piece that introduces us to tiie poetic craft and ironic sophistication of the Romanian writer Ion Minulescu; Holly Hughes for her flowing rendition of Victor Hugo's Tomorrow, at Down; Paul Howard for his dialectical version of the work of a practically unknown Italian, G. G. Belli; and Sasha Dugdale for the intricate clarity of her translation of Elena Schvarts's Memory's Sideways Glance from the Russian. To translate amounts to far more than a mere understanding of vocabularies and grammatical constructions. The most inspired should be hailed as poets in their own rights. ""With Poesie to open Poesie"" was Chapman's declared aim as he first approached Homer. The best translations demand not only attention to grammar and syntax, to rhythms and forms; they involve ah intricate and subtle interweaving of identities a sense of complicity and almost mystical connection. A translation is a resurrection, notjust ofthe body, but ofthe spirit of the work.

ANDREW MOTION
The best thing we can say about the index to a poetry anthology is that it's reliable. But the index to Being Alive does more than that it quietly advertises one of the mysteries of late 20th-century poetry — by putting, after the name of the contributor Rosemary Tonks, ""b. London, 1932: disappeared 1970s"". Disappeared! What happened? Because I admire her poems, I've been tying to find out for years. She published some fiction and two collections of poems during the late-middle of the century, lived in Hampstead for a while, then... Well, according to some people she became a Sufi. Others say she entered a closed order. Others imagine her footloose and anonymous, travelling the wide world. In any event, no trace of her seems to survive — apart from the writing she left behind. It's a bewitching story, and seems all the more fascinating for the challenge it makes to our cult of celebrity. Not only that the poems are seriously interesting, too — often Frenchified and/or fruity, hectic, and with a strangely irritable eroticism. Story of a Hotel Room is a good example. If enough editors put her in their anthologies a publisher might re-issue her collected works. It would be worth it she's a distinctive and authentic voice They might even track her down — if she's still alive, and willing to be found again. Andrew Motion is the Poet Laureate. His novel The Invention of Dr Cake is published by Faber Story of a Hotel Room By Rosemary Tonks Thinking we were safe — insanity! We went in to make love. Ail the same Idiots to trust the little hotel bedroom. Then hi the gloom... ... And who does not know that pair of shutters With the awkward hook on them All screeching whispers? Very well then, in the gloom We set about acquiring one another Urgently! But on a temporary basis Only as guests — just guests of one another's senses. But idiots to feel so safe you hold back nothing Because the bed of cold, electric linen Happens to be illicit... To make love as well as that is ruinous. Londoner, Parisian, someone should have warned us That without permanent intentions You have absolutely no protection — If the act is dean, authentic, sumptuous, The concurring deep love of the heart FoBows the naked work, profoundly moved by it.

Dorothy Nimmo's poems are wicked and precise, funny with a kind of terror that comes as an aftertaste. She worked often with the rhythms of our childhood reading — hymns, fairytales, nursery rhymes — and those rhythms give her work a tautness and edge sometimes missing from female anger. Behind this poem Bluebeard and the ogre lurk, and the ambiguous gifts of witches and fairies. But it is also very modern, with its C-cup and bodypiercing. The listed things, black lace, strawberries, bloodstone, little house, gold rings, are both solid and symbolic in an entirely satisfactory way. The voice of the poem is interesting — an impersonal, ironic teller of tales. The poem is exciting, not depressing, because the poet has got the better of both the anonymous ""he"" and the situation in general. A. S. Byatt's The Little Black Book of Stories is published by Vintage Good Gifts By Dorothy Nimmo He gives her a black lace bra: her heart swells. She fills the C-cup. He gives her a bottle of champagne costing £24.50. He has got a bargain. He gives her a basket of strawberries. Open wide! he says, gently. She opens. He gives her a smooth round bloodstone to wear round her neck. So cold. He gives her a little house. All day long she cleans his fingerprints from the paintwork. He gives her five gold rings, one in her ear, one in her nose, one in her nipple, one in her navel, one in her finger. He takes a fine gold wire and threads it between ear, nose, nipple, navel and finger. He twitches the end. She dances. © Dorothy Nimmo Estate.

SHIRLEY MANSON
It's a chilly Sunday in late October and I'm living and working in the United States of America, a country I have grown to love as if it were my own yet never have I been more aware that I do not belong here. In nine days' time the US is to hold a general election in which as a resident alien I shall have no vote. I am completely disenfranchised and yet my future and indeed that of the rest of the world will be severely affected by the result. I am left feeling fearful and fretful and wonder at times if the US is already set upon a course that cannot be reversed. Lately my disgust with US foreign policy has left me feeling impotent and indignant and I am driven to seek solace in music, in paintings and in words. This particular poem eloquently articulates the contradictions in humankind and brings into focus the predicament of the bewildering chaos I am struggling to understand. Shirley Manson is the lead singer of the pop band Garbage. They are working on a new album to be released next year What Happens By Erich Fried It has happened and it goes on happening and will happen again if nothing happens to stop it The innocent know nothing because they are too innocent and the guilty know nothing because they are too guilty The poor do not notice because they are too poor and the rich do not notice because they are too rich The stupid shrug their shoulders because they are too stupid and the clever shrug their shoulders because they are too clever The young do not care because they are too young and the old do not care because they are too old That is why nothing happens to stop it and that is why it has happened and goes on happening and will happen again Translated from the German by Stuart Hood. © Erich Fried Estate, 2004.

POETRY RACHEL CAMPBELL-JOHNSTON Poems by the plateful
Of soup and love, the first is the best, an 18th-century pragmatist confidently declared. Certainly, if the stomach is not satisfied, the feelings tend to flag. There is definitely a reason why it should so often be suggested that the way to the heart is through the digestive tract. ""She knew that the best feelings must have victual,"" as Byron said of Don Juan's dark-eyed lover, ""and so she cook'd their breakfast to a tittle."" But browse through the poetry section of your local bookshop and for all the dozens of volumes devoted to amorous musings, there may well not even be one given over to the pleasures of culinary pursuits. Metaphorical links between corporal consumption and cultural inspiration, between physical and spiritual sustenance are longstanding. Plato writes in Republic that poetry ""nourishes our worst parts"" because it ""feeds and waters the passions that should be allowed to wither away"", while Sir Philip Sidney in The Defence of Poesy counter-argues, calling poetry ""food for the tenderest stomach"", describing it as the ""first nurse, whose milk by little and little enabled"", comparing it to a ""cluster of grapes"" or ""a medicine of cherries"". Poets across all generations and cultures have celebrated the satisfactions of food. Ben Jonson coaxes a friend to supper with -poetic promises of capers and mutton and shortegged hens to tickle the palate. Sidney Smith suggests a mouthwatering recipe for salad, begging ""The pounded yellow of two hard boiled
ABPL I
eggs;/ Two boiled potatoes, passed through the kitchensieve"", ""onion atoms"", ""mordant mustard"" and a ""magic soup-spoon of anchovy sauce"" to confect the sort of ""herbaceous treat"" that ""would tempt the dying anchorite to eat"". Anything from bamboo shoots (""the purple skins broken — like an old brocade"" as the ancient Chinese Po Chu-I describes them) to blackberries (""as big as the end of your thumb/ Real sky-blue and heavy, and ready to drum/ In the cavernous pail of the first one to come"" as Robert Frost puts it) can provide the food for poetic meditation. This year, National Poetry Day, which takes place on October 7, whets the appetite for poetry by taking food as
its theme. As events are organised all over the country, there will be ballads for breakfast and lyrics for lunch, couplets for tea and stanzas for supper. There will be rhymes in restaurants and pentameters in pubs. If you are lucky you might even hear a bit of ottava rima down at the market or a few lines of blank verse coming from the cow byre as John Hegley takes up residency on a farm. All over England poetry will be served up on a plate. So prepare, as Robert Browning put it, to ""munch on, crunch on, take your nuncheon,/ Breakfast, supper, dinner, luncheon"".

"Dalrymple, William",Land of the free,The Times,2004-Sep-04,"London, England","review books
Baghdad enjoyed an enlightened, tolerant rule as the glittering capital of the ancient Muslim world. William Dalrymple examines a paradox
Land of the free
Baghdad is not a place one automatically links with philosophy, learning, poetry, literary criticism or cutting-edge science. Nightly news bulletins showing bombed and shrapnelmarked buildings, shabby backstreets and unshaven youth firing mortars at each other have given the city a quite different set of associations. Yet just as Gaza was once a Byzantine port of fabulous richness, so Baghdad was once the sophisticated capital of the Muslim world at a time when the Caliph ruled from Tunisia to the Indus and presided over a court culture more brilliant even than that of Constantinople. The Abbasid rulers, who founded Baghdad in AD762, have a good claim to be regarded as one of Islam's greatest dynasties: certainly this seems to be the view of Osama bin Laden, whose ultimate aim is the re-establishment of the caliphate. The publication this month of a remarkable narrative history of the Abbasids is thus a major event and should be required reading for the Washington neocons and their Islamist theocon adversaries. Professor Hugh Kennedy's lively and compelling study, The Court of the Caliphs, shatters many of the preconceptions held by both sides and gives some indication of the roots of our current impasse. On one hand, the book presents a picture of a tolerant, cultured and pluralistic Islam that effortlessly salvages and absorbs the learning that survived the wreckage of both Classical and Persian antiquity. On the other, amid this busy scholarship, Kennedy sketches a looming conflict with the clerical establishment that eventually succeeds in closing down whole avenues of speculative theological and philosophical thought, so setting the stage for the current clerical veto on what is and is not permissible in the intellectual life of Islam. The consequences of that defeat are still with us. Sir Steven Runciman, arguably the greatest medievalist of recent times, believed that the real heirs of Roman civilisation were not the chain-mailed knights of the rural West, but the
sophisticated Byzantines of Constantinople and the cultivated Arab caliphate, both of whom had preserved the Hellenised urban civilisation of the ancient world long after it was destroyed in Europe. It followed, said Runciman, that the Crusades should be under¬
stood less as an attempt to reconquer the Christian heartlands lost to Islam so much as the last of the Barbarian invasions. Certainly, as Kennedy's narrative unfolds, it is easy to see the degree to which Abbasid science and thought grew directly from Classical Greek and Roman roots. Although the Abbasids moved the heart of the Islamic world east, away from the old Ummayad capital .of Damascus, where the bureaucracy still operated in Byzantine Greek, they had no doubts about the importance of studying the works of Classical antiquity, in striking contrast to Byzantium, where pagan philosophers were often regarded as rather dangerous, heretical figures.
THE GREAT IS THE CAL nrlUTAWWA NARROW-M CRUEL SAD
According to the Hadith, or Traditions, the Prophet had commanded his followers to ""seek knowledge, even unto China""; and it was an instruction that the inquisitive Abbasids took literally. They sent secret agents to Byzantium to buy up Greek manuscripts on astronomy, science, botany and medicine and then smuggle them across the border. Once in Baghdad, the works of Hippocrates, Aristotle, Plato, Euclid and Galen were eagerly translated into Arabic often via Syriac, with the Christian communities of Mesopotamia acting as the conduit. The position of Baghdad at the crossroads of trade routes leading to Persia, India and China meant that the learning of the Arab capital was also cross-fertilised by the ancient learning of the East Yet, as Kennedy makes clear, the Abbasid court was a lively place. Poetry was highly valued, and Abbasid poets appear to have been as drunken and disreputable as literary figures in any age — falling inebriated off rooftops, composing scurrilous ditties and expiring under collapsed piles of their books. Abbasid poetry was often set to music, in direct contravention of the strictures of the more puritanical schools of Islamic thought and was accompanied by the lute, an instrument of Arabic invention: the English word derives from the Arabic al-ud. Those modern Islamists who imagine the Caliph's court as a place of puritanical propriety would be shocked by the outpourings of poets such as Umar ibn Abi Rabia, who is chiefly remembered for his descriptions of picking up girls during the Hajj, even as they walked around the Kaaba itself. There was also a great deal of versification on the delights of attractive young boys and impassioned debate as to whether such pleasures exceeded those of the harem. Another important writer at the court was Ibn al-Shah al-Tahiri whose oeuvre included works on Trie War of Bread and Olives, Adultery and its Enjoyments, Stories about Slave-boys, Stories about Women and a work simply called VILLAIN IPH IOL, A MINDED, D! G * B n M Masturbation. As Kennedy succinctly summarises his output: ""Basically, he was concerned with food and sex."" Such developments were made possible by the prevailing liberalism of the dominant Mutazalite theology. The Mutazalites believed that the Koran had been created at a certain point in time by God. This was opposed to the rival view which taught that the Koran was eternal. Though this may seem a small distinction to us, this obscure theological controversy has had huge repercussions. As Kennedy explains: ""If the Koran was created, then it could be interpreted and even, conceivably, modified by new revelation or human investigation to suit changed circumstances. However, if it had existed throughout all eternity, it clearly had an absolute and universal status that could not be challenged in any way."" The great villain in this story is the mid-9thcentury Caliph Mutawwakil: a cruel, narrow-minded sadist who not only did away with much of his court and army in a series of Stalinesque purges, but who also imposed restrictions on the caliphate's Christians and Jews, who had flourished under Islamic rule. More damagingly still, he abandoned the freethinking spirit of the Mutazilites, so discouraging philosophy and in particular the study of the secular sciences. The historian Masudi, writing a century later, was clear about the change: ""When Mutawwakil succeeded the caliphate, he ordered the abandonment of investigation and discussion and debate and everything which people had enjoyed in the days of [the previous caliphs]. He ordered submission and the acceptance of tradition."" Today, many modern Islamic reformers look back to this change in 9th-century Baghdad as a crucial wrong turning in Islamic intellectual history. Indeed some, such as the leading Indonesian scholar Harun Nasution, have tried to reintroduce Mutazilite ideas in an attempt to free modern Islam from the theological dogmatism that they believe has stunted its development and allow it to embrace the full modem range of philosophical mquiry. So far, such attempts have met a mixed response: when the Egyptian linguistic scholar Nasr Abu Zied recently suggested that some parts of the Koran might be better understood as allegories rather than as literal fact he was quickly accused of blasphemy. After a bizarre court case when an Islamist sheikh tried to get Dr Abu Zied forcibly divorced from his wife on the grounds that he was no longer a proper Muslim, the couple eventually fled to the Netherlands where Dr Abu Zied now teaches. When I went to see him in Cairo just before he left, he was deeply depressed. The Islamists, he said, ""want to suppress rational thought they won't let anyone oppose them"". But he had no intention of backing down: ""This,"" he said, ""is a battle which had to be fought"" Seen from this perspective, the defeat of the Mutazalites is the great failure of the Abbasid period; but it is not a failure that is irreversible. Moreover, it should be recognised that even Mutawwakil, the most
<NEWPAGE>
monstrous Abbasid Caliph, had a more liberal attitude to other religions than most of the monarchs of the medieval West. He forced clothing restrictions on the caliphate's Christians and Jews, yet even he still had a Christian as his secretary. Other Abbasid rulers had a better record, and Kennedy's book is full of prominent Christian and Jewish scholars, translators, courtiers and generals. Though by modern standards Muslims and Jews — the dhimmi — were often treated as second-class citizens, there was at least a kind of pluralist equilibrium (what Spanish historians have called convivencia or living together) which had no parallel in medieval Christendom. Such pluralism arguably reached its climax in Islamic Spain, where Muslim, Christian and Jew lived and worked together in an atmosphere of creative tolerance: indeed it was probably through Islamic Spain that such basic facets of Western civilisation as paper, the pointed arch, ideas of courtly love and the abacus passed into Europe — the same route as taken by many of the Greek and Roman classics, lost in the West but carefully translated in Abbasid Baghdad and passed on to the libraries of alAndalus. After the conquest of Granada, however, this creativity was lost: the Catholic kings promptly expelled most of the Moors and Jews, and let loose the Inquisition on those — the new Christians — who were converted. There was a similar pattern in Sicily. After a fruitful period of tolerant coexistence under the Norman kings, the Muslims were later given a blunt choice of transportation or conversion. This forgotten Islamic pluralism is the theme of another important book to be published this month: Mark Mazower's wonderful Salonica, City of Ghosts. Mazower follows the fate of the expelled Spanish Jews as they flourished in their new Ottoman home, a city where ""as late as the First World War Salonican bootblacks commanded a working knowledge of six or seven languages"". As Mazower shows, Salonica's hybrid ""multi-confessional, extraordinarily polyglot Ottoman"" multiculturalism survived until imported European ideas of the nation state irreparably shattered the mosaic. Pluralism slowly gave way to polarisation as Muslims came to be seen as Turks and Christians as Greeks. The final chapter came in 1943 with the arrival of Western Christian troops in the form of the Nazis. If the Catholic kings expelled the Spanish Jews from Europe, the Nazis deported them back westwards again — to Auschwitz. Forty-five thousand Salonica Jews — a fifth of the city's population — died in the gas chambers. Today, as we watch the anarchy unleashed in Baghdad by the American invasion, the works of Kennedy and Mazower should give us pause for reflection on the deeper roots of the current mess. As these books show, there are many Islams, just as there are many forms of Christianity. If there is a clash of civilisations taking place, it is happening as much within the Islamic world as between East and West. Islam has long and proud traditions of pluralism, moderation and religious toleration. The disaster is that by
our current heavy-handed and illegal actions in the Middle East, we seem to be liberating the extremists, radicalising the unaffiliated and making life more difficult than ever for our natural allies: ordinary, decent, moderate Muslims.

POETRY TOM PAULIN Anxiety in a jawful of marl
Elizabeth Bishop and Robert Lowell were close friends, never lovers. Then one day, quite unexpectedly, he proposed marriage to her. Wisely, she refused him and their friendship survived. Lowell admired her work enormously and wrote perceptively and sensitively about her poems. In his admiration for her work, there is a current of all-toonuman anxiety: he is the most famous poet of their generation; indeed he is the dominant poei in the English-speaking world, but perhap.-: she i:; better than him? It is invidious to set up hierarchies oi' talent. •.■""a: reputations mc ciianse ■•v.::- am;, a:- reader:- an.- rniies. perhaos. grow wisrv in the 1960> ana the ear.-. 70s, i read Lowell — we ail di-;'. — and it was only the aisa-.- nointment of his ias: three volumes thai made me turn awav from him. "" turned to Elizabeth Bishop at tfte same time as I discovered three other poets — Emily Dickir.- son. John Clare and Christina Rossetli — with whom Bishopshares a central theme that 1 would call dwelling-in-theworid or ontological anxiety. Her images for this subject are oil-stained gas station forecourts and workshop floors, or the smell of gasoline left behind when the moose and a coach full of passengers meet in one of her most famous poems, Trie Moose. That poem is partly a gentle and ironic tribute to Robert Frost (it begins north of Boston), and like all her poems it has a distinctive ""sentence sound"" — the term is Frost's description of the vernacular speaking voice in poetry, a voice that is intimate, direct, touching, and which refuses heroic rhetoric. Bishop has now the reputation of being one of the finest, most formally perfect poets of the second half of the 20th century. Poets such as Seamus Heaney, Anne Stevenson, Paul Muldoon and Craig Raine have testified to the subtlety and complex beauty of her work. She has been called a poet's poet, but she is also preeminently a reader's poet, and a poet whom it is always a serious joy to teach — students come alive when asked to discuss her work, partly because she communicates with an eager, unforced directness, partly because of the wit pizazz and styie with which she writes. in the 1980s there was li certain resistance to he- work: she never came out as r iesnian.

She designs i iHVI ;<\.«&r beautiful cadences, perfect shapes, and then she runs a counter-theme against them: ugliness, bad taste, rough or broken surfaces and sounds infiltrate her paradise of pure form and make it both more ideal and more real. In Cape Breton, she draws our attention to the weaving ""silken water"" and then offsets it with ""hackmatack"", the name of a hard American spruce much admired by Walt Whitman. She also introduces an ""irregular, nervous sawtooth edge"", and a ""roughedged pole"". A gifted amateur
?&--
painter, she designs a composition which plays the rough against the smooth, and allows a coded unhappiness and anxiety to disturb the surface of her art. Bishop's personal life was often unhappy — two lovers committed suicide — and she became an alcoholic as a young woman. Behind the formal facade of her poems there is a homeless, orphaned imagination whose loneliness was expressed in her insatiable letter-writing and in late-night telephone calls to friends. She was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, on February 11, 1911. Her mother was from Nova Scotia; her father, who was half Canadian, half American, died eight months after she was born. Her mother became disorientated over the next five years, was diagnosed as insane in 1916 and died in a public sanatorium in 1934. Bishop lived alternately with her grandparents in Nova Scotia and New England, and later with an aunt. She had poor health and hadn't much formal education until she was 15. In 1930 she went to Vassar College and joined a brilliant generation there. Bishop impressed everyone she met — she was musical, well read, and was also a painter with a great knowledge of the visual arts. She was a compulsive traveller who manages to avoid all the pitfalls of tourist verse. Unusually, it is to a single academic essay that we must turn to to understand Bishop's idea of form and beauty. As an undergraduate she read Trie Baroque Style in Prose by M. W. Chroll — one of the classic essays on prose style (it can be found in a collection called The English Language, edited by George Watson). Croll's concept of baroque style — ""not a thought, but a mind thinking"" — spoke to Bishop like a vocation. She quoted Croll's essay in letters to friends because what she admired in the baroque was the ""ardour"" and dramatic energy and the immediacy of an idea as it was formulated and experienced. The result is a poetry of intense visual and vocal power, where the rhythm, rhyme, spoken inflection and carefully composed images have both spontaneity and deft authority. Their perfect cadences create that ""unique feeling of timeliness"" which she sought and admired in poetry.If we look at The Bight we can see how finely her imagination works. Bishop was also a gifted short-story writer (her collected prose has been published), and a marvellous translator. Many of her translations came out of the 15 years she spent in Brazil, where she moved in 1952 to live with Lota de Macedo Soares. She moved back to New York in 1967 and Lota killed herself later that year. Though Bishop continued to travel, she based herself in Boston and died there on October 6,1979. She is one of the greatest American poets of the last century and is the subject of many books. Twenty-five years after her death her work continues to be deeply influential.

POETRY RACHEL CAMPBELL-JOHNSTON Found in translation
An important new literary prize is launched this month. The Stephen Spender Memorial Trust, in collaboration with The Times, inaugurates the Times Stephen Spender Prize for poetry in translation — by poets aged 30 or under. Spender was himself a subtle translator, praised for, among other things, his reworkings of Leishman's translations from Rilke and his free adaptation of Schiller's Mary Stuart. This new award aims to encourage a new generation to pursue the same skilled and sensitive path. The prize will be judged by Daniel Weissbort, founder (with Ted Hughes) of Modern Poetry in Translation; Alan Jenkins, the deputy editor of the TIS; Susan Bassnett, Professor of Comparative literature at the University of Warwick; and Ewald Osers, the poet and translator. ""WTiy?"" some might wonda. Aren't our literary traditions already rich enough? Do we need more outsiders? Why not promote originality instead? Quibbles trip from the tongue as glibly as Robert Fro&'s all too famous dictum: ""Poetry is what is lost in translation."" And Nabokov's wellknown put-down is nothing if not disheartening: What is translation? On a platter A poet's pale and glaring head, A parrot's screech, a monkey's chatter, And profanation of the dead. But there are strong counter-arguments. Our literary traditions are indebted to outsiders. Many classics, The Riad, The Odyssey, the Bible, for instance, all entered our culture through translation. Our greatest poets were often responsible. And the art of translation (to use Dr Johnson's phrase) helped to ""tune their tongue"". A golden era of poetic translation began almost half a millennium ago when Surrey's Aeneid introduced blank verse into English, when Golding's Metamorphoses became one of Shakespeare's favourite books, when Horace and Martial were disdplining the style of Ben Johnson who in turn laid the foundations on which Dryden stood. And it was Dryden who, through engagement with the andents (Horace, JuvenaL Persius and Virgil), forged a poetic language tiiat remained fundamental to a modem view of literature. ""What was said of Rome, adorned by Augustus,"" dedared Dr Johnson, ""may be applied by easy metaphor to English poetry embellished by Dryden, fateritiam invenit marmoreamretiquit, he found it in brick, and he left it in marble."" The art of translation waned somewhat during the Romantic period (witii a

notable exception in Shelley, whose stylistic intricades are indebted to his versions of Dante, Calderon and Goethe). But with the contemporary it has entered a new golden age. Worics that, with the decline of a dassical education, had fallen silent are redaimed in a freshly relevant idiom Christopher Logue catches ""a light that screams across three thou.sand years"" in his fragments of The Iliad. Ted Hughes captures Aeschylean cruelties in his harrowing Oresteia. And without Seamus Heaney's Beowulf, the Old English that for centuries has provided a linguistic bedrock would be in danger of disappearing. English has become a world language. Hundreds of voices would lose their audiences if it wasn't for translation.

POETRY RACHEL CAMPBELL-JOHNSTON Uproar in New York
English poetry was languishing in the Fifties. The Movement poets, united by nothing more bracing than ""a negative determination to avoid bad principles"", seemed beset by a genteel sobriety. Their verse, in the words of Al Alvarez, was ""academic, administrative ... polite, knowledgeable, efficient, polished and, in its quiet way, even intelligent"". But it was hardly likely to inspire a new generation, or to open poetry up to insight and experience and innovation. Modernist experiment had lost its impetus. It was slowing to a sludgy stop. But across the Atlantic, creativity was on a roll. The New York art scene, a unique foment of ideas and people, was flourishing. This was the era of Abstract Expressionism, of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning, of iconoclasm and conflict and wild improvisation. Visual art was about action and energy. It broke with convention. And the whole of culture — including poetry — was swept up by its tide. ""New York poets, except I suppose the colour blind, are affected most by the floods of paint in whose crashing surf we all scramble,"" wrote James Schuyler in 1959. He was one of a group of four — the others being John Ashbery, Frank O'Hara and Kenneth Koch — all of whom were, in one way or another, directly involved with the visual arts, working as critics and curators or collaborating with painters. These four poets were not actually a group in that they never set out their aims in any definitive way. How could they have? They were resolutely unacademic, unprogrammatic,
unprescriptive. But were certainly stimulated by each other. ""We envied each other, we emulated each other, we were very critical of each other, we admired each other, we were almost entirely dependent on each other for support,"" Koch later recalled. Like the Abstract Expressionists who inspired them, they shared a common stance, though not a common style. Now, for the first time, Carcanet gathers their work together into an anthology: The New York Poets, edited by Mark Ford. If the English reader wants to find out what happened to Modernism, to discover what became ofthe innovations of Pound or Eliot or, perhaps even more directly, where the ceaseless formal experiments and conversational expansiveness of Auden went, he need only flick through a few pages of this volume. They
crossed the Atlantic. Here is O'Hara, a modernday Baudelaire and probably the most New York, in the sense of the most-specifically urban of the four poets. The brisk simplicity of his earlier pieces — ""And here I am, the/ center of all beauty!/ writing these poems! Imagine!"" — gives way to eloquent experiments with prose poems, to his almost adolescent passions for film stars. Impromptu, impulsive, passionate, exclamatory,
his impact depends on his response to the physical matter of language. O'Hara thinks, as he puts it, with his bare hands. Ashbery is perhaps even harder to pin down. His poems, he said were just snapshots ""of whatever is going on in my head at the time"". Moving from the spare beauty of his prize-winning Some Trees to the disjunctive experimentalism of his extraordinary, long poem The Skaters, this anthology offers a sample of the quixotic range of a writer who can move from lightness to solemnity in a few lines, mix personal memories with poetic philosophies, echo multiple voices. Trains of ideas twist and proliferate. ""The poem is the chronicle of the creative act that produces it,"" he says. Just as Pollock liked to feel that he was ""in"" his painting, Ashbery seems to inhabit his work. To read it seems less to acquire an understanding of something complete than to assist in the process of its growth. Koch too is an innovator. A maverick among mavericks, as the editor of this anthology describes him, his exuberant powers of invention provoke. ""Summer in the trees! 'It's time to strangle several bad poets',"" he exclaims. His dynamic pieces expand an art form, fill its lungs with the Fresh Air ofthe work's title. They release daring forces and Koch controls them like a driver who just controls the fast car that goes skidding down mountain bends. Schuyler, who composed his first poem while recovering from the first ofthe many mental breakdowns he was to
HULTON ARCHIVE fflm&m Gferwyvt ^~>>t,i lmWm**St*~ ?//Mm m ?&& HlKPSft
suffer, is in fact the most literal, the most descriptive of the group, though he was quite literally psychotic. His poems are haunted by an almost pastoral mood. Experience and innocence play across their lucid surfaces. But these poets belong together. Their works echo each other; they have attitude. They evoke a fresh way of thinking, a new freedom from rules as they embrace all the energy, the distraction of their era. ""You can't plan on the heart,"" writes O'Hara, ""but the better part of it, my poetry, is open."" The New York poets create on a vast empty canvas. They let the forces of poetry buffet them about. This anthology can serve only as an
introduction. Just a fraction of the 500 odd poems from the collected edition of O'Hara's works can be reproduced, for example. But with a few omissions (where is Ashbery's benchmark poem The Tennis Court Oath?) the editor has sought to represent them in all their diversity and daring. The reader feels the electricity that fizzles through their lines, frazzling academic conventions, exploding grammatical rules, spitting the bright sparks that smouldered and ignited a new postmodern mindset.

9NYERVIEW5 FOLK PIN-UP JEWEL WANTS TO BE A POP DIVA. IT'S QUITE LOGICAL SHE TELLS NIGEL WILLIAMSON ..
JEWEL HAS a phrase to describe her transfor - mation from wholesome folk troubadour with the earnest lyrics to sexed-up pop diva with beats. ""Here 's cleavage and poetry,"" she says as she sits in a hotel room overlooking Hyde Park. ""People say if I'm being sexy, is that a sell-out ?"" she asks rhetorically. ""I enjoy the challenge of that. There are so many stigmas about women that are ingrained in society. It's easy for a guy to be intellectual and good-looking . I want to challenge the image that a woman can't also be intelligent and sexy at the same time."" Now 29, it's as if the woman who was once hailed as the successor to Joni Mitchell has de - cided to become the new Christina Aguilera. Or rather, she greedily wants both roles. Her new album 0304 (a reference to this year and next) finds Jewel forsaking her acoustic guitar and wistful, earnest songs. In their place are dance beats courtesy of Lester A. Mendez (the man be - hind the ""Latin Madonna"", Shakira) and catchy pop songs co-written with the likes of Guy Chambers, Robbie Williams's former songwrit - er , and Rick Nowels, whose credits include work for Ronan Keating and Kylie Minogue. The contrast is equally stark between the in - trospective , demurely chaste folkie who stared out of the cover of her first album, Pieces of You (1994), at the age of 19, her book of poetry, A Night Without Armour (1998), and the brash, multi-hued confident pop queen with the come - on look depicted on the front of 0304. ""I don't really see a difference,"" she insists. ""Women who want to be taken seriously dress down and in darker colours. I did that for a long time. If you're selling being sexual, you dress a different way and now I'm into really bright colours. But nobody is totally one thing or the other. I've gone nowhere. It's still me."" But why change her sound so dramatically, then? ""It 's such a dark time for the world, I felt I needed to make a very upbeat record. It's so obvious what's wrong with the world. It's blar - ing . I wanted to feel good. And I wanted to
make kids feel good, too."" She makes the analo - gy with big-band music in the Second World Wan ""That gave people a place to escape , and that's so important. It's music that goes some place and makes you feel there is a future."" Despite her folkie past, she insists that she always wanted to make a danceable pop record: ""This album may sound different to everybody else, but to me it's closer to what has been in my head for years. I haven't used electronic music before. That's like being a painter never using red or yellow, but in music it's as if you're not allowed to use beats and intelligent lyrics."" Some critics have suggested declining sales as a more cynical reason for the change. Pieces of You shifted 11 million copies in America in 1994. Bright-eyed , serious and oozing sincerity,
""I WANT TO CHALLENGE THE IMAGE THAT A WOMAN CAN 'T BE INTELLIGENT AND SEXY ""
it outsold Nirvana's Nevermind. She toured with her acoustic guitar supporting Bob Dylan and lagged behind only Madonna as the biggest female star in America. She had a great story to tell, too. Born and raised on a ranch in Alaska to hippie parents who lived on food stamps and welfare, she was singing in bars before her teens. By the time she was 17, she was living in a Volkswagen with lit - tle more than the clothes on her back and a gui - tar , writing songs and playing in coffee houses. Yet the phenomenal success of her debut al - bum proved hard to follow. Spirit (1998) and This Way (2001) became multi-platinum mil - lion - sellers but came nowhere near the sales figures of Pieces of You. Jewel laughs off the sug - gestion that the change of image is part of some marketing strategy: ""If people are saying that I did it to sell records, that's pretty silly because I sold a lot of records without using beats. It's not
a contrived strategy. My record label was wor - ried about me making a record like this. They didn't think it was an easy sell. They thought there was more to lose than to gain."" And what does she think? ""I always saw my - self doing this kind of record but I waited until I thought I could do it properly."" 0304 is her ""dance-hip-hop-folk"" album, she says. ""I wanted it to be a smart record that didn't shy away from topics."" And it is true that despite the glossy dance-pop beats, not all of her old seriousness has been obliterated. One song talks about Washington ""selling lies"". An - other , called America, talks about ""shedding blood in the name of liberty""."" People can just lis - ten to the melody and the beats if they want,"" she explains. ""They don't have to get the lyric. I'm not forcing anything down people's throats. But it's there if you want it.""
She claims that she thought about the poet Pablo Neruda ""a lot"" while making the record. And it is still the likes of Neil Young and Bob Dylan rather than Avril Lavigne and Christina Aguilera that she measures herself against. ""Those are the kinds of careers that I admire. Sustaining talent as they have done over so many years is hard work,"" she says. ""I 've never felt particularly tortured. But I always feel on the edge of failure. It's a bit morbid but I've always imagined myself on my deathbed look - ing back at my life. And 1 don't want to be embarrassed by myself."" Before I leave, I ask her to sign my copy of her book of poems. On the title page she draws a picture of herself naked and signs it with a flourish. Cleavage and poetry indeed. 0304 will be released on Atlantic Records on September 1

"Garner, Alan",Poetry that Lies beneath our Feet,The Times,2003-Jul-23,"London, England","GLOBAL WARMING and cooling are natural rhythms caused by small but complex changes in the Earth's orbit. At the moment, helped only in part by the Industrial Revolution, things are hotting up. Current predictions for the next hun - dred years are a rise of less than 3C, resulting in an increase in sea level of about 3 ft. In the delta of Bangladesh alone, the lives of some 36 mil - lion people will be at risk. Indirect results will be more severe weather patterns and the penetra - tion of salt into fresh water supplies. Drought in Sub-Saharan Africa will be commonplace. The need for water in the Middle East may eclipse land, politics and religion. Extremes of wealth and poverty will increase. World terrorism may become endemic. There are, simply, too many of us. Twelve and a half thousand years ago, the temperature rose by 7C, and the sea level by 400 feet, in 50 years. Yet it is unlikely that many human beings drowned as a direct result. People adapted and moved. The massive global warming led to agriculture, farming, the devel - opment of writing, the building of cities (that is, civilization), and ironically the freeing for occu - pation of a huge land mass that is now the main polluter and threat to our fragile and overload - ed human ecology: America. In 1957, aged 22,1 climbed up a steep field in Cheshire. A roofline appeared, and as more and more of the building was revealed. I believed less and less of what 1 saw. It was a timber framed mediaeval hall of the purest form: solar and parlour, great hall, cross passage and serv - ice bay. By 1957 it had slid down the social scale to be two agricultural tied cottages, one with a clos - ing order on it. Together with an acre of garden it was for sale at £510. I had 8 shillings and 3

pence to my name and no source of income. I am writing this now in the buttery. Over 46 years, scarcely a week has gone by without the house and the land revealing some - thing obvious but unnoticed. Simply by garden - ing and documentary research, we can appor - tion every fragment of pottery that the spade has revealed to the possibility of its being used by a named individual in an uninterrupted line back to 1335. Beyond that, the names are patchy and less secure, and end with Orme the Harper and Wulfric. Yet still the pottery goes on, through Saxon, Romano-British and the Iron Age. Then come the prehistoric periods, where a single moment can change a day. And that mo - ment never lessens its intensity. Flint. Flint is the most sensuous and evoca - tive of things. It is not a part of the geology of ~ Cheshire . When flint appears in the garden , someone must have brought it, used it. left it: here. That is the first visceral kick: to be the first hand and eye to know what the flint is since it was last held, however many thousands of years ago .
The second kick is more subjective but, be - cause of the longevity of my family's living in this area, not entirely to be dismissed. I may be turning in my hand something made by a hand the genes of which I share. The interconnections become more dense. Recently, geophysics has shown that the mediaeval hall occupies half of a Bronze Age round barrow. And next to it is an anomaly that respects the barrow and abuts onto it. From gar - dening , we may interpret that as masonry: prob - ably a collapsed structure. For perhaps two mil - lennia its existence was known and it was used ' as n quarry for building on the- site. The timber
hall, the latest incarnation of dwelling here, used its stone as sills to support and preserve the oak cruck framing. And one of these sill stones is decorated with carving that suggests that the stone building from which it was robbed was an Iron Age temenos or sacred shrine. The flints move backwards. Bronze Age ; Ne - olithic (the setting up of a farm); Mesolithic (hunter-gatherers ); and the evidence from the flints is that here was a winter camp, devoted to survival, repair, preparation.
Back and back. The Mesolithic flints are the link. I look now from the buttery over an Eng - lish idyll of pasture, meadow, oak, alder, brook and undulating green. Once it was different. At the edge of the garden, cobbles have been dumped to clear the field. Others made a yard and paths. They are multicoloured and beauti - ful . They have been brought from the Lake Dis - trict , from Ireland; they have been scooped from the bottom of the sea. The rolling fields are the slurry, the detritus of the ice : ice 1.200 feet thick. Some of the cobbles are quite different from the others. They have the shape of flatirons: smooth underneath, with one end pointed , the other blunt. Their tops are domed, and their up - per surfaces pocked as if by sandblasting. Yet not ""as if"". It was sand that blasted them. These cobbles are ""ventefacts"". For hun - dreds of years they sat on the ground here in

permafrost in a polar desert, where neither snow nor rain fell, but an endless wind blew. The ice had gone, and into this land people returned after an absence of 12,000 years . And so the end of the Ice Age and the start of the latest global warming began, marked in the garden by flint and pocked stone. This sketch of one experience of the steward - ship of a multifaceted yet coherent acre in Cheshire has been provoked by a remarkable book.
Steven Mithen, in After the Ice: A Global Hu - man Histoiy, 20,000-5 ,000 BC, has done for the world what is hinted at in the poetry of one gar - den . He has set out to communicate to the gen - eral reader the total effect of the end of the most recent Ice Age, and, without compromis - ing his scholarship, he has succeeded. He uses the literary conceit of a non - partici - pating time traveller, who observes key events in key places at key times, which are described in de - tail and then analysed and interpreted for us by Mithen. The scene setting and the descriptions are vivid; but these are no televisual trivialities. For ever)' graphic incident there is, in the end notes, the academic citation of Mithen's sources on which his scrupulous imagination has drawn and from which he develops his arguments. Un - derpinning all is a rigorous bibliography. The result is a model for such writing, partic - ularl y when the subject is so remote from us in time, yet so pertinent to our present and our fu - ture . The lucidity of Mithen's thought and prose will inform the professional and illuminate the general reader. After the Ice is that rare event: the right book at the right time.

BEFORE Steven Spielberg walked with dinosaurs, before George Lucas blew up the Death Star, and before James Cameron went in search of ghosts on the ocean floor, Ray Harryhausen was king of the creature feature. Over a 40-year career the Oscar - win - ning movie legend created the template for blending stop - mo - tion animation with live action that remains hugely influen - tial , even in this age of compu - terised monsters. Still spry and avuncular at 82, the California-born Harry - hausen sits in his West Lon - don office surrounded by sou - venirs of his illustrious career. A statuette of King Kong, from the movie that changed his life, encouraging him to take film-making classes at the University of Southern Califor - nia , stands shoulder to shoul - der with his Oscar. Mythical beasts from Jason and the Argo - nauts , The Golden Voyage of Sinbad and One Million. Years BC huddle beneath giant can - vases of ancient Greece.
mmmmtt! the veteran animator ray harryhausen STILL KNOWS A TRICK OR TWO. STEPHEN DALTON MET HIM
Harryhausen and his long - time producing partner Charles Schneer moved to Brit - ain in the early Sixties to take advantage of technical advanc - es here, as well as more exotic location options . ""You cant keep using the Grand Canyon and Malibu Beach for lost is - lands ,"" he says. ""We could get to Spain quickly, or Jordan or Italy, without sending a big crew over from Hollywood."" It is a testament to Harry - hausen 's stylistic signature that he is much better known than the directors of his films. Was he never tempted to go the next step and direct hu - mans as well as models? ""Very much so,"" he says. ""In fact, some critics used to say of my early films that it was a pity Mr Harryhausen didn't animate the actors, heh heh! But my actors always do exactly what I want them to, and I don't have to deal with agents. I felt I would water my - self down if I worked with real
Even casual movie fans will know his best-loved produc - tion , Jason and the Argonauts from 1963, with its celebrated skeleton fight sequence that took four months to animate for five minutes on screen. ""I think Jason is the most complete of our films,"" Harry - hausen says. ""I prefer Greek mythology over monsters on the loose. I destroyed Washing - ton and San Francisco, I knocked over the Washington
Monument long before Mars Attacks! It got kind of tire - some , especially when God - zilla got in on the act."" The veteran animator is un - im pressed by the copycat screen monsters he has in - spired over the decades. He is not a fan of the Japanese Godzilla series, a straight copy of Harryhausen's 1953 crea - tion The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms. More recently, the wobbly spaceships in Tim Bur - ton 's Mars Attacks! paid overt homage to Harryhausen's work on the 1956 film Earth vs the Flying Saucers. ""A hom - age ?"" he grins. ""You could put it that way. That was an inter - esting picture , but when they get too violent it's not really my cup of tea."" Harryhausen warms up when conversation turns to
the superstar directors who cite him as an influence. And what a list it is: Steven S piel - berg , James Cameron, George Lucas, John Landis and more. Landis keeps a signed letter on his wall that Harryhausen wrote back to him in his youth, and repaid the animation leg - end with cameo roles in two of his films, Spies Like Us and Bev - erly Hills Cop Ul And Tom Hanks, on presenting Harry - hausen with his valedictory Os - car in 1992, even rated Jason and the Argonauts above Citi - zen Kane and Casablanca as his personal greatest film of all time.

Harryhausen officially re - tired from film-making after Clash of the Titans in 1981, co - incidental !/ at the dawn of the era of computerised animation (CGI). ""The type of films that seemed to attract audiences were not my cup of tea,"" he says. ""You can't have an explo - sion every five minutes in Greek mythology."" But more recent develo p -
ments in animation have not bypassed Harryhausen. He is a fan and friend of Wallace and Gromit creator Nick Park, and expresses admiration for the computer-generated creatures in Walking with Dinosaurs. ""CGI has made some wonder - ful strides ,"" he says, ""but I would find it terribly restrict - ing to the creativity^ the char - acters . I've always thought that stop-motion gives a ni ght - mare quality to a fantasy film."" Harryhausen remains un - usually active for a man who retired two decades ago. Last year he was persuaded to com - plete The Tortoise and the Hare, an 11-minute short he be - gan 50 years ago. Later this month his name will be immor - talised with a star on Holly - woo d Boulevard.

And later this year he will spill all his ani - mation secrets in a detailed ""technical autobiography "".
But before all of this, Harry - hausen appears as a guest of honour at the Animated En - counters festival in Bristol to - morrow . ""I like to keep up with what interests people to - day in motion pictures,"" he ex - plains . ""I find it fascinating to talk to young people and see their tastes.

NO ONE SHOULD have any doubt that Amiri Baraka is capable of creating sublime moments of poetry. A unique historical figure, he stands at the confluence of three great vital currents of American life — Beat poetry, jazz and Black Power. The first reading I ever saw him give, in which he was accompanied by Archie Shepp on trumpet and Philly Joe Jones on drums, still ranks as probably the best performance of any - thing I have ever attended. Nearly 20 years af - ter hearing them, I can still chant — the way he does — his poignant lines from Wise 1 about the black experience of being robbed of tribal cul - ture and sold into slavery. If you ever find yourself some where lost and surrounded by enemies who wont let you speak in your own language who destroy your statues & instruments, who ban your omm bomm ba boom then you are in trouble deep trouble they ban your oom boom ba boom you in deep deep trouble humph ! probably take you several hundred years to get out! Several hundred years after his ancestors lost their ""oom boom ba boom"", and 68 years af - ter his own birth, Amiri Baraka (""Blessed Prince"" ), who was once called LeRoi Jones, is again in deep trouble. A Jewish group has de - nounced a polemical poem he wrote in re - sponse to September 11 as anti-Semitic , and com - pared him to collaborationist poet Ezra Pound. The governor and law-makers in Baraka's na - tive New Jersey want to pass a bill to strip him of his title as the state's official poet laureate, a two-year post that carries an annual stipend of $10,000. The row threatens plans by the State University of New York to establish a chair in Afro-American studies for him. ""This is the kind of double-think that goes on in bourgeois America,"" the still energetic Bar - aka complained in an interview at his home, just blocks from where he was born, in the sprawling ghetto that is Newark, New Jersey. ""Poetry is supposed to be completely non - politi - cal , and obviously the poetry that gets most of the awards is — though that's the politics of non-politics . This is not the first poem I've been jumped on for its political content A1967 poem called Black People was used as some sort of evi - dence to sentence me to three years in prison for participating in the Newark rebellion. ""They are saying that to be a great poet in America, one must have the politics of non - poli - tics . Otherwise, one is some poor poetry - terror - . ist,"" he said. ""But all poetry is political. If you are trying to do that with all your might in a way that is difficult to dismiss it, then one is liable to run into trouble."" Baraka, who has won a string of prestigious literary awards and was inducted last year into the American Academy of Arts and Letters, be - gan crafting his response to the terror attacks within days of September II. By the end of Octo - ber , he had finished a six-page poem - cum - con - spiracy theory. The trouble began only a year lat - er when — after being named New Jersey poet laureate — he read Somebody Blew Up America at a local poetry festival. In his fiery black nationalist days, Baraka once wrote that ""We want poems that kill"". When he reads, he breathes heavily, stomps his foot and becomes intoxicated with the rhythm — as much a musician as a poet Somebody Blew
Up America is long a series of questions begin - ning ""Who ?"" One stanza asks: Who knew the World Trade Center was gon - na get bombed Who told 4000 Israeli workers at the Twin Towers To stay home that day Why did Sharon stay away? The Anti-Defamation League and the local Jewish newspaper denounced the poem for propagating the ""Big Lie"" that Jews had been warned to stay away from the World Trade Cen - tre on the day of the attack. This preposterous conspiracy theory had quickly taken hold in much of the Muslim world. My own mother - in - law in Istanbul inquired about it after seeing it reported on Turkish TV. The theory seems to be based on the fact that the Israeli government said soon after the attack that it had received 4,000 calls from worried relatives, but was not immediately able to confirm any. Israeli deaths in the twin towers. ""The claim that Jewish peo - ple have special knowledge of things they do not have special knowledge of is anti-Semitism ,"" said the ADL's Shai Goldstein. Baraka was once married to a Jewish wom - an , the poet Hettie Cohen. But he divorced her after renouncing white bohemianism and em - bracing black nationalism in the wake of the 1965 murder of Malcolm X. During a decade as a proponent of black cultural nationalism and self-confessed ""whitey-hater "", he often criti - cised Jews in the rough language of the black ghetto. In the notorious Black People, for exam - ple , he enumerated the merchandise available in ""Sears , Bambergers, Klein's, Hahnes', Chase and the smaller joosh enterprises"" and advised blacks they could get it by saying the magic words: ""Up against the wall mother f**** r this is a stick up!"" Another of his lines declared: ""I got the extermination blues, jew-boys "". Disappointed in the performance of black politicians he had helped win power, Baraka lat - er renounced black nationalism in favour of
Marxism, writing an essay titled ""Confessions of a former Anti-Semite"" — a headline he now in - sists he did not pick. But even after his conver - sion to class struggle, he continued to attract controversy with his attacks on Zionism. Baraka lives in a rambling wooden house in Newark that is stylishly adorned with African tribal objects and Modernist art. The family watched the World Trade Centre burning from a bathroom window on the second floor. When I sat down with the poet, he cut straight to the point: ""In terms of there being some kind of an - ti - Semitic plot on my behalf to besmirch Jews, that is bizarre,"" he insisted. It is true, as Baraka pointed out, that Some - body Blew Up America contains passages that ap - pear to defend Jews. One section (misspelling Luxemburg and Liebknecht) reads, for instance: Who put the Jews in ovens, and who JieJped them do it Who said ""America First"" and ok'd the yellow stars Who killed Rosa Luxembourg, Liebneckt Who murdered the Rosenbergs But when Baraka tried to defend the passage about the. 4,000 Israeli workers who were told to ""stay home"", his reasoning became decidely bizarre.

died. But tell me why the conspicuous absence of Israeli workers,"" he explained. ""And the point I'm making then is not that I'm saying that Isra - el planned it, but that Israel knew, just like Bush knew, and that will obviously come out."" In fact, Baraka believes both England and France also knew of the attack in advance. ""They all sent warnings to the United States. And then they came out with that cockamamie excuse that they couldn't connect the dots,"" he said. The problem with Baraka's elaborate con - spiracy theory is that it lacks the most basic fact-checking . It hinges on the claim that no Is - raelis were among the 3,000 people killed — and that claim is just plain wrong. Unlike Bara - ka , I took the rudimentary precaution of calling the Israeli consulate in New York to ask about Israeli casualties. I quickly learnt that seven Is - raelis died that day, two of them on a hijacked plane and the rest in the twin towers. For the historical record, their names are: Daniel Lewin; Leon Leibo; Razu Vaev Alexey; Gui Bar Tzvi (all dual US-Israeli nationals); Hagai-Shefi ; Shai Levenhar; Alon Avraham. Richard Codey, Democratic state senator who introduced the legislation to strip Baraka of his official post, perhaps summed up Baraka's position best when he said tartly: ""I think Mr Baraka would be better off writing movies for Oliver Stone than being the poet laureate of New Jersey."" Baraka embraces political ideologies as poet - ic tropes , often very successfully. He could sim - ply defend his use of the myth about Israeli workers as a provocative poetic device. But he refuses to do so and instead insists on the literal truth of what he says. ""I make no apologies for the work being po - litical , because 1 intend it to be political,"" he said. Then he added, with a final rhyming flour - ish that reveals much about his thought - pat - terns : ""And it's not a bad thing to be attacked by your enemies. It shows, obviously, that you don't need an enema yet""

On poetry's pilgrims
rhythms, like a hammer tapping at the end of a bright nail, drive her points pre - cisely home. They pierce the subliminal layers of the mind They point at a deep - er truth. Henry Shukman makes an assured de - but with In Doctor No's Garden (Cape, £8; offer, £6.80). His poems are clear and un - laboured . Untempted to cram images, to try and impress with sputtering verbal py - rotechnics , he turns a slow, calm gaze on the world, captures what he sees with a skill that conceals his artistry. Beneath the understatement the emotion glints all the brighter. Shukman has a sharp eye for the de - scriptive detail, for the telephone wires that ""belly between their poles"" or the sky that ""warps and sings like a saw"". But he can move effortlessly from the con - crete to the abstract, from his wife in bed beside him breast feeding the baby to ""things more important than my own sleepy head"". In ""Piano Solo"", a haunting evocation of his mother sitting alone at
eoffrey Hill approaches the end of a journey. The Or - chards of Syon (Penguin, £9.99; offer, £8.49), the ^Swfei fourtn ^ ^""^ voi™ofa ""^JjfpQ hard-fought sequence, has been compared with Dante's Paradiso. A tough, uncompromising literary intelli - gence arrives, if not triumphant then at least undefeated, at some consolation to sustain the pilgrim mind. He reaches a ""hard-won knowledge of what wears us down"". . This meandering, meditative poem is dense, complex, perplexing. But Hill is a legislator of the English language. No oth - er uving poet has attended more strin - gently to the materials of his trade. No other has monitored meaning more scep - tically , watched more vigilantly over mor - al implications. Truth may be intransi - gent It may not deliver itself neatly into epigrammatic packages. But readers may trust in Hill completely as he leads them out into open-mindedness . ""Watch my hands/ confabulate their shadowed rhetoric,"" Hill writes. A critical eye oversees each line as it moves for - ward as a sketch might, sometimes confi - dent , sure of its sentiment, sometimes ten - tatively , worked and reworked as it spreads its slow map of the histories and philosophies , the memories and myths which give this world meaning. Hill's lines are the contours of an ances - tral landscape. They sculpt the culture in which his work is so deeply embedded .
This is what makes him England s most important Uving poet Andrew Motion, the poet officially nominated to speak for his country, pub - lishes his first collection since being ap - pointed Poet Laureate. Public Property (Faber, £12.99; offer, £10.39) includes works composed to commemorate the fu - neral of Diana, Princess of Wales, the 100th birthday and, later, the death of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. Bat Motion's imaginative resonance lies in a private world. It rises in a rural childhood, stemming from moments swallowed whole by memory, from the unexpected fragments of seeing that set the boy askance to his own experience and made of him a poet with an evoca - tive touch who could recall the ""gust of wet air"" that ""made the lawn enormous"", the weather that ""twirled round and round/ whacking the wheat heads flat"", the collie dog ""licking her lips and swal - lowing with a half-whine "", the fish ""asssembling itself from broken pieces of the world — gravel, wind, water, sun"". His most successful pieces are those that let stories unspool at their own pace, patterns of rhyme and rhythm playing over the surface until some sudden mo -
ment of understanding snaps up the imag - ination . Public feeling finds its sharpest focus when reinterpreted in some mo - ment of intimacy. In Feminine Gospels (Picador, £12.99; of - fer , £10.39) Carol Ann Duffy uses familiar literary structures to present a teasing, quick-witted take on the contemporary woman's experience. She looks for the modern in the mythical, picks the fact from the fantastical, finds the truth inside the fairytale. Marilyn Monroe, like some classical goddess who has inflamed the appetite of Jupiter, is raped by the cam - era , by the omnipotent celebrity which her beauty attracts. Ovid's Metamor - p hoses finds modern parallel in Duffy's poem. ""They filmed her harder, harder, till her hair/ was platinum,/ her teeth gems, her eyes/ sapphires pressed by a banker's thumb."" Duffy never fumbles. She captures her meanings with one sharp snatch. Her freshness is as startling as a bang on the funny-bone . She scours out cliches and makes them shine. But even as her imag - es skip playfully along, the reader is aware of their darker insinuations, of the more sinister aspects of a story which might otherwise have seemed fun. Her
night battering out Bartok, ""a weather/ of notes I wished would pass"", Shukman is at his most accomplished. He evokes all that is unspoken, unsaid, and yet most im - portant at the same time. A raw, unpolished, impudent debut is made by Paul Fryer in Don't Be So (Phaid - on / A Trolley Publication, £24.95; offer, £19.96). Illustrated by Damien Hirst, it is the first of a series of volumes intended to mark the collaboration between artists and poets. Often the poems are awkward, the words recalcitrant, refusing to line up obediently and do what he wants. But there is a freshness in his energetic, street-smart approach. Fryer treats lan - guage quite literally as a physical materi - al . It is something to be fought against and twisted, to be wrested round to his will. This is sometimes a strength — when words become blunt instruments, when they smash home a point with col - loquial force and then laugh at the trick. More usually it is a sign that Fryer has some way to go.

_["" "" ; o journey is to travel ' i into the imagination i ; as much as to discov - ; er new places and people . That is why _i . ', the poetry book makes the perfect companion. The slim volume that slips into the pocket lightly leads the traveller onwards into a deeper voyage of self-discovery . Dart (Faber £8.99; offer £7.64), a second collection by Alice Oswald, is published late this month. Make a note to buy it. This twiningly complex, gracefully lyrical volume traces the songlines of the river, tracks the course of the Dart from its source in Cranmere Pool on the ""rain-coloured wilderness"" of Dartmoor to the sea with its ""musky fishy genital smell/of things not yet actual"". For three years Oswald — whose first book, The Thing in the Gap-stone Stile, was ra ptur - ously received — has recorded her conversations with the peo - ple who live and work on this river — from the bailiff to the forester, from the tin extractor to the water abstractor , from the mythical water nymph to the historical figure who was swept to his death from a ford in the Victorian age: ""all day my voice is being washed away/out of a lapse in my throat"", he sings, ""o I wish I was slammick - in g home /in wet clothes, shrammed with cold and biwer - ing but/this is my voice/under the spickety leaves/under the knee-nappered trees/rustling in its cubby holes"".
Oswald has used these records, she explains in a fore - word , ""as life-models from which to sketch out a ser ies of characters — linking their voic - es into a sound map of the river"". Tones and dialects, prose cadences and verse rhythms flow together, plaiting rivulets of language and cadences of speech into a poem which spar - kles and shifts on the surface, but cuts a course that is embed - ded so deeply into the bones of the landscape that Oswald emerges as an inheritor of some of Br itain's greatest poetic voic - es , an heir to Ted Hughes, Sea - mus Heaney and Geoffrey Hill. Simon Armitage has also been on a journey. The Univer - sal Home Doctor (Faber £12.99; offer £10.39) sees him straying away from his native Yorkshire, exploring South American jun - gles and Australia's deserts. But, as always, Armitage's skill is to reach beyond the prosaic for deeper mysteries. A ticket
bought for a pound and pasted to a car windscreen in the park by the dunes is ""stamped with the time"" and so can tell us ""how taken you are, how car - ried away by now, how deep and how far""; the dead gannet ""beached between open water and blue sky/eating into the beach, feeding the sea"", speaks with an utter lack of sent imen - tality or pomposity of the transcendent mysteries that lie beyond the ordinary moment. Similarly, in Source (Cape, £8; offer, £6.80) Mark Doty distils the philosophies that are opened up by feeling. He finds
not answers, but the questions that lead the way towards new questions which lead the reader further on the journey towards some sort of truth. This is what he describes as ""the So? of poetry"". It is the ""littlest ques - tion "", but ""Shiva built the world, / the story goes, /on a single syl - lable /heavenly irritant,/and the pearl /of reality grew "". Travelling, said Descartes, ""is almost like talking with those of other centuries"". Paul Farley in The Ice Age (Picador £7.99; of - fer £6.79) retraces lost routes. ""This is how I get back_^in piec - es , the tang of a dream you can't
forget"", he writes. His poems scoop up melted memories, re - c all their once crystalline struc - tures , recapture their lost gleam. ""You can start with a washer, a throat-lozenge , a mouse-mat / and watch them move in like the weather"", like a returning ice age that holds the mind in its still and sparkling grip. Roger McGough might make an entertaining drinking part - ner when you take a break in your travels and stop in the pub for a pint In his latest collection Everyday Eclipses (Viking £9.99; offer £8.49), Liverpool 's best-loved poetic son takes to
the bar stool with tales of en - counters with an assortment of rock legends, whether Bob Dy - lan , Paul McCartney or Jimi Hendrix. There are two sides to all his stories — arid it's always the flip side that he exposes, the insights that eclipse the prosaic and make life suddenly strange. His poems work like philosophi - cal puns. And at night, when you are sipping whisky round your campfire , or lying in the slippery nylon of your B&B sheets, you could always slip a CD into a portable player and put on your headphones to listen to the sto - ryteller Hugh Lupton recounting the tales of The Horses (£9 incl. p&p, from Hugh Lupton : 8 Church Terrace, Ayl - sham , Norfolk NR11 6EU). At the funeral of Jenny Wing , who used to babysit him as a child, Lupton listened to the vicar struggling to find something to say of the 104-year-old woman who had been brought up on a farm in South Cambridgeshire and had outlived her genera -
tion . As the vicar stumbled, the stories she had once told him came swimming into his head. In this ""funeral oration that never happened "", folksong frames the two stories that weave a whole life around you, bringing the hard world of the late 19th-century farm back to life. You hear the voice of the farmer, ""husky early in the morning"", on the day that the horses were stolen: Violet, D ia - mon d , Beauty, Captain and Punch. You hear the horseman ""speaking more in song than in words"" as he calls them, ""the sweet high whistle"" that turned the working team on the plough, ""the secret trill that urged the geldings on behind the wagon"". You feel the warm rubbly breath, the hard curve of the nosebone, smell the must of the stables, the sweet harness soap and, as you journey back deeper into the world of imagi - nation , the tears that no one was there to shed at her funeral start slowly to well up inside you and spill.

WHEN THE poet Ruth Padel proposed a newspaper column consisting of a contemporary poem and her analysis of it, she thought it unlikely that readers would want anything as ""unsexy"". But the column was a success, prompting numerous readers to write in asking for more. Sadly, this fairytale relationship between public and poet cannot be extrapolated to the world at large. Even now that modern poetry is enjoying a so-called renaissance, few would claim that they can really ""understand"" a poem even if they do get pleasure from reading it. So Padel has produced a
special kind of compendium to take the fear out of modern verse. Fifty-two poems, from writers as diverse as Thorn Gunn and Rita Ann Higgins, are accompanied by companion pieces of textbook criticism. The critical essays dissect the poets' technique, revealing how and why they have written what they have. They read like A-level English essays mixed with the Idiot's Guide to Poetry. That said, Padel chooses her poems with impeccable taste, and this book will allow you to appreciate internal rhymes and Alexandrines where previously you saw only prose broken arbitrarily into lines. Her main achievement, though, is as an anthologist of the best of today's English poetry. The commentary is a bonus, but once you have got the hang of listening out for the phrasing of a line you probably won't need Padel to hold your hand.

comedians, almost musicians, or almost wild ventriloquists. Even the poets who basically think of their work as words on a page have become performing animals : — and that made for some excellent, entertaining radio. The weekend at the Lowry Centre in Manchester wasn't all perfect. Some of - the more scripted-sounding offerings — Motion's introduction on Saturday of five young poets shortlisted for an Arts Council prize, and the edition of Poetry Please featuring Sophie Hannah and Simon Armitage as well as the young prizewinner — had the timid, stilted feel of Classic FM.

You could hear them being drawn happily into her
world and losing any suspicion of verse as she performed poems and chatted vivaciously, with charm and at high speed, about anything from writing to Glaswegian slang. I enjoyed Rosie Boycott's laid-back late-night chat with Kay and Frank Delaney, the presenter of Poetry Please, about favourite books. And the Saturday night knees-up , presented by Lemn Sissay, with Manchester's liveliest performance poets as well as Roger McGough and one more burst of Kay, was a mind-stretching , euphoric , joyous entertainment, featuring Rommi Smith and her band with an effective fusion of spoken word and music. There was a lot more that I didn't manage to take in, but the message coming across loud and clear was that the old British suspicion of versifiers might at last be on the wane. There are differences in the kind of poetry that gets on to Radio 4 and Radio.3 —
broadly. Radio 3 may go for more difficult and experimental work, such as . Joby Talbott's haunting Between the Ears piece, The Watchers, on Sunday, which set CCTV and the surveillance. culture in a musical landscape evoking paranoia — but the sheer quantity of poetry on air is growing fast on both stations. Radio 3 is about to bring in unexpected snippets of poetry from its archives to fill in gaps if a concert underruns. Radio 4's Poetry Please has expanded from ten to 30 minutes; poetry has even been heard on the Today programme. Not that the subtle emotions of poetry are taking over completely. Those who prefer to consider words more analytically will have enjoyed the satirist Joe Queenan's pacy and entertaining consideration of irony, and the exaggerated reports of its death, on Radio 3's Sunday Feature. Guests, including Kathy Lette and Ian Hislop,
pondered such gems as Spike Milligan's epitaph, ""I said I was ill""; and a briefly serious Hislop defended irony by suggesting it was what ""helps you not to take too seriously the version of events foisted on you from outside"".

letters and cryptic clues — can always struggle along with Colin Dexter's very dry Crosstalk. I won't be joining them.

ATHOL FUGARD was often in trouble with the South Afri - can authorities, losing his pass - port in the 1960s, but his fear and outrage didn't put him to flight Instead, he worked with the likes of John Kani and Win - ston Ntshona on plays attack - ing the pass laws and the im - prisonment of black dissidents. But other writers left the country, arguing that they could fight apartheid more ef - fectively in places where they could freely publish what they felt. So what effect did exile have on them and their work? That's the question that the 69-year-old Fugard addresses in his his new Sorrows and Re - joicings , through the character of Dawid Olivier, an Afr ikaan - er poet who has returned from 17 years in London to die and be buried in his native Karoo. I'd like to say that the piece packs the emotional punch of some of his early protest plays; hut it doesn't . There's some -
thing stilted about the writing. At times it seems more a for - mal elegy than a living play. There 's good reason for Fu - gard 's elegiac tone, because he sets Sorrows and Rejoicings in Dawid's Karoo house just after his funeral, and the poet him - self appears only in intermit - tent flashback. But there's no reason why the piece 's pulse shouldn't race, given the three women on stage. One is his Anglo widow, Jennifer Steyn's
Allison. Another is Denise Newman's Marta, the maid he loved, made pregnant and left. And the third is the fruit of their union, the daughter he woefully neglected, Amrain Ismail-Essop 's Rebecca. Only Ismail-Essop , whose Rebecca spends most-of the evening standing silently and resentfully at the door of the living room in which she was conceived 18 years ago, adds much power to the produc - tion , which is Fugard's own (a mistake ?). The two older wom - en talk of their mutual resent - ment and pain, but you never feel their feelings are very strong , let alone visceral. That may be because their primary task is to describe and debate the dead man's tri bula - tions . The real drama is in the past , not the present: which
isnt , as it turns out, the most exciting place to be. In any case, the tale of Mar - ius Weyers's Dawid is a none - too - ori ginal one of disenchant - ment and disintegration. He re - nounces the ""eager, hungry lit - tle faces"" of black children in South Africa for a job in a posh London school. Though he tells himself that ""exile is go - ing to give me back my voice"" and poetry ""is the only weap - on I've got"", his poetry dries up and he becomes a soak. ""If my writing ever had a heart, it's stopped beating ,""-he tells his now-estranged wife. Only when terminal leukae - mia is diagnosed does he find the pluck to return home.

Im sure that the guilt and demoralisation of exiles was part of the collateral damage wreaked by apartheid; but even the charismatic, emotion - ally resourceful Weyers has trouble making Fugard's oddly literary, sometimes even clunky, dialogue demonstrate this sad truth. And that means that the con - clusion , which is that the new South Africa should embrace whatever was ""clean and clear and good"" in people like Daw - id , comes across more as an eminent dramatist's rhetoric than as an impassioned citi - zen 's plea.

—a——— i —.1 i THIS NEW collection of poems by Robin Robertson opens with: ""We are drawn to edges, to our own/parapets and sea-walls "". His poetry balances along the mind's boundaries, looking forwards and backwards, outwards and inwards and finding its voice in the echoes that flicker between the two. But always beyond resonance or resolution lies an emptiness to which Robertson is most acutely alert It is this absence that his poems make present, the nothingness that they try to make felt
Yet these poems are rooted in the literal, in noticing and observing and describing. They never lose their anchor in the physical world. Robertson is a master of evocative depiction. He captures ""that net of birds/ that moves/unloosened/ under bridges at dusk""; ""the sea/wrecking itself against
the rocks"", the flamingos that ""rise through green beds on their high pink stems,/ swaying gently in full bloom: mesmeric,/self-mesmerised "". Robertson walks through the world like a beachcomber along the shore, picking up each object that catches his eye, turning it over, examining it, holding it up to the light He admires the reflections that glance from prismatic surfaces, he pauses to prod a dead animal with the toe of his boot
Particularly striking is the intensity of the attention that the poet offers each subject There is nothing unpremeditated, no sudden caprice The world is seen filtered through the slow delay of language. And Robertson calibrates this language as carefully as a locksmith his key, so that ""the slow-grained slide to embed the blade/of the key is a sheathing,/a gliding on graphite"" but when ""the true key slots"", when there is ""a clinch of words"", ""the sung note snibs on meaning"". It is this exactitude that gives Slow At its distinctive edge.

Vaughan: ""I saw Eternity the other night,/ Like a great ring of pure and endless light"". This anthology, its entries dat - ing back to Chaucer, includes plenty of old favourites. But the 20th-century slant is very strong. Giving all his more notable con - temporaries a look-in , Motion provides a serviceable representa - tion of today's poetic establish - ment — and sticks up for women and foreigners at the same time. Though personal preferences do sneak in—Bob Dylan is rep re - sented , and Edward Thomas (on whom Motion wrote a critical study) is allocated as many entries as Shakespeare — read - ers should not expect to draw the - n 1 Vfi i I- 1 J t '
same sort of lucky-dip prizes as they did from his predecessor's eccentric (and now classic) Battle - bag . The wheels run a little too smoothly. You may hear the mu - sic of the spheres , but Faber — which devotes so much of its poet - ic energy to repackaging — was probably more concerned about producing a moneyspinner. Any new volume by Geoffrey Hill is welcomed by admirers of his tenacious intelligence, his dark prophetic vision, his resolve to wrest truths from language. But his latest collection, Speech! Speech! (Penguin, £9.99; Books Direct, £8.49), finds him at break - ing point. An all-consuming urge to communicate struggles with the words which refuse to deliver
their meanings straight. ""Erudition . Pain. Light"" a poem begins . It's an indication of what's to come. Here are 120 stanzas (one for each of the days of Sodom) to get your teeth into instead of the jumbo crossword. Hill engages in every kind of word game, wrestles with every Protean trick of speech. The poetry is so impenetrable, so widely allusive, so fragmented, it becomes frustrating/ But when you think you will have to give up, a needle 's eye of insight suddenly opens and your mind is drawn through it, an un - spoling thread. Spend a day con - sidering the surreal as a ""loss of peripheral vision"" for instance, and nnrice how fantastical the
whole world suddenly seems. Derrek Hines simplifies rather than complicates. He takes the ancient fable of Gilgamesh, first told when the Bible was still a twinkle in God the Father's eye , and does to it what West Side Story did for Romeo and Juliet. His Gilgamesh (Chatto, £8.99; Books Direct, £7.64) is less a ""pass notes"" style introduction to an epic (which can be read in a
literal — and hence much length - ier — version in Andrew George's excellent Penguin Clas - sic s translation) than a variation on a theme. Better not to bear the original too much in mind. Hines's energetic metaphors, nimble wit and laddish tone re - vivify the thrill of a very old tale. Christopher Logue's version of the Iliad, its first three volumes now collected under the title War Music (Faber, £12.99; Books Di - rect , £10.39), is similar. He brings a cinematic perspective and a modern sensibility to Hom - er 's epic narrative. ""Just tumbled on Christopher Logue's extraordi - nary rendition,"" wrote Henry Miller some 40 years ago when he chanced on the opening sec - tions of a work whose piecemeal publication over the intervening years has come to be heralded as a literary event. ""If only Homer were anywhere near as good."" Logue goes straight for the dra - ma . Forceful language, powerful images and the strong, rolling rhythms of the iambic pentame - ter draw the reader onwards.
The frequent transitions between direct speech and commentary, and the sharp, almost filmic, scene cuts keep the imagination fresh. Logue's skill is to condense and clarify. He distils the essence of an ancient text. John Updike is probably best known for his Pulitzer Prize - win - ning ""Rabbit"" novels. And read - ers will find echoes of their light - hearted sophistication in his Americana and Other Poems
(Penguin, £10.99; BooksDirect, £8.79). Updike is almost 70, but his eye remains as sharp as his pen. A TV remote ""waits by the bed like a suicide pistol"", a coas t - line is as flat ""as a brain-dead's beep"". But it's his subject matter which will strike readers forci - bly . The first section of this volume is about planes, the no - man 's land of the domestic flight . In one poem he explores our fears of the ""sweaty , swarthy/
gentleman of Middle Eastern origin/ whose carry-on luggage consists of a bulky black briefcase/... Who wants to have all their careful packing — the trav/eller's checks, the folded un - derwear — / end as floating sea - wrack five miles below,/ drifting in a rainbow scum of jet fuel?"" He adds: ""The possibility of impossibility will keep drawing us back / to this scrape against the numbed sky.""

However, m |pf f§§ j Shane MacGow - l £if m3 ZS&l an, once of the Pogues and now with the Popes, seems to have pulled it off in life. I meet him and his longtime amour, journalist and biogra - pher , Victoria Clarke, in their fa - vourite Dublin restaurant, the Trocadero, just around the cor - ner from Blooms, the hotel that MacGowan seems to have adopt - ed as his spiritual home. Having met MacGowan a cou - ple of times before, I know what to expect: the crumpled, mysteri -
ously stained suit, the ghostly pal - lor , the dreadful dental abattoir of a mouth, the cheerful abuse (""You 're a complete moron, what kind of stupid question is that?""), the occasional mouth-breathing naps at the table and, strangely enough, the elegance, wasted though' it might be. The quick wit, the intelligence , the melan - cholic sweetness, the raffish charm and outlaw defiance. ""I seriously don't care if I never make another record again,"" he says . ""I could get all the gigs I want, anytime I like. I'd say. 'Just give me a free drink and a bed to sleep in, and I'll sing.' I'd never be short of work, and I'd proba - . bly be a lot happier.""
Certainly, whatever else MacGowan might be (and he can be terribly rude: ""I don't give a s**t that your daughter is called Erin"" ), there is no denying that he has the X factor which makes admirers from all over the world forgive his misdemeanours, re - joice in his achievements, and al - ways keep an eye and an ear open for what he might be get - ting up to. Maybe this is why, even sitting quietly at the restaurant table, MacGowan has a steady stream of wellwishers — friends and strangers — coming up to shake his hand, clutch his arm in a fond , brotherly fashion, or pat him on the back. The number of times this happens, anyone would think that MacGowan was some kind of unusual sight in Dublin, a religious vision in himself, and that this was his

fans' only chance to talk to him. ""How you doing, Shane?' they say fondly, or, just as frequently, ""Well done, Shane!"" What are they congratulating MacGowan for, you wonder. Cynics might say that it's his legendary drink - ing habits, much documented in his increasingly fractious deal - ings with the media. All of which came to a sticky head when Sinead O'Connor shopped him to the authorities a little while back. O'Connor insisted that she'd done it for his own good, and that she'd found MacGowan lying in a heroin-induced stupor on the floor. MacGowan claims he was sitting on the sofa, watc h - ing a. Sam Peckinpah video, when O'Connor burst in. ""I don't know what she was try - ing to do,"" he groans, ""and I dont give a damn what she thought . She's dead as far as I'm concerned.""

But she was obviously trying to help , I say, she clearly loved you, well, tough-loved you any - way . ""That 's her problem,"" he
growls, annoyed. ""I don't want to know about her or talk about her any more."" Another growl. ""No comment"" It's fair to say that public affec - tion for MacGowan and his work seems to run a lot deeper than mere vicarious pride inhis alcoholic machismo or druggy past. ""I don't do Class A drugs any more,"" he sighs. ""I want to make that clear. I get very p****d off when people try to make out that I'm out of it all the time. I just like a drink. Who doesn't ?"" He laughs. ""Who doesn't that's at all interesting, anyway?"" Clarke agrees. ""That 's one of the reasons why I wrote the book \A Drink with Shane MacGow - an ] really. Shane is always being portrayed as some kind of drunk - en moron, when really he is this very intelligent man who knows lots about Irish history, politics, literature and poetry. And, I think, one of the greatest ever storytellers. A genius, really."" Clarke herself is best known for her astonishing spat with Courtney Love over a never - to - be - published Nirvana biogra - phy , which led, she alleges, to her being threatened by grunge's First Lady and the late Kurt Cobain in a series of answer -
phone messages. They were aw - ful ,"" confirms MacGowan. ""They sent a chill down my spine."" Clarke decided to present A Drink with Shane MadGowan in a question-and-answer format when writing it more formally had the effect of stifling MacGow - an 's singular narrative style . She took her material from a series of rants (sometimes in hotels, some - times in airports, never entirely sober). What emerges is a hugely funny; interesting and moving memoir, which tells the story of MacGowan's happy, albeit frac - tured , childhood in Ireland, then England, his musical genesis
and career, and even manages to incorporate his encyclopaedic knowledge of Irish culture and history. ""I am not well-read ,"" he insists, adding mischievously, ""It 's only next to moronic English rock stars that I look well read."" As A Drink with Shane MacGowan proves, Shane is very well-read , underlining his status as a definitive Irish song - writer . Indeed, with global hits such as Fairytale of New York, Pair of Brown Eyes and Rainy Night in Soho, it's apparent that, as much as Van Morrison, he

clearly qualified for the job of writing his memoir. MacGowan, for his part, loves it (""I 'm very proud of what Victoria's done"" ) even though he has his beefs, about alleged misprints and inac - curacies and, it seems, the very idea of a memoir. ""I admit I wanted the autobiog - raphy written,"" he says. ""It was supreme arrogance , a terrible mistake on my part. I was so drunk I didn't even know what I was saying ."" ""That's absolute b*****^"" says Clarke. ""You were as sober as you are now. You had lots of op -
portunities to take out bits you didnt like, and you never did."" ""I 'm a busy man,"" yells MacGowan, affronted. ""You were watching televi - sion !"" counters Clarke, adding, ""if you're afraid of looking arro - gant , then forget it, because you are arrogant."" Any more of this and they will become my favour - ite couple. Indeed, it's like this a lot with MacGowan and Clarke — one moment smiling, gooey-eyed at each other, the next sparring vi - ciously , if good-humouredly . Will they get married? ""Oh yes."" What about children? ""None of your business,"" MacGowan snorts. Later he says to Clarke: ""It wouldn't work. I wouldn't change nappies and nor would you . You'd be the worst. You'd go to Thailand and never come back. I'd be stuck with them."" And MacGowan glares point - edly at me, then emits one of his death-rattle laughs. As ever, it's very hard not to laugh with him.

Transfixed by the bloody battlefield
The novelist Pat Barker shares a connection to the Great War with her favourite poet, Ted Hughes
NEW SELECTED POEMS 1957-1994
Ted Hughes Faber & Faber £9.99
lp| AT Barker was shocked by 1—^ her first reading of Ted JL Hughes's poetry. It was the shock of recognition. ""It was the English countryside depicted as it actually is,"" says the Booker Prize-winning novelist. ""I would have been in my mid-teens when Hughes's first collection. The Hawk in the Rain (1957), was pub - lished . I had recently moved to Tee - side from rural West Yorkshire where I spent most of my childhood. ""I didn't want to move to the town and what struck me particu - larly when I picked up Hughes in die town library was that I could hear the Yorkshire dialect in his poeiry and also see the West York - shire landscape thai I loved."" Hughes's bloody-taloned hawk is the nightmare antithesis of Keats's warbling nightingale, and this was something which Barker fiercely identified with. . ""The realism of the descriptions of the animals in Hughes's poetry -- the hawk, the pike, the bull — was something 1 could relate to. One of the many English hypocri - sies is thai people don't want to think of what happens between the cow in the field and the beefburger on their plate, it's certainly not an aspect of the countryside that you find represented in English litera - ture , bui you do find it in Hughes. He has been criticised for being ex - cessively brutal, excessively violent, but nature is excessive. ""I grew up on a farm; my grand - father was a slaughterman. I relat - ed to that violence."" Barker was brought up from birth by her grandparents. Her grandfather, a veteran of the First World War, was the dominant fig - ure in her early life and the inspira - tion for her highly acclaimed trilo - gy of novels about the Great War, Regeneration (which has been made into a feature Sim), The Eye in The Door and The Ghost Road (winner of the 199$ Booker Prize).
As a child, she watched her grandfather washing at the sink and was fascinated by the scarring on his body from a bayonet wound. 'The unspoken thing in our house was my grandfather's bayo - net wound and my grandfather not talking about how he got his bayo - net wound,"" Barker says. ""In later life, when he was dying of cancer, his interpretation of the symptoms of his cancer was that the bayonet wound had opened up ."" It is easy to imagine the impact Hughes's poem Bayonet Charge had on a teenager who had grown up with this livid symbolism. Barker quotes the lines: ""In what cold clockwork of the stars and the nations/Was he the hand pointing, that second?"" She says it with quiet intensity, more mantra than recita - tion . ""It 's probably one of the weak - er poems in the collection but even if it doesn't quite come off, it's a hugely powerful image."" Still more impressive, for Barker, is the poem Six Young Men. in which Hughes contemplates a photo of long-dead soldiers. 'The poem gives very powerfully the impression that the Great War is something that is still around. Hughes calls it 'the national ghost'. His father fought in the First World War and it must have been the ghost in the house where he was growing up. It was certainly the ghost in ours."" The incalculable losses of that war will never be reconciled, says Barker, who presents the Armistice Day programmes on BBC Knowl - edge . ""We were filming at the war' graves,"" she recalls, ""and I walked around a graveyard behind a young man, who was about 19 years old. He turned to me and said: 'But they were my age', and he was very shocked."" ^ . .„..,. >,.,. „.;, Yet in Hughes's "" poetry.-it :VKas,the, living argument, not the commemo - ration of the dead, which so deeply impressed her. ""Hughes talks
about this ghost which is still 'every - where , molesting everybody' and the reason he gives for it is that be - cause of the hostility that grew up between the fighting men at the front and the people at home who were totally uncomprehending of what was going on in France, you have got some of the resonance of a civil war. It is an argument I hadn't heard advanced by anyone else. That is why it is so difficult for us to put this particular war to sleep."" As veterans grow fewer with each Armistice Day, Barker recognises that the ""direct inheritance"" — that personal connection with the First World War — is disappearing. Jingoism is not appropriate in a modern Europe. And the point, she insists, is not that we should not for - get , but that we cannot forget. ""I think Hughes was right: mat chasm, that huge crater left in socie - ty by the First World War, was psychologically like a civil war. And no nation can afford to forget its civil war."" .

THE BEDROOM OF THE MISTER'S WIFE
Philip Hensher Vintage £6.99
P HILIP Hensher's short story collection, The Bedroom of the Mister's Wife, is an oddly random affair. There is seemingly no link between these stories of qui - et dismay: rather a series of distinct images, like lives glimpsed for an instant in lighted windows. The characters Hensher chooses to impersonate — a barefoot boy at a missionary school, a clubber pumped up on Ecstasy, a frustrated secretary, a gay civil servant, an in - ternational terrorist — might be plucked from a hat for all the rela - tion they bear each other, yet all im - plant themselves in the reader's con - sciousness with peculiar tenacity. Hensher turns a flat but forgiv - ing light on a world where people are, on the whole, disappointed. One of the stories is set in Czecho - slovakia in the aftermath of the Prague Spring. Another concerns a 'Hensher turns a forgiving light on a world where people are disappointed'
Russian emigre locked in a person - al vendetta against Stalin's daugh - ter . Even when he's writing about the anonymity of London life or the stifled screams of suburbia, there is a faintly Middle European cast to Hensher's stories. Chekhov would approve of these profoundly ordinary lives, illumi - nated , if rarely ennobled, by pas - sion . In one tale, an aimless man, the much-stigmatised archetypal loner, finds new purpose in his deci - sion to kill his noisy neighbours. In another, an office worker con - demne d to the living hell of writing ads for porcelain figurines, sets out to dismantle a colleague's marriage with a callousness that is almost exhilarating. The rich black seam of humour running through the stories keeps the reader digging away through layers of careful urbanity and ennui. At times Hensher's humour takes an absurdist turn, as in the cautionary tale in which a young professional dies in an attempt to reach the top of the London pro - perty ladder. There is a broad, almost cinema t - ic , humour in the description of German prison guards trying to
impersonate the shrieking, unhing - ed terrorist Ulrike Meinhof, for a rigged identity parade. The short story is a kind of distil - lation process; lives are shrunk to the space of an afternoon, grand ob - sessions reduced to a gesture. In The Bedroom of the Mister's Wife, the writing is filtered and refined until the prose runs clear as gin. Hensher hits the ground run - ning with each new narrative, but somehow the reader believes in the existence of these characters out - side the confines of their particular story : a good trick to pull off in a full-blown novel. In a short story, it is spectacular . EJD

AT THE DRESSING-TABLE MIRROR
recalls Szirtes . ""For those first few years in the Seventies, I think I would have been lost without him."" Szirtes 's first published poem appeared in the TLS in 1973. For the next five years , his work appeared intermittently in liter - ar y magazines, before he finally published his first book, The Slant Door , in 1979. Yet the real turning point in his poetry came in 1975, when his mother committed suicide. She had had a weak heart since con - tracting rheumatic fever as a girl. ""It was a miracle she survived Ravensbruck ,"" says Szirtes. ""She suffered badly and was in con - s t ant pain . That was certainly a factor when she ended her life. But also, there was a sense — ex - ile is maybe too grand a word — that being away from everything that meant most to her got to her in the end."" Her death changed the way Szirtes wrote. ""Up until then my chief influences would have been Blake and Rimbaud. I was a
Romantic. After she died I want - ed to write one poem that would hold everything together. The poem that did that was called At the Dressing-table Mirror. It was the first poem that The Listener published. I had become a more formal poet."" At the Dressing-table Mirror seems a simple poem. It contains two people, an interior and a brief exchange of glances, based on a memory from his childhood in Budapest. Yet to capture that moment took six months, and more graft than any of his previous efforts. Although the poem is included in The Budapest File, it was writ - ten at a time when the city meant little to him. His visits to Hunga - ry during the Eighties, and his de - veloping skills as a poet, howev - er , led to longer, more explorato - ry poems that pieced together his family's past.

Sense of tradition is the perfect excuse for succumbing to poetry as we ring in a new millennium, says Rachel Campbell-Johnston
Can you imagine intro - ducing yourself as an ""unacknowledged legislator of the world"" ? Things have clearly changed since the days of young Shelley. I mean, poetry? .. .isn't that a bit like talking to yourself? Like dropping a rose petal into the Grand Canyon and waiting for the echo? Well, no, not at the moment. The sound has been turned up on the slim volume of late. This probably had quite a lot to do with debate over the new laureate. But, as far as public poetry is concerned, being on the brink of a new epoch has certainly helped. Britain has succumbed to
the millennial cult of commem - oration . In search of fit ceremo - nies to mark the great moment we turn to tradition — much as a mother , with the birth of a new baby, might rummage for the family christening robe. Poetry may have had to struggle for attention this cen - tury . It may have gone to ground with the Georgians and got mired up with the Movement. But with the arriv - al of a new millennium it has been pulled out of the old chest, freshly laundered and newly pressed. Hardly surprising then that a poet should have been ap - pointed to the Dome. So much money has been invested in
this Teflon folly that it had to be dignified in some way, had to be made to seem important to a public who paid for it with their lottery flutters. So earlier this year Simon Armitage, one of Britain's foremost young po - ets , was approached by the New Millennium Experience Company to write ""some - thing "" to mark the occasion, ""something"" to be declaimed in the Dome. ""I suggested I would write 1,000 lines,"" says Armitage. ""Rather stupid since I don't usually get past the bottom of the page. But then writing is what I do and this commission was like taking my job on the chin.""
His finished work, Killing Time, to be published on New Year's Eve, takes inspiration from the news events of the past 12 months — from ""an y - thing that tweaked my con - science "". Armitage ""uncurls the stubborn fist of what is gone"" with a bold, energetic, sceptical account of the age which alights on anything from Bjork to breaches in the ozone layer, from the Soho bombing to Bill Gates, from mobile phones to the Balkans. ""I saw this poem as a sort of time capsule,"" he explains, ""grabbing things out of time, however intense or banal."" But does Killing Time serve its purpose as a public poem? Armitage, who was writing it during the months when the laureateship was under discus - sion , was constantly aware of debate as to the purpose and nature of public poetry in a contemporary age.
The rhythms of declam - atory verse sound lu - dicrously gallumph - ing to the modern ear. The grandiloquent Victorian verse structure vanished with its greatest architects, Kipling and Tennyson. ""In the Victori - an age,"" says Armitage, ""there was a prevalent idea that things should last forever. But I don't think that global, wordy language works any more. I was brought up in a pop culture of'enjoy things for what they are at the time' and I'm not sure that poetry hasn't changed to reflect that."" Poet and novelist Helen Dunmore suggests that the only distinction between the public and the private poem now is that the former deals with national or political is - sues . ""I 'm not sure that you can have public poetry with - out politics,"" she says, citing the intense political commit - ment of Louis MacNeice's Au - tumn Journal. (It was, inciden - tally , on the leapfrogging rhythms of this poem that Ar - mitage modelled his Killing Time.) Still the problem remains: which voice should a public poet adopt in order to stay true to his thoughts and emotions and, at the same time, convey them to a wider audience? ""It is ridiculous in this day and age to imagine that we have a national voice,"" says ^
the Poet Laureate, Andrew Mo - tion . 'There is no one voice which speaks for everyone. What a public poet probably needs is a private voice which resonates in public spaces."" Armitage agrees. 'The amaz - ing thing about art,"" he says, ""is that you think a feeling is individual and then you find that hundreds of people feel the same. The ideas that are peddled on a day-to-day basis are the ones that people recog - nise the most."" ""I don't think that there is any necessary distinction be - tween the commissioned pub - lic poem and the private one,"" says James Fenton, formerly Professor of Poetry at Oxford. He uses the work of Seamus Heaney as an example. ""Heaney wrote many poems to do with the deaths of friends, with events in Ulster . They have become the public poetry of Ireland although in
no sense were they commis - sioned . Ted Hughes, on the other hand, as Laureate, made the somewhat eccentric choice of putting his deeply personal mythology at the service of the Royal occasion. When they were published everyone main - tained a respectful silence."" Of course, a principal prob - lem for anyone commissioned to write a public piece is the deadline. Where anyone else might scrumple up failed at - tempts into the bin and await further inspiration , the com - missioned poet must produce. There is bound to be a high failure rate. Killing Time highlights this — although probably without intending to — for Armitage serves as a sort of retrospective laureate for those vacant months between the death of Hughes and the appointment of Motion . It is hard not to feel that he has dodged many of
the charges of melodrama, op - portunism , inaptness and in - eptness to which any public poem is inevitably open, by vir - tue of the fact that he has had time for reflection. ""Perhaps fu - ture laureates should not feel impelled to react instantane - ously to events,"" suggests Helen Dunmore. Certainly a central theme of Armitage's poem is a sense of the manipulation of an infor - mation age, a sense of a media that imprints ready-processed sentiments upon people. He is sceptical of news ""that starts as business, ends as enter tain - ment "", of the cold-blooded pur - suit of ""the story"". In the end, for the public as much as the private writer, there is only one touchstone: the self. ""Every poet has to be true to his own artistic na - ture ,"" says Fenton. This at - tempted fidelity is what comes across most strongly in Kill -
ing Time. The poem draws to its close in a quietly personal space : ""And finally, last week in a West Yorkshire village/ nothing happened at all./ An incident room is being set up at the scene,/ and security cam - eras installed."" We may call it the millenni - um . We may call it history. We may make a record of our times — but all that makes it up in the final assessment is lots of small moments in the lives of thousands of people. All the public poet can really acknowledge is himself as a part of this. ""After all,"" says A r - mita ge , ""you can't be an unac - knowledged legislator of the world if you are sitting at a writing desk acknowledging it to yourself all the time"". Killing Time will be broad - cast on Radio 3 on December 18 and on Channel 4 televi - sion on New Year's Day.
Meanwhile, somewhere in the state of Colorado, armed to the teeth with thousands of flowers, two boys entered the front door of their own high school and for almost four hours gave floral tributes to fellow students and members of staff, beginning with red roses strewn amongst unsuspecting pupils during their lunch hour, followed by posies of peace lilies and wild orchids. Most thought the whole show was one elaborate hoax using silk replicas of the real thing, plastic imitations, exquisite practical jokes, but the flowers were no more fake than you or I, and were handed out as compliments returned, favours repaid, in good faith, straight from the heart. No would not be taken for an answer. Therefore a daffodil was tucked behind the ear of a boy in a baseball hat, and marigolds and peonies threaded through the hair
of those caught on the stairs or spotted along corridors, until every pupil who looked up from behind a desk could expect to be met with at least a petal or a dusting of pollen, if not an entire daisy-chain , or the colour-burst of a dozen foxgloves, flowering for all their worth, or a buttonhole to the breast. Upstairs in the school library, individuals were singled out for special attention: some were showered with blossom, others wore their blooms like brooches or medallions; even those who turned their backs or refused point-blank to accept such honours were decorated with buds, unseasonable fruits and rosettes the same as the others. By which time a crowd had gathered outside the school, drawn through suburbia by the rumour of flowers in full bloom, drawn through the air like butterflies to buddleia, like honey bees to honeysuckle, like hummingbirds dipping their tongues in, some to soak up such over-exuberance of thought, others to savour the goings-on . Finally, overcome by their own munificence or hay fever, the flower-boys pinned the last blooms on themselves, somewhat selfishly perhaps, but had also planned further surprises for those who swept through the aftermath of broom and buttercup:
garlands and bouquets were planted in lockers and cupboards, timed to erupt like the first day of spring into the arms of those who, during the first bout, either by fate or chance had somehow been overlooked and missed out. Experts are now trying to say how two apparently quiet kids from an apple-pie town could get their hands on a veritable rain-forest of plants and bring down a whole botanical digest of one species or another onto the heads of classmates and teachers, and where such fascination began, and why it should lead to an outpouring of this nature. And even though many believe that flowers should be kept in expert hands only, or left to specialists in the field such as florists, the law of the land dictates that God, guts and gardening made the country what it is today and for as long as the flower industry can see to it things are staying that way. What they reckon is this: deny a person the right to carry flowers of his own and he's liable to wind up on the business end of a flower somebody else has grown. As for the two boys, it's back to the same old debate: is it something in the mind that grows from birth, like a seed, or is it society makes a person that kind?
from KILLING TIME by Simon Armitage
Armitage turns a poet's eye on tragedy: crosses commemorate the deaths of 13 people killed by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, on April 20,1999 , before they turned the guns on themselves.

"Barnard, Matt",'Splurge of emotion' or a combination of inspiration and craft? Poetry's great debate and the lessons of rhyme and reason,The Times,1999-Sep-09,"London, England","A A A ' ^** ' ' . £ind tli6 lessons of Thvm p and rp£t ^nn
While poetry 's torchbearers continue to argue the role of its formal armoury , Matt Barnard finds a school where metre still matters The publication of Birthday Letters, by Ted Hughes, and the subsequent death of the Poet Laureate, were two unusual events in the world of poetry. Neither, in itself , is par ticular - ly out of the ordinary — poets die like everyone else and pain - ful , personal relationships are the staple subject matter for most of them while they are alive. What was unusual was that both events saw poetry break free of the essentially parochial world to which it is usually confined. While poetry traditionally takes on the great themes of life, poets are largely talking to each other. The newly appointed Poet Laureate, Andrew Motion, has been telling anyone who will listen that his mission is to
make poetry ""part of the conversation of Britain"" . The fact that people are more inter - es t e d in reading about the vitriol that Motion's appoint - ment inspired than the signifi - cance of the role he should play, or his own poetry, perhaps illustrates the difficult job that lies ahead. The brutal truth is that although poetry is periodically hailed as the new rock'n'roll, it just doesn't sell. Considering that none but the most famous poets such as Seamus Heaney cannot hope to sell more than a few thousand copies, the fact
that Birthday Letters sold 200,000 in hardback and so far has got to 130,000 sales in paperback is extraordinary. In large part it can be explained by the fact that Plath and Hughes are the Posh and Beckham of the chat - tering classes. But credit must also go to the writing, and the fact that the language is so accessible. As all the polls to find the nation's favourite poem indicate, most people agree with the Literary Review Editor Auberon Waugh's view that poetry should ""rhyme, scan and make sense"".
B irthday Letters un - doubtedly makes sense. However, it fails to obey Waugh's other pre - cepts for ""proper poetry"" . It is written in free verse, which most poets find hard to define in any concrete way except by what it is not, ie, poetry which follows formal, metrical rules. It occupies the same position in poetry that modern art does in the art world. Just as it is hard for most people to accept that a cow, sliced and pre - served in formaldehyde, can be ""proper art"" , many people find it hard to understand how free verse can be ""proper poetry"". Most people also believe, like Waugh, that free verse has come to dominate modern poetry: ""Of course, a lot of these modern so-called poets do occasionally doff their caps towards scansion and rhyme, but they dont use it in a signifi - cant way. Heaney has written one or two things which make
you sit up, but I think he is someone who could try a bit harder and produce some good stuff,"" he says. However, most poets would disagree with Waugh's assess - ment , not only in the case of Heaney, but that most modern poetry is written in free verse. Peter Forbes, Editor of the Poetry Review, believes that many people havea mistaken impression of modern poetry: ""It annoys me that people have this impression that formal poetry has disap - peare d . If you look at the ma - jor poets of the century, they all have great formal skill. Auberon's attitude is very counter-productive ."" Though Motion emphasises the importance of emotion and feeling in poetry, he is in no doubt of the importance of the role the formal side of the art has: ""I feel that one of the great
benefits of being a Post - Mod - ernist poet (as opposed to Post-Modernist ) is that we dont feel we have to make hard and fast decisions about whether to write in strict form or free verse — we are free to choose the form that fits the poem."" In fact, though free verse was dominant in the middle part of the century, the pendu - lum has swung back towards metrical poetry in the past two decades. However, given that most poets will argue that even if you write free verse it is vital that you have an under - standing of the formal side of poetry, it is perhaps surpris - in g that aspiring poets find it so hard to get any guidance on metre, rhyme and the rest of
poetry's formal armoury. Most of the myriad poetry groups around the country will hardly touch upon the formal side of poetry, pre - ferring instead a group feedback approach, and even some of the now numerous MA courses in creative wri t - ing do not include it in their syllabus. Motion is also head of the MA in creative writing at the University of East Anglia. As the oldest and most famous creative writing MA in Brit - ain , it is able to select the best applicants, most of whom arrive at the course already accomplished writers. How - ever , Motion finds that even they often have to begin from scratch: ""I have to say that,
brilliant as a lot of them are, they do tend to arrive without any knowledge of the formal aspects of poetry."" One of the prob - lems is that while it is accept - e d that other art forms can and should be taught formally, many people do not accept that writing can be taught in a similar way, and even now the term ""creative writing course"" conjures up images of people sitting around in a field with flowers in their hair. Writing is seen as a splurge of emotion rather than a combination of inspiration and craft. This is perhaps why art schools and drama schools are
common, while writing schools are almost unheard of. It is one of the things that inspired the poet Mimi Khal - vati , herself a graduate of a drama school, to set up the London-based Poetry School, along with two fellow poets. Versification courses, which teach the formal aspects of po - etry , are common in America, but the one taught by Khalvati at the Poetry School is one of a small number in Britain. Khalvati believes that it is vital to learn different poetry techniques because a poet who tends to stick to one form of poetry will tend to write only one sort of poem. She is keen

driving to describe the process. Someone can explain exactly how the mechanics of driving work, but until you get into a car and try to release the clutch and step on the gas, you don't know how to do it.
SEAMUS HEANEY'S translation of the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf and Ted Hughes's version of Aeschylus's The Oresteia, (both Faber) are among the most eager - l y - awaited books of the autumn. The visceral, language of the poets is expected to capture the violence of the originals. On a lighter note, Carol Ann Duffy takes a sidelong look at his - tory through the eyes of the wives of famous men, The World's Wife (Picador), and the expansive Aus - tralian poet, Les Murray, follows up his modern odyssey, Fredy Neptune , with a new collection, Conscious & Verbal (Carcanet). work well with metre you need the detail."" The main principle of Khal - vati 's course, as- with most versification courses, is that it has to be learning by doing. Many people use the analogy
""Initially I dare people to write terrible cliche or gibber - ish ,"" Khalvati says, ""because if you try to do everything at once — try to learn metre but at the same time try to produce great lines of poetry — you wont be able to."" Most people don't under - stand the language of poetry and find it intimidating and dull. As the poet Michael Donaghy asks: ""Can you imag - ine how you'd feel about music if the only way you encountered it was if you had to analyse a piece in the classroom?"" Until people are given a way to connect with poetry, the notion of a poetry bestseller will remain an oxymoron. 19 To contact The Poetry School , write to: Stuart Mayes, la Jewel Road, Walthamstow, London, E174QU.

to impress on students that the process of writing is not deciding what the poet wants to say and then choosing a form, but that the choice of form can affect what the poet is going to say. It helps to give him one of his most important tools, the element of surprise. The versification course came about because of the number of requests Khalvati was getting for guidance: ""I remember trying to write metrical stuff for ages and I had all sorts of questions and difficulties.

"Cliff, Nigel",Take That?and poetry,The Times,1999-Mar-29,"London, England","Take That — and poetry
YOU can see why the King's Head, newly deprived of its London Arts Board grant, liked this play. A new work by Jim Kenworth, Gob lobs an iconoclastic missile at the com - paratively cushy and conven - tional mainstream arts estab - lishment . Or rather at the Fes - tival Hall, which is the villain of the piece. The play's two main charac - ters —one , the Liberator, a cul - tural hooligan, the other, Hard Man Les, just a hooli - gan — set out to storm the South Bank. While Les is all psyched up for a good rumble, the Liberator is a self-styled ""Gob Warrior"" with higher things on his mind. Poetry, he says, is the last weapon of the weaponless, and anybody should have the right to ex - press themselves in the so - called People's Palace. Onstage they find two per - formance poets in full flow: a foul-mouthed American named Mike Nietzsche whose poem consists of the single word ""Arsehole "", and the Dar - ling Boy, a dreadful drama queen who cranks out much romantic mush about mur -
; King 's Head, Nl "" 1 dered petals. A battle of the bards ensues. You can guess . who wins: Kenworth hardly gives his upstarts much compe - tition . As it happens, the Liberator is not a very good poet either,
but that (I hope) misses the point. Gob is about freedom, not quality, of expression. Too much of a good thing, you might be excused for thinking, when it results in great globs of cod-poetic hyperbole, but then I suppose that is being elitist too. There is plenty of irony to lighten the load. But the play passionately insists that poet - ry , if not quite revolutionary,
is indeed the means to individ - ual liberty. This is a refreshing - ly uncynical thesis. Given the emphasis on honest and direct expression, though, it comes couched in mightily preten - tious terms. And in its own way — when, for instance, it dismisses clubbers as moronic herd-followers incapable of po - etic thought— the play is just as elitist as those who would exclude the unsophisticated from the temples of high art. But for all its cringe-making excess, this is a fresh and some - times very funny piece, marvel - lously directed by James Mar - tin Charlton with an acute eye for physical comedy. Two actors play all the parts with well-honed versatility. Ja - son Orange (formerly of Take That) is exuberantly impas - sioned , if never completely plausible, as the Liberator. Tom Hayes is spot-on as Les and the Darling Boy. The show is enlivened by the presence on stage of DJ Spike, who mixes in his own witty musical asides through - out .

"Hofmann, Michael",Poetry 's losses- and its gains,The Times,1998-Dec-10,"London, England","Poetry's losses — and its gains
If one pursued regular ac - countancy methods, this year wouldn't get out of red figures. Ted Hughes leaves a painful gap as the only English poet of recent times whom the art had, in the words of D. H. Lawrence, "" tak - en by the throat"". Earlier in the year, the Czech Miroslav Holub and the Pole Zbigniew Herbert died — poets as politi - cally effective in their societies as they were stylistically ad - mired in ours. To add insult to injury, the OUP poetry listwas summarily wound up: the ceil - ing falling in on our harmless games of musical chairs. The book of the year was Hughes'S Birthday Letters (Faber, £14.99), a book one had been waiting for without ever expecting to see it, for decades. The poems are of somewhat variable quality, but the hum - bler , more literal transcrip - tions of scenes and memories burn with irresistible clarity and power. It seems like Hugh - es 's bridge back to the rest of us: it's odd to have him writing ""I-you"" poems, finally. Anthologies come like buses — none for ages, then several at once. November saw two:
Poetry From Britain and Ireland since 1945 edited by Robert Crawford and Simon Armit -

"Davison, Peter","Orwell, the honest master of the poetry of fact",The Times,1998-Jul-23,"London, England","Orwell , the honest master of the poetry of fact
The diaries which George Orwell kept during the Second World War contained many intriguing references: ""The Germans are definite - ly in Paris... This evening I saw a her - on flying over Baker Street ... X de - clares that Jews greatly predominate among the people sheltering in the Tubes. Must try and verify this ... "" That last abbreviated sentence might stand as one of Orwell's most distinc - tive ; he had a curiously open, and open - ly curious, mind. The range and variety of his work are not in question. Here are 20 vol - umes springing from a professional writing life of some 19 years which sug - gest that, as has been reported of anoth - er author, he could write faster than God could read. Orwell himself said that he always felt some external ""com - pulsion "" to write, but the nature of his achievement is another matter. Is he an English essayist in the tradition of Defoe and Hazlitt? Or is he that more quixotic and wilful figure who, as a child, announced that: ""You are no - ticed more if you stand on your head than if you are right way up"" ? He stood upon his head on many occasions. He was a pupil at Eton, and then he was a tramp; he was a member of the military police in India, and then joined a Trotskyist organisation in Spain; he was a committed Socialist who wrote about seaside postcards and

the proper way to make tea. Yet his cen - tral preoccupations remained the same, from the time he depicted a lonely tramp earning his living as a street-artist on the Embankment, in Down And Out in Paris and London, to the moment in 1984 when the demor - alised and demolished Winston Smith sits alone in an empty bar. Orwell's early novels were filled with homelessness compounded by heart - lessness and helplessness. His figures feel themselves to be ""dead"" in the real world, but come momentarily to life when they drift down into the under - world of poverty and degradation. They experience some fundamental rev - elation — perhaps it is that of being fully human — but of its nature such a moment cannot last. Then they return to their ordinary lives with a sense of de - jection and depression, just as Orwell returned to middle-class life after his brief forays with the vagrants of Lon - don . It is often said that he felt shame and guilt, variously attributed to his privileged days at Eton or his imperial - ist days in Burma, but it is more likely that he suffered from ennui. His true genius was formed when he began his researches into the unem - ployed of northern England. All his an - ger and frustration found their first

proper means of expression in The Road To Wigan Pier, and from that time forward he was concerned with what he called ""political writing"". It allowed him, like Defoe, to com - bine imaginative insight with docu - mented record; he was able, in other words, to provide the poetry of fact. It has often been suggested that he dissi - pated his talent by employing so many different forms in pursuit of that enter - prise — novel, satire and essay among them. It is an odd indictment: no com - poser , after all, is ever asked to confine his production to string quartets or symphonies. His own style has become well known, partly from his own apothegm that ""good prose is like a window pane"" . This is a half-truth at best and cannot even be used to describe those writers, such as Dickens and Gissing, whom Orwell himself most admired. In fact ""plain"" prose can be an affecta -
tion . It is no more plain than the fact that plain George Orwell was in reality Eric Blair. He once said of Dickens that "" strong - ly individual"" writing displays the face of the author behind it, but in truth it is hard to see that of Orwell. He remains too complicated. In many respects he was the product of public school and of the imperial police force — he wrote dis - paragingly of ""fashionable pansies"" and ""pinks"", while even keeping a list of those whom he deemed to be ""fellow travellers"" with the Communists. There is something hard, almost ruth - less , about his inward temperament. We do not see a face behind his writ - ing but rather a figure who was vari - ously described by contemporaries as shy, detached, solitary and aloof. It was also noticed that he had a ""thin, flat voice"" . He had a great capacity for an - ger as well but, paradoxically, that is what gives his language its living force. His journalism and even his occa - sional reviewing can still be read with pleasure, not least because they revive the extraordinary level of partisanship and commitment in the Thirties and Forties. The years of the war, with all their seediness, fatigue and foreboding, may be said to live again in these vol - umes . Their publication is in that sense
an event of some significance, since they can be read as the history of a soci - ety as well as the chronicle of one man. This edition is in almost all respects definitive and its editor, Dr Peter Davi - son , has repaired mutilated texts and restored Orwell's original intentions. Everything is here — articles, diaries, telegrams, letters, talks and notebooks as well as those volumes which have kept his name at the forefront of 20th - century English literature. Whether he realised his achieve - ment , or not, is another matter. He be - came deeply pessimistic towards the end of his life and evoked that mood ad - mirably in his last book, 1984. He had contracted tuberculosis, and described the world itself as ""suffering from a dis - ease which is simultaneously acute, chronic and fearful"". Public opinions can sometimes spring from private tor - ments . His was in many respects a hectic and feverish life, but not without a certain nobility of purpose. He was haunted by the spectre of failure and by the fear of poverty, oppressed by fore - bodings of the future — yet somehow common sense and decency kept on breaking though . He said that he had once believed he lived in a world ""where it was not poss - ible for me to be good"". Yet he went a stage further, and became honest instead.

When Gavin Bryars started composing his First stage work, Medea (1981-84 ), he had not, he tells us, seen any mainstream opera. Medea was written in collaboration with Robert Wilson, the idiosyncratic American director whose concept of ""expanded time"" — a polite term for slow motion — Bryars also alludes to in his helpful programme notes, though not of course in that sense. All of which makes Jules Verne's novel about Dr Ox's experimental speeding up of time in a sleepy little Belgian town a suitable case for the Bryars treatment, but it also raises certain problems for traditional opera-goers . Blake Morrison has supplied r. smart, sassy libretto that could well have done for Offenbach, who also had a go at Dr Ox (in 1877), and failed. But Bryars's slow-moving , maxi - minimal - ist musical language and his penchant for writing at the extreme upper range of the singing voice conspire to make it extremely difficult to articulate words, let alone point them in the way that Morrison's text presupposes.

How far its style was dictated by financial stringency it is hard to say — Michael Levine's set consists of a few milk churns, a couple of ladders and countless balls of string — but the 19th - century bourgeois milieu suggested by novel and libretto is replaced by abstract medievalism. The combina - tion of slow-motion direction and verbal cloudiness does not make the action clear, to put it mildly. Younger audiences might think this irrelevant, ""culinary"" even. Instead they will revel, as I did in an abstracted, dopey kind of way, in the fastidious beauty of Bryars's instru - mental textures, and his gift — uncom - mon today — for writing for the voice. The music for the four young lovers, two pairs of high sopranos and counter-tenors , is absolutely lovely, as are the final aria for one of them — the sweet-toned if wordless Valdine Ander - son — and the moment of stasis before the explosive colln- ^ r '^ o^ -« experiment, with it* .. ucculun , .. iued string sound and mysterious offstage cries. There is plenty to listen to in Dr Ox, whether it is in any sense operatic is quite another matter.

Elisabeth 's Act III aria from Tannhduser shows Lemnitz at her gleaming best, as do two lengthy extracts from Lohen - grin , in one of which she is joined by the underrated Swedish tenor, Torsten Ralf. They are together again in Verdi's Otello, in German of course, to excellent effect. Lemnitz follows up the love duet with the Willow Song (variable) and the Ave Maria (outstanding).

"Meisner, Nadine",Poetry in the ring,The Times,1998-May-08,"London, England","Poetry in the ring
Federico Garcia Lorca was killed by Spanish Fascists in 1936. Rambert Dance Company's Cruel Garden lingers over the event, the dying poet tossed like a slab of meat from tormentor to tormentor, then struggling defiantly to stand before his final collapse. The scene is unashamed pathos — but it produces its intended heart-troubling effect. Lindsay Kemp and Christo - pher Bruce teamed up in 1977 to make Cruel Garden for Rambert, a dance-theatre spectacle now revived for the centenary of Lorca's birth. As well as Ralph Koltai's superb - ly simple set — a bullring that sometimes opens up on vistas of countryside, — Cruel Garden displays, for better and worse, all the lineaments of the Kemp style. It also contains Bruce's adept chore - ography which rephrases tra - ditional folkloric forms into a modem idiom, as does Carlos
I Cruel Garden ; /Apollo , Oxford V
Miranda's wonderfully ele - mental score, played by London Musici. Most of the musical and dance references are Spanish, except for an ""America"" section where Bruce includes an extraordi - nary Solo for A Negro, built from motifs of agony, labour and black jazz dance, and performed with a coiled power by Paul Liburd . Rambert has castthis reviv - al from strength, but also brought in the required sing - ers — Judy Slater, and Francois Testory — together with John Chesworth, who returns to his created role of Franco-like inquisitor. Christopher Bruce was the original central Lorca figure who appears succes - sively as a matador, a bride,
Buster Keaton (apropos Lor - ca 's screenplay about the film star) and a dinner-jacketed poet. Conor O'Brien , who now dances the role, has a vivid presence and bears a resem - blance to Bruce, although that may be partly due to the white make-up Kemp likes perform - ers to wear. Firmly in place are the other Kemp trademarks: the fantas - tical parade of archetypes; the sense of fugitive beauty; the sexual ambiguities; the drag - bride with her oblique, scut - tling walk and jerky stiffness of a puppet. In Cruel Garden these come together in a satisfyingly cohesive whole, marred only by the surrealist ""America"" passage which ar - rives with the incongruity of
an ostrich striding into a flock of pigeons . Otherwise the per - sonages form a dense, clever web of associations: the char - acter called the bull, for exam - p le , starts as the matador's combatant, but then becomes the inquisitor's brutal hench - man and, as such, the repre - sentative of masculinity and physical oppression. The programme notes make much of the solitary poet as Christ-like prophet and ; ma r - tyr , but equally implicit is the theme of'the homosexual as outcast. And what is the Cruel Garden? It is Cocteau's bull - ring splattered with blood, and it is the Garden of Gethsemane; it is Lorca's imaginary world.and the real world around him. Nadine Meisner ^SR

A uden put it pretty con - clus ively , though he named no names, when he said: ""I have known three great poets, each one a prize son of a bitch."" And yet one clings to a stubborn hope — more a superstition, really — that because someone has written great poetry, they will tend to be worth something in human terms as well. The German poet Rainer Maria Rilke (1875-1926 ) is at least as unedifying as the trio — whoever they were — that Auden had in mind. The word ""bounder"" might have been coined for him. (John Berryman called him a jerk.) He was a snob, a wastrel and a parasite , who led the most skimmingly uncommitted life. And yet he wrote lines, poems and passages of prose that are unassailably great, deep and hard. So what to do? The only way to deal with him is to read his greatest work and nothing else. To read his life — still more, I imagine, to write it, as Ralph Freedman most recently did, last year — is to have one's admiration
DIARIES OF A YOUNG POET By Rainer Maria Rilke Translated by Edward Snow and Michael Winkler Norton, £19.95 ISBN039 3045536 1912, hung in abeyance a long time, and was dramatically completed ten years later, along with its aftershocks, the Sonnets to Orpheus . But scholarship, like na - tu re , abhors a vacuum. Things have to come from somewhere. The New Poems have to come from some - where . {They cant just be new — though obviously Rilke, calling them that, thought they were.} The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge wants antecedents as well as ances - tors . And so Edward Snow and Michael Winkler, an art his - torian and a Germanist — it's a useful combination for this book, and for all of Rilke's work have brought out this rather splendid looking, fully annotated and painstakingly translated volume.
The Diaries of a Young Poet — a title given them by the editors to chime with Rilke's seemingly ever-popular Letters to a Young Poet — date from 1898 to 1900. They are generally ad - dressed to, and were more or less written at the behest of, Lou Andreas-Salome , an in - tellectual and (sometimes) erotic free spirit and, to borrow Musil's title, ""the girl friend of famous men"". She and Rilke started off as lov - ers , before she transformed herself into a sort of mentor and mother-figure to him instead; had she not done so, he might not have evolved his philosophy of unconsummat - ed love and his general nega -
tive metaphysics. Mutatis mutandis, they might have been like Lawrence and Frieda. The Diaries, then, are part punishment, part courtship , part escape. By the end of them, Rilke has broken with Lou, and moved into a rather intense artists' colony — its narcissistic, submarine and underachieving atmosphere is well-captured — and is about to marry a large sculp - tress . (""Clara arrived with her little Rilke under her arm ,"" it was once unkindly noted.) Rilke didnt have the quali - ties of the good diarist: curios - ity , informal recollection, human accuracy. Intimacy,
clouded by an intimate con - tempt . To make matters worse, Rilke was a prodigy, but more particularly he was a late developer, which is perhaps the secret truth of all prodi - gies . He published and self - published books in his teens. Thousands of pages flowed from his pen, in his unformed hand: novels, novellas, books of poems, art criticism, short stories. He had the 19th - century faible for theatre — like Balzac and Henry James — and wrote weedy plays. But the only thing going for him is industry and indomitable - ness . All his life, he had a phenomenal ease as a writer
— and as a writer of verse. And once his ease found itself something to say, the combi - nation made him great. What made Rilke were the years in the 1900s when he lived in Paris, first as the secretary of the sculptor Auguste Rodin, and then on his own. He had a stark and solitary life with humiliations that he couldn't , for once, duck out of. In his thirties in Paris, he wrote and published the two volumes of New Poems (of 1907 and 1908) and his novel The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge (1910), one of the great books of the century and still far too little read. Then his long poem, the Duino Elegies, was begun in
with him, is always oddly anonymous, just as his poems are like addresses to an Other — an Angel — across infinite space . Things that would be gifts to the diarist — a chance, slighting encounter with the poet Stefan George in Flor - ence ; the ins and outs of his relationships — don|t even appear. Whatever interest this book may promise, it is not as a diary but as Rilke. And Rilke, at this stage, was only on his way. There are some magnificent apho - ristic passages — about God,
for example, or about art, ""a reconciled St Sebastian, who allows the arrows to rest in his wounds"" — foreshadow - ings of future sayings and poems , but probably no more than ten or 20 pages' worth. The translators have done him no favours either in using an English that is actually even stiffer than the German original: ""how requi - site I was to them"", ""fun , fun, fun ... sickening climax of German sociality"". That android quality of diction is a misrepresentation of Rilke's language — though possibly not of his thought.

IN A recent interview with Tim Kendall in the poetry magazine Thumbscrew , Lavinia Greenlaw responded with plea - sure to the suggestion that her new poems were more engaged, more openly emo - tional than those inher first collection. ""I 'm glad you sensed this as it is what I have hoped for."" Poets tend to acquire labels which have more to do with the convenience of those who are trying to sell the books than with the poet's own ' intentions. Greenlaw's first collection, Night Photograph, was published in 1993: the pitch for its contents became that she was a poet who wrote about science; ' This was not untrue. In several poems, ideas drawn from astronomy, medicine or physics gave birth to metaphor. Paired stars which cannot ""touch or part"" reminded the poet of a past lover whose magnetism can never increase or de - crease . The cool delicacy of the reminder was part of the poem's appeal. Night Photograph was a precise and entertain - ing book, especially when Greenlaw went rapidly into reverse at the very moment when she seemed about to meet her reader's expectations. Suddenly you saw that she was gently mocking the set-up : ; . ""You thought the poem was about this: But really, it is about that!"" -
A WORLD WHERE NEWS TRAVELLED SLOWLY By Lavinia Greenlaw Faber, £6.99 1SBN.O571191606 .
A first collection of poems may have many weaknesses, but its strength is that it. brings together the best poems of five years or a decade. No one has hurried these poems into print, or pressured the writer with the idea that she is this kind of poet, or that. The second collection is usually more problematic. Lavinia Greenlaw's A World Where News Trav - elled Slowly is',>a book about being changed and remade by love. From one poem to another there runs a story which is. half-hidden , half-transparent . This
could work wonderfully well, as it does in Emily Bronte's love-poems , or in Tess Gallagher's poems written for Raymond Carver. Yet here, there is a strange sriltedness. The poems don't come close. Certainly, it isn't easy to make the sealed world of two lovers interesting to those outside the charm. The sense of ""we"" — so palpitatingly vital to the couple concerned — does not necessarily hold any meaning for others. At worst, the reader may feel like a a voyeur. If the poem does not offer an imaginative space which can be entered by others, and can kindle the imaginations of others, then it remains a notebook piece, however accomplished it maybe .
There are two and a half lines in a poem called No Particular Horse, which sum up Greenlaw's strengths and show, perhaps, that she is thwarting herself in much of A World Where News Travelled Slowly. The poem wants to be about the quality of horseness, so it sets itself to escape from writing about a particular horse. But it cannot escape. Here is the real horse, and the real poet: ""Running my hand/along the hooked spine of a broken-backed /roan crippled by a bite from his father."" ;.-.....

undergrowth."" (The sky is grey; I feel a little pensive.) I have been memorising poems. Memory has been called an art, but it is also a tool. It is useful to remember things: where you left the car, your mother's birthday, the num - ber on your passport. Like all tools , it will grow rusty from lack of use, and the 20th - century memory may be in danger of seizing up. When feats of memory — all of Virgil recited backwards, line by line —I were practised by ancient orators, their prodigious work was spurred by the knowledge that the poet's works were not available in paperback. Now there is no need to know him byj heart. Or is there? Ted Hughes clearly thinks there is, although he merely informs us briskly that ""there are many reasons for learning pcjems"", before launching into the Hughes Method of
Memorisation. This discards the punishment of learning by rote in favour of the more ancient system of learning by image espoused by Cicero and Thomas Aquinas. For each line of poetry, work out a picture in your head; link the pictures : let the rhythm do the rest. So: a cat and a hedgehog yowling at a harper, who escapes their cries by dancing round a cauldron. There is the witches' curse from Macbeth: ""Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd ./ Thrice and once the hedge-pig whin'd ./ Harper cries: Tis time, 'tis time./ Round about
the cauldron go ... "" You're off. All right , at first it seems a bit of a pain. You have to add your own creativity to that of the poet. But that, as Hughes points out, is just it: the memoriser's input fixes the image far more firmly than numbing repetition. Add to that the ""physical momentum of inevitability"", the rhythm of the verse , and you have an unbeatable combination. It is noticable that where rhythm is subtler — Eliot's La Figlia Che Piange vs. F. R. Higgins's Song for the Clatterbones (which takes on Jezebel) — the task takes longer. But to return: why under - take the task in the first place ? Hughes's choice, if not his introduction, gives a hint. The same names appear again and again: Blake, Frost, Shake - speare , Eliot, Dickinson (is it worth mentioning that, but for Emily D. and one each from Elizabeth Barratt Browning and Stevie Smith — unless we
hold out hope for Anonymous — it is an almost entirely masculine collection? What the heck... ). Here , yes, is Jabberwocky; but here for the most part is poetry that has become part of what is called the canon: and if you have ever wondered why this is so, try Hughes's method and you will learn. There is a reason, I discov - ered , when I took to reciting Robert Frost through Shore - ditch , that such things are not learnt simply ""by mind"": Hughes's selection will work its way into your blood. And then you may find yourself
branching out (or compiling your own selection, as p ub - lisher John Murray has in his Old Chestnuts Warmed Up, John Murray, £9.95 ), return - ing to dusty volumes on your shelves, picking up new ones: try something from Paul Muldoon's anthology, The Faber Book of Beasts, £14.99 (plenty of images there) or the latest issue of Index on Cen - sorship , Banned Poetry (£7.99) — spread the word by mouth. Hughes's little volume is a reminder and a gift. Take his words to heart. And if I see you on the street , muttering under your breath, I promise not to think you mad.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0500858989/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=c109e413
Null,The Forward Poetry Prize,The Times,1997-Oct-04,"London, England","THE FORWARD POETRY PRIZE
On October 8, the eve of National Poetry day, the winners of the sixth Forward Prize for poetry will be announced, writes Michael Hofmann. There are three categories: the main one of £10,000 for the best collection of poetry this year; then a £5,000 prize for the best newcomer; and a prize of £1,000 for the best single poem. The panel of judges is chaired by John Fuller, last year's winner. Shortlisted are Selima Hill, Ted Hughes, Jamie McKendrick, Andrew Motion, Susan Wicks and C.K. Williams. Their poems , and some 20 or 30 more , are all published in an anthology called The Forward Book of Poetry 1998. It is a subtle, varied and well - balanced list. All the poets are worth reading, and any one of them would be a deserving winner. Hill and McKendrick most resemble the popular conception of the poet, pure and unworldly , writing poems on park benches, living on fresh air and roll-ups . Motion and Wicks are both more in the world, with teaching jobs and admired prose books to their names. Charlie Williams, an American in Paris, has the toughness one used to associate with Americans before they became institutionalised in the nurseries of their universities. And Ted Hughes, living down the Laureateship and enjoying an extraordinary late efflorescence of brilliance, is as compelling as ever. His book is my favourite. It is the only one you would unhesitatingly back to last out not just the century, but the one after and beyond. His re-telling of 24 of the myths from Ovid 's Metamorphoses is clone with tremendous gusto and conviction. Whether he's writing a fight scene, a natural catastrophe or a god's sly lust for a mortal, he seems to mean it. Ovid's world is his world. When Midas's brain moves strangely, '""like a muscle"", or Thisbe's ""seemed to turn over"", you can't tell the antique curse from the modern psychological moment. After Hughes , there are the books that are their authors' best work to date: The Marble Fly and The Clever Daughter . Jamie McKendrick makes a comedy of decrepitude. His book is full of industrial antiques: a bicycle, a canal , his car, his home town of Liverpool. Its lovingly polished engineering terms and its endearing self-deprecation put it, I suppose , in the line of Larkin, but he has a lovely wry warmth that no one ever accused Larkin of having. There isn't a weak poem in the book. Susan Wicks writes about being a mother and a daughter. The poems about the loss of both her parents, all the tidying and sorting
and remembering and grieving, have an extraordinary poise. The kind of derangement that smears mustard on the roof and has moss covering the floors is unforgettable. Maybe a dozen of the poems are superb. Elsewhere, I think she has taken too much from the in - your - face American poet Sharon Olds. Then there are the poets who, while I think they may have written better elsewhere, are still worth anyone's consideration. Selima Hills's Violet is a cute diptych : My Sister's Sister about sibling rivalry
and My Husband's Wife about sexual jealousy. What looks batty and free-form actually pursues a strict emotional logic. The sister, with her sexuality (those ""swelling hymns"" are actually swelling hims), and the betrayed wife are both ingenious designs. Anyone with an older sister, anyone who has ever been abandoned, will understand. Over the years, Andrew Motion has gone from lyric to narrative to an energetic plainness, sometimes fury, that is harder to do than it looks. Salt Water follows the theme
of water: the Thames, the North Sea, the Marchioness. Its second section, in prose, is a shipboard diary, interspersed with small, sinewy poems. C.K. Williams can, it seems, do anything in his double-length lines: description, meditation, snapshot or droll psychologising. The Vigil, with poems for the death of his mother and of friends, is his most sombre work to date. Its subject is keeping one's humanity even at the moment of death: a strange meeting of prayer and analysis.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0500858362/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=7b7472f4

ONE of the oddest cult figures of our age is Serge Gainsbourg. Such hip acts as Black Grape and Stereolab have recorded the songs of the late French roue, and Suede's Brett Anderson duets on the new album by Gainsbourg's partner of many years, Jane Birkin. Gallic pop has long been derided by rock'n' rollers and there is a strong suspicion that Gainsbourg's posthumous attraction lies more in his bad-boy reput - ation than in his songs. This one-off London date at the Festival Hall was Birkin's

Di Do Dah, for example, is pure pop from in any language and made risi - ble Birkin's claim that her partner was ""as great a poet as Apollinaire"" . On the other hand, Quoi and Baby Alone in Babylon expressed a matur - er emotionality. Backed by an unimagina - tive rock band and a rather better string quartet, Birkin made her mission, harder by gushing incontinently about the man for whom she still carries a torch. We had all made Serge ""very happy by being there""; every time he
wrote her a song he was ""giving me himself to sing"". Part of Birkin's appeal lies in her vulnerability but this was mawkishness run amok. Birkin's thin, fragile voice appeared close to cracking on occasion, but that is also part of the charm. Ultimately for someone with a reputation as a former wild child, she came across as far too polite and bourgeois. The audience loved her. As most seemed to be in their late twenties it was impossible to avoid the thought that many of them were probably conceived with Je VAime...

Ted Hughes and Seamus Heaney are together again. That is the news from the literary world. A few years ago they co-operated to bring out a very successful anthology of poetry called The Rattle Bag. Now they have produced another poetry an - thology , The School Bag, and they will both be on the stage reading from it at a forum in London on April 14. What prompted them to do the new book? Heaney says that while The Rattle Bag was meant to be a ""carnival of poetry"" , The School Bag is more like a checklist. They wanted to do something which would cover ground that they more or less took for granted when they did the first book — ""something going from the age of Caedmon to the age of Auden, taking in the canonical names , roaming to America and Australia"" . The other motivation for him, he says, was ""the sense of restoration and confirmation you get from going through the word-hoard at this stage of life. I really enjoyed revisiting the first sites of my own reading , that whole memory bank of stuff that sustains your taste and your convic - tion . It was great to reopen that ground, and especially to do so with Ted.""
Hughes agrees: ""We always thought of The Rattle Bag as an anthology for young readers — or at least for those young in heart. As if we'd imagined ourselves back to 13 or 14, then picked our secret favourites from all we now know. Thinking of a school of poetry, The Rattle Bag is the playground — and that made us wonder about a complementary an - thology , one for the classroom in that same school of poetry ."" One feature of the new book is that each poet is represented by Only one poem, or passage of poetry. Why did they decide on that?. Hughes says it was a levelling device. ""The emperors have, to some extent, been stripped of the grand robes of their richly supportive other works. Each stands just as naked as the many other poets who have produced only one masterpiece. We found this made us look at them all with fresh eyes. We want readers to do the same."" ""We wanted people to see the gleam of the hoard rather than wanting to give them an inventory of the entire holdings,"" Heaney adds.
Ted Hughes and Seamus Heaney reveal what prompted them to compile a new poetry anthology, The School Bag
Also, he says, ""Christopher Reid, who was on the ball as our editor at Faber, came up with an idea of the book as a kind of flow-chart , each poem being somehow in dialogue with those around it. ""Wordsworth 's Resolution and In - depen d ence , for example, which is really a poem about the leech - gatherer as Doppelgdnger , is now situated between an extraordinary Dafyd ap Gwylm poem called The Shadow and Wilfred Owen's Strange Meeting, and this gives an extra dimension to your reading of all three of them."" Although the book does not say so anywhere, The School Bag only goes up to poets who were, as Hughes puts it, ""of combat age or came of age during the Second World War"". Why did they choose that cut-off point? ""To my ear,"" Heaney says, ""the title The School Bag suggests a book con - c erned with cultural memory rather than the contemporary scene."" ""Some of the most interesting poems in the book were written by that last generation about that war,"" Hughes says. ""One can see now, I
think , that they felt themselves to be full inheritors of the First World War, and of their national history before that. For the generation that fol - lowed , the world seemed to fall open in a new way."" It was ""a distinct and convenient watershed between the generations "". One poet who appears in the anthology has for long been considered a joke by poetry lovers — the rollick - ing Victorian , William McGonagall . But his poem The Tay Bridge Disaster is there, and both of the editors defend the decision to include it. Hughes is eloquent about it: ""Marianne Moore is the most fastidi - ous , most excruciatingly careful, exacting and sophisticated wild poet of this century. Ogden Nash is unfailingly one of the funniest. Stevie Smith plays her naive part with demonic intelligence and a perfect ear. ""Behind all these, at some oblique angle or other, is McGonagall. How is it that his every flung-away line gives you such a lift? But it does. Such
a draught of liberation. Don't dismiss McGonagall."" ""The wobble and flop of McGonagall is the signature of his genius,"" Heaney observes. There are many translations from Irish, Welsh and Scots Gaelic in the book, and both editors regard this as essential to the whole idea of the anthology. They wanted to present the entire family tree of our poetry, and, Heaney says, ""there was never any doubt in our minds that the roots of this tree are largely made up of the early poetic literatures of Ireland, Scotland and Wales, along with the Anglo-Saxon"" . Both editors also firmly believe in the value and pleasure of memorising poetry. In the book itself, Hughes gives a suggestion for re - membering a poem — invent a vivid image to associate with each line, and if those are conjured up, the lines will come back too. Heaney says that ""memorised poetry stays with you all your days as a kind of mental fossil fuel. You tap into a cable that hums with all the energies and veteran knowledge of human language at its surest and richest.""

"Hofmann, Michael",Making the sound of sense,The Times,1997-Mar-06,"London, England","Making the sound of sense
For a time in the mid - 1980 s, when his poem A Letter won the Arvon Competition, when he and Blake Morrison edited the Penguin Book of Contempo - rary British Poetry together, and when Penguin published Dangerous Play, his early selected poems, Andrew Mo - tion looked to be in the absolute mainstream of Brit - ish poetry of the time: writing poems that were talky and oblique, working on a fusion of image, narrative and voice, stealing the clothes of prose fiction. Since then, having tried — and then thrown in — his hand at fiction himself, then rapidly becoming an experi -
enced biographer (a triple header of.the Lambert family, his Larkin, a shiny new Keats out in a few months), poetry has changed for him, and his own poetry has changed too. One couldn't any longer call him typical. He has left the mainstream and is hacking his way into his own undergrowth. His books now tend to be longer, and to contain fewer, longer poems (his last volume, The Price of Everything, just two).

following in the watery foot - steps of the dying Keats in 1820. And the verse in them is pured into stout and service - able forms: rhymed couplets and quatrains, blank verse. Writing about Keats has had an effect too — as writing on Philip Larkin did previously. There are soul-landscapes like The Clearing, a poem about
the Thames like Shelley's Alastor. What you get in these new poems is a peculiar collision — again, not unlike the Roman - tics — between matter and manner. It's as though writing so much prose in the past ten years has made Motion bigger and bolder and bluffer. He is unfussy and plain-spoken , even impatient, no longer will - ing or able to wait for the poetic formulation or image. The poems begin loudly and confidently: ""This is a long time ago,"" ""I would like to make it clear,"" ""I won't say much about it now."" But at the same time, these robust poems
are about ghosts: those of Keats, of the poet's mother, of friends who died in the sink - ing of the Marchioness and of cancer. They become that strange thing: an almost impersonal pursuit of Motion's innermost feelings of sadness and depres - sion ; an unapologetic venting of his own temperament, both in the poems and in the journal, when, for instance, in a flat calm off Trafalgar, he is gripped by a fury: ""I want to stick a marlin spike up his arse and throw him to the shark which has just idled past, its fin slick and alert."" As those brilliant adjectives show, Motion has not lost or
given up all his finesse by any means; a rainy day has inter - mittent ""squirts"" of hot sun - shine , an aeroplane "" dren - ches "" the boat with its noise, a pigeon ""stamps"" in its bowls of water. But Salt Water is characterised less by such subleties of tone and observa - tion then by insistence and volume. ""I love it,"" Motion writes of the river, or, in a poem about a dress: ""I hate — I really hate—to think of some other bum/ swinging those heavy flower-heads left to right."" It is meant, I think, to be Frost's ""the sound of sense"", but I hear too much the grinding of gears and spin - ning of tyres.

Nigel Williamson on how Van Morrison and others came to put Yeats 's poetry to music
B ack in those preten - t ious days of the 1970s, full of rock operas and concept albums, it was often said that if Dylan Thomas were still alive he would have been writing lyrics for a rock band. The conceit was not entirely empty; it could at least be argued that the Welsh poet was living a rock'n'roll life - style before Elvis Presley was even out of short trousers. But W.B. Yeats goes pop? It takes a fair stretch of poetic licence to see the old Nobel laureate as an early template for Jarvis Cocker. Yet over the years many of Ireland's top artists have been unable to resist the challenge of setting Yeats's words to music. Now comes a fully realised musical celebration of the poet, featuring, among others , Van Morrison, the Cranberries , Shane Mac - Gowan and Christy Moore. The result is an album surpris - ingl y free of pretension and as refreshing as the air at Yeats's hplnvpH fnnlp
Astonishingly the entire project was put together by two enthusiastic amateurs who, with no experience of the cynical, exploitative music in - d ustry , sweet-talked a major record label, the Yeats family and some of the biggest artists in the world into helping them to turn a pipe dream into reality. During the summer of 1993 Frank Dunne and Michael Tuft, two journalists on Holi - day Which?, were driving around Sligo, where Yeats lived and worked, researching a routine travel feature. On the car stereo they were playing two cassettes. One was by Van Morrison, the other by Mike
Scott and the Waterboys, and both included settings of Yeats poems. The seeds of the project were sown. The two writers shared an enthusiasm for Yeats but from different perspectives. Dunne has a degree in Anglo-Irish literature. ""I have an emotion - a l attachment as opposed to Frank's intellectual one,"" says Tuft, whose young son died of meningitis in 1992. ""We chose Yeats's The Stolen Child for the funeral service , and I became obsessed."" The album developed from ""just an idea we had in the pub"", he says. ""We started writing to various artists say - ing we are nothing to do with the record biz but we want to make this Yeats celebration and we would like you to be on it. It was an astonishing piece of cheek."" Many of the letters were initially ignored. ""But Mike Scott wrote back to say that he had always wanted to do something similar and Christy Moore said he would like to be involved if we found a backer ."" A rmed with nothing more than the idea and a couple of en - couraging letters, the two approached the Grape - vine label. ""We put in some research browsing in the record shop and saw they did a lot of Irish artists and so picked them,"" says Frank Dunne. ""We met with the label and in ten minutes they said, we'll do it."" Grapevine laid down one condition. ""They told us that people weren't going to pay £13 for a good idea. It had to be a good record."" So the two set about drawing up a list of their dream team — the sort nf
compilation every music fan has constructed in their head at some time, with the differ - ence that this was for real. All of the artists chose their own favourite poems. The Cranberries were persuaded to offer Yeats's Grave, which features words from No Sec - ond Troy. Christy Moore de - livered a spell-binding version of The Song Of Wandering Aengus. Shane MacGowan of Pogues fame said that he was not a Yeats fan but he did like An Irish Airman Foresees His Death. His contribution is a highlight of the album. ""The poem seems to be about being a tiny pawn in the great cosmos, but MacGowan makes it belligerent,"" says Dunne. ""He turns it into a poem saying I make my own choices , I live or die by what I've done."" Van Morrison's lawyer said that the man never did such things. But when Morrison himself heard
of the project he too came on board with his sublime setting of Before The World Was Made. There were a few disap -
vibrato and dramatic pauses, and Richard Harris opening and closing the album with extracts from Under Ben Bul - ben . ""We ended up recording
pointments. bivis Costello was keen but his record company appar - ently was not. Joni Mitchell, who has recorded Yeats's Slouching To - wards Bethlehem, declined to partici - pate . But Michael and Anne Yeats, the poet's surviv - ing children, gave their support and Ijciuiiucu

him in a hotel room. There we were with this crackpot idea and Harris in his pyja - mas ,"" says Dunne . Despite the unusu - al setting, Harris was the true pro - fessional . ""I asked him to go through it once and he said he would do it a thousand times until it was
a pann - ing by Jack Yeats, the poet's brother, to be used on the cover . There are just three spoken contributions — an extraordi - nary recording of Yeats him - self reading The Lake Isle of Innisfree in a voice full of
peneci. Harris sweated over the text , extracting every ounce of meaning until he was satisfied he had got it right. When the tape was turned off he then treated them to some of his own verse. Would Yeats be writing pop
songs if he were around today? Perhaps not, but the two men are convinced that the poet would regard the best of contemporary Irish music as part of the great bardic tradi - tion . They deliberately asked Harris to open the album with the lines: ""Irish poets learn your trade/ Sing whatever is well made"" as an historical exhortation to the artists who follow. ""Yeats drew on the ballad tradition and he talked about the music of poetry. He was one link in the long chain of Irish expression and he wrote a lot about love and loss , classic rock themes. He was also very aware of poetry as a populist form,"" says Dunne. ""Poetry as the new rock'n'roll is a cliche, but the link is obvious .""

Fuller, the son of the poet Roy Fuller, is a don at Oxford A novelist and short story writer as well as a fluent and prolific poet, sometime collab - orator with James Fenton (on the delicious skit Partingtime Hall), and mentor and friend to a clutch of younger writers — Bernard O'Donoghue , Mick Imlah and Alan Hollinghurst among them — he is a significant presence in British letters who, single - handedly , has made Oxford into a vibrant and nurturing
place. His Collected Poems are published in his 60th year. Fuller has been a skilful and organised poet since his teens. This substantial volume shows the presiding influence of Auden, as well as reflecting a number of passing styles: the Movement in the Fifties, the imagistic vignettes of the Re - view school, the Martianism of the Seventies . Formally, he offers huge variety, a whole department store of poetry: from haiku elegies and a sonnet in disyllables, to terza rima, quartets and quintets, to satirical epistles and Browningesque tales, to C las - sical hexameters and a verse novel, The Illusionists, in the Pushkin stanza (chucking in three acrostics as it goes) to other things I wouldn't even knnw _thf> name nf\

when you unwind them./ Even in trousers I don't mind them.""), a suite on the shires of England, poems on chess and music, and long meditations on landscape and astronomy. Like Auden, he has his lon - gueurs . The Illusionists shows him not quite able to pull off a narrative, more a series of wittily embellished tangents. Still, you never have to go for very many lines without some wit or felicity or spark of enchantment , whether in rhyme (he is probably the best polysyllabic rhymer since By - ron ), or diction (someone do -
ing martial arts in Gerrards Cross becomes ""a Black belt in the green belt"" ) or idea (say, ""the curable romantic"" ). His facility and versatility resist easy description: You expect — perhaps — a poem like Amaz - ing , on pornography (""Such drooping and dragging ,/ Such feinting and flagging,/ Such sighing and sagging/ Saw I never.""), but not Metropoli - tan , with its cunningly prover - bial alien idiom: ""The centre of cities move westwards; the centre of the mother of cities has disappeared./ North the great cat, East the great water, South the great fire, West the great arrow."" Christopher Reid, whose fifth bookExpanded Universes is, seems more specialised and
intriguing, less of a challenge to the reviewer with taxonomy on his mind. One of the earl y ""Martians "", he has been grad - ually disarming himself and his readers, ever since his 1985 book of Eastern European ""translations ,"" the wonderful Katerina Brae. The ground-note of Expand - ed Universes is a kind of bemused acquiescence. The characteristically clever and mocking pretense is that Reid's speakers are not hurt into articulacy (as Auden describes), but are surprised into it, having it dragged out of them by a wickedly eccentric world. His voice in these short
and pellucid and beautifully written things is the one Cavafy discovered in his fam - o us poem, Waiting for the Barbarians (""What are we waiting for, assembled in the forum?/ The barbarians are due here today ."") The shortest poem in the book goes: ""One dog barks/ at hot-air balloons/ whenever they approach;/ another at night moths./ They are guarding the premises."" Clinchingly, it is called Home. For all his air of naive musing, the speaker still ap - p rehends a world in which all the pieces are cogs, and the bite of these cogs is what passes for meaning.
The venturesome thing about Expanded Un i - verses is how much ag - gression and — albeit ritualised — violence Reid has worked into these seemingly harmless and weightless pieces. Some of the poems witness it ("" one mite hitting another/ or shoving or trip - ping or wrestling/ him or her over,/ the better to plant a good kick"" ), others (Nature, Men Against Trees) praise it_.
others again seem to enact it in their spiky rhymes. In the book's tour deforce, Two Dogs on a Pub Roof, Reid rhymes for a hundred lines on the one sound of barking. It is as though he has taken the work of Hobbes, and made it into papier mache decorations.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0500429924/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=ee2f7175

A Tube platform of your own
E ver since we started posting poems in London Under - ground carriages, poets have been sending us their work, with verse arriving daily from prisons and nurs - ing homes, primary schools (with crayon drawings) and adult education courses. The romance of the Tube travels well; we have had manu - scripts from Kharkov in Ukraine, Transkei in southern Africa, China, Taiwan, Tokyo, Australia and New Zealand. But our arrangement with London Underground limits us to published work, and until now we have had to return most unsolicited poems. Now, ten years on, we have taken a great plunge into the unknown, hand in hand with The Times Literary Supple - ment , which is underwriting our first joint poetry competi - tion . New and established poets are invited to subinit unpublished poems of no more than 15 lines, on any aspect of urban life. Three prizewinning poems will be displayed on the Tube and

published in the TLS ; the first prize is £1,000, with two runners-up prizes of £500 each. We expect a huge and varied entry, and should end up with a fine collection of poems on urban themes — material for several more years of Underground poems. We hope aspiring poets will find the theme challenging: cities, immortalised in all their prosaic squalor by Dickens, Balzac or Dostoevsky, can be resistant to the Muse. But there is a long and honourable tradition of urban poetry going back to the classical poets and their 18th-century English heirs — Pope, Swift, Gay and Johnson — all of
whom wrote wittily about the pleasures of the ""dear , damn'd , distracting town"" . The Romantic poets, natu - rally , took a darker view. Poems engraved in the pave - ment of the South Bank Jubi - lee Walk, between West - niinster Bridge and Waterloo, include Blake's indictment of mercantile London: ""I wander thro' each charter'd street/ Near where the charter'd Thames does flow/ And mark in every face I meet/ Marks of weakness, marks of woe."" A few steps further along, we find Shelley writing from Italy, contrasting that "" Para - dise of exiles"" with ""London , that great sea, whose ebb and
flow/ At once is deaf and loud, and on the shore/ Vomits its .i wrecks, and still howls on for more."" Probably the best-known of all London poems is Word s - worth 's description of West - minster Bridge at dawn: ""Earth has not anything to show more fair ... This City now doth, like a garment, wear/ The beauty of the morn - ing ; silent, bare/ Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie/ Open unto the fields, and to the sky."" The truth is that city life will always have its lovers, hence its chroniclers. And, as it
happens, our next set of poems, appearing later this summer, includes three London poems: Mimi Khal - vati humming Chopin on the Circle Line, Herbert Lomas on pigeons practising sexual har - assment in Greenwich Park, and Robert Herrick, 17th - century poet ""of Brooks, of Blossoms , Birds, and Bow - ers "", ecstatically celebrating his return to London from a ""long and irksome banish - ment "" in Devon. For better or worse, Poems on the Underground is incor - ri g ibly urban, and it seems right for us to encourage poets
to write about modern life — which, for most of us, means the city. Almost every major city now displays poetry on its public transport system, a curious development which suggests that vast numbers of people hunger for intimations of beauty, grace and wit in their ordinary working lives. And the poems transcend culture and nationality. We have now ""exchanged"" poems with Stockholm Transport and the New York City Sub - way .

"Morrison, Richard",Shropshire lad remembered,The Times,1996-May-13,"London, England","Shropshire lad remembered
Few poetry collections es - tablish themselves so swiftly or so deeply in a nation's affections as A.E: Housman's A Shropshire Lad. Published (at Housman's own expense) exactly 100 years ago, it contains 63 exquisitely crafted pastoral lyrics in which the unchanging cycle of life in rural England is coun - terpointed against the sombre tread of boys marching away to fight and die in distant corners of the globe. Love is weighed against betrayal, beauty against mortality: Housman tapped into classic poetic preoccupations, but did
so with a narrative simplicity that won him a huge public. How realistically the poems depict 19th-century Shropshire life is a moot point. Housman was actually a Worcestershire lad, so even in boyhood his ""blue remembered hills"" were more a landscape of the imagi - nation than of close observa - tion . When he came to London as a clerk (his genius as a classical scholar not yet no - ticed ) an almost pathological loneliness caused him to recreate those hills in his mind as a ""land of lost content"": a safe anchorage of comfort and eternal verities in a sea of doubt and distress. That enabled him to ex - press , at one remove through
Richard Morrison on 100 years of A.E. Housman's great collection
that a copy of A Shropshire Lad could be found in every knapsack in the Flanders trenches. One can believe that. But the collection had begun to exert its remarkable grip on the imagination of English composers long before the war. Housman, who des - cribed his poetry as a ""morbid secretion"", hated it being turned into song, probably because music made explicit and public the despair which his words touched upon only discreetly. Nevertheless, dozens of composers flocked to set Hous - man 's words. And as a memo - rable centenary concert on Saturday night proved, the poet's fears were misplaced. Performing in the heart of Housman country — at St Laurence's Church, Ludldw, where Housman's ashes are buried — Sir Simon Rattle and the City of Birmingham Sym - phony Orchestra captured perfectly the surging, doomed passions of A Shropshire Lad. Two Housman-inspired pieces were played, effectively framed by Tippett and Haydn. The first was Vaughan Wil - liams 's On Wenlock Edge,
his poetry, the turbulent emo - tions that he found impossible to articulate in real life: he was never able to form close rela - tionships . What seems ex - traordinary in retrospect, however, is how precisely this specific emotional condition anticipates, some 20 years before the event, the an - guished fatalism of so many young men sent to fight in the First World War. It was said
with Robert Tear as the robust tenor soloist. In its orchestral version (the accompaniment was originally for piano quin - tet ) the music can sound too florid and overblown for the wry, epigrammic style of much of the text. But Rattle kept the textures tightly con - trolled and the phrasing fluid, and the work sounded gor - geously evocative and utterly convincing. Then came George Butter - worth 's orchestral fantasy, A Shropshire Lad. It is one of the greatest miniatures in English music, perhaps in all music: nobility and tragedy intermin - gled in a composition of in -
credible harmonic richness. And the fact that Butterworth was killed on the Somme at the age of 31, just three years after writing the work, clearly gives it extra poignancy. Although there are many more Shropshire Lad events planned in Ludlow, London and Oxford for this centenary year — talks, walks, seminars, recitals and the premiere of some newly commissioned Housman settings — nothing is likely to touch the heart more than this: the sound of Butterworth's sublimely sad music echoing like an elegy round the old stones that Housman loved and im - mortalised .

READING anthologies is a bit like getting drunk on a series of miniatures. Still, here are some strong ones. Women's Poetry of the 1930s (Routledge, £35 or £8.99 paperback) aims to destroy the myth that all the poets of the ""Auden Generation"" were men. Twenty women poets of the inter-war years are repre - sented separately, though two of the most interesting (Laura Riding and Kathleen Raine) refused to allow their work to be included in a gender-based compilation . Stevie Smith, Anne Ridler and Ruth Pitter seem the most distinctive voices here — but then each of these writers was primarily a poet, where some of the rest wrote verse only as a side-line . Editor Jane Dowson makes a sound critical case that none of
her inclusions deserves to be ignored, and her notes of introduction are exemplary. I doubt if this volume by itself will cause a re-drawing of the map of fame, but students and scholars alike should find it a useful resource. Poems on the Under - ground (Cassell, £6.95 paper - back ) collects 162 poems that have been soothing or annoy - ing commuters for the past ten years. A wide range of writers is represented — from Shake - speare to Dorothy Parker, the latter by her quatrain The Flaw in Paganism: ""Drink
and dance and laugh and he,/ Love, the reeling midnight through ,/ For tomorrow we shall die!/ (But, alas, we never do.)"" The editors report that when this poem first appeared on the Tube, they received a phone call from a vicar asking permission to reprint it in the Church Times, which would doubtless have amused the author. These editors (Gerard Benson, Judith Chernaik, Cicely Herbert) merit praise in that high and low nearly all their choices are inspired. Compulsive readers with an aversion to adverts for temps are forever in their debt. I think it was Camille Paglia
who said that poetry is the connecting link between body and mind; in which case she might enjoy Christopher Hurford's anthology, Erotic Verse (Robinson, £5.99paper - back ). Splendidly rude, this runs from Chaucer to Thorn Gunn, and finds room for Eskimo Nell as well as Christi - na Rossetti. Nice to see a slice of the pseudo-Byronic Don Leon included, even if the editor ascribes it to Anon when G. Wilson Knight proved 40 years ago that it is by George Colman the Youn - ger . An unusual item is W. H. Auden's uncoflected The Platonic Blow, which he seems to have written as a
porno exercise parodying the clotted metres employed in the Arthurian poems of his ""saint - ly "" friend Charles Williams (curious how these metres suit carnal matters better than they match their original tran - scendental purpose). My one criticism would be that there are more vigorously colloquial versions of Catullus by C. H. Sisson than the ones favoured here. The real test of a book like this, though, is the strength of its obscenities by Anon — and here Hurford comes up trumps, with all the stuff you would expect (such as a complete text of The Good Ship Venus) as well as a few limericks new at least to me:
""A remarkable tribe are the Sweenies,/ Renowned for the length of their penes./ The hair on their balls/ Sweeps the floors of their halls,/ But they don't care for women, the meanies."" No Sweenies or meanies but lots of Seamus Heaney in Patrick Crotty's Modern Irish Poetry (Blackstaff Press,
£14.99 paperback). Some of the results are too rich even for putting on the roses, but of the variety and abundance of contemporary Irish verse this excellent anthology leaves no doubt. Women's poetry is strongly represented by, among others, Eavan Boland and M 'edbh McGuckian, as well as by the liveliest of the Irish-language poets, Nuala Ni Dhomhnaill.

In one of his most memora - ble poems, Roy Fuller reflects on a photograph of the elderly Brahms perusing a score of Wagner's. The com - poser 's equanimity appears unshaken. And yet, Fuller wonders, ""how can he not be falling back aghast/ At the chromatic spectrum of decay,/ Starting to destroy already/ His classical universe?"" Fuller, like Brahms, was a man who needed order. Tidy - minded and fastidious in his dress, he lived in a suburban bungalow and worked for most of his life as a building society solicitor. The American poet Wallace Stevens — another of Fuller's heroes and
himself a man of affairs — famously wrote of the artist's ""rage for order"". Those who have read Fuller at any length may be forgiven for thinking that, except at his rare best, he had order all right but was somewhat short on rage. A preoccupation with the quotid - ian can be merely mundane. Deflate the might)' line and you may have nothing to show for it but flatness. These impressions have been revived by the appear - ance — only four years after the poet's death — of this critical biography.

He compels attention to poems that might be overlooked; and his re-evaluation of Fuller's 11 novels persuades me that these have been unjustly ne - glected . Acute and judicious, he is as unafraid of severity as of enthusiasm and has an unfailing eye for the telling detail. The book belongs, in short, to a threatened species: intelligent non - academic criticism. As such, it exemplifies the best of the values Fuller himself champi - oned . Though he moved in the course of his life from wild Left to respectable Centre, Fuller was consistent in defending what Powell calls ""a culturally enabling socialism"": a belief in the democratisation and pres - ervation of high culture. In his last years he accepted the responsibility of making this case in public, first as Oxford
Professor of Poetry, and then when his orderly skills were called upon by public bodies such as the Poetry Book Soci - ety , the BBC and the Arts Council. Powell succeeds in making this last phase as absorbing as anything in Fuller's life — as his wartime experience in East Africa or his dotty northern childhood, spent drifting with a widowed mother between seaside hotels. As biography, the book works best when a larger glimpse of society is included. Where more inti - mate relationships are con - cerned , there are odd lacunae. One would like to know more about Fuller's family. His wife, in particular, is never described and we are not even told exactly how he met her. But it is a relief to read a new biography that has no need for sensational revelations.

"Nye, Robert",Spirit and stink bombs,The Times,1996-Jan-04,"London, England","Spirit and stink bombs
M ichael Hamburger is best known for his transla - tions of classic and mod - ern German poetry, his versions of Holderlin and Rilke in particular being among the best there are in English. He was born in Berlin in 1924, but came to England as a child. Now in his seventies, after a lifetime devoted to the service of other people's verse, his Collected Poems S941-1994 reveals him as ah interesting poet in his own right . It comes as no surprise that Hamburger's recurring theme is rootlessness. Images of disposses - sion haunt him. What is remark - able is the quiet good sense with which he turns his personal predic - ament into an emblem of the general human condition. A key poem, Conformist, begins "" Brand - ed in childhood, for thirty years he strove/ To hide the scar"", a refer - ence to his early sufferings as a German Jewish immigrant, but ends with two lines which tell a more-than-autobiographical truth: ""Come late into the freedom his from birth/ To breathe the air, and walk the ownerless earth"". A small triumph of the human spirit is enacted here. Drawing on the European tradi - tion as much as the English, Hamburger's work ranges from metrical and rhyming explorations of his own melancholy and sense of alienation, to poems that abandon all constraints, formal or moral, and just go off like stink bombs. He calls this latter category his ""unpleasantries "", and some of these works are among his stron - gest pieces, notably those written as if spoken by a character called Mr Littlejoy, a sort of doppelgdnger who is perhaps everything the poet does not allow himself to be. The longer and more ambitiously philo - sophical poems seem to me to be
the least successful, and satires such as Big Deal do not read as sharply now as they did when they were first published back in the Sixties. The best of Michael Hamburger, though, is another story altogether. This comes in a number of poems in which his quest for meaning and his delight and despair in language question each other — poems as various as his elegy for his poet - friend Thomas Blackburn in which he ponders the difficulty of finding a rhyme for ""suffer "", or the poem Robert Nye

called Names where he bewails the impossibility of writing about a daddy-long-legs (""Give any crea - ture a funny name/ And not the name but the creature becomes a joke"" ), or the poem called simply Words in which he defines poetry: ""A curious trade, I admit:/ Turning a thing into words so that words will render the thing"". H amburger has an in - formed and unsentimental love for the English coun - tryside which at best reminds me of Edward Thomas and John Clare, and it is fitting that one of his most memorable poems celebrates the latter . At the Assumption of John Clare to Westminster Abbey be - gins : ""To walk four nights, three days with one good shoe —/That he
got through,/Sustained by chewed tobacco and plucked grass:/Such trials pass"". Clare's walk came when he escaped from the High Beech asylum in Essex where he had been confined. His Northborough Son - nets were written in the five years immediately preceeding the time of his confinement. Edited by Eric Robinson , David Powell and P. M. S. Dawson, this little book is of major importance. It includes 213 sonnets, some 80 of which are published for the first time in a readily accessible form. Clare's sonnets have been com - pared to the engravings of the artist Thomas Bewick. Most of them consist in fact of seven end-stopped but swift-flowing couplets , with each couplet a vignette embodying some observation of the natural world. Clare was not happy or at home in Northborough, where he felt himself to be an outcast. Yet the sonnets sing in praise of those things he always enjoyed — the smell of new-made haystacks, the sound of church bells and the rustle of a woman's Sunday gown, "" flop - ping "" crows and ""greybeard"" jack - daws , a ball of grass that turns out to be a mouse's nest with the blind offspring still hanging at their mother's teats. What is achieved in these poems is an inspired absorption of the poet in what he is writing about. Everything is seen close up, as love sees, while punctuation is almost entirely absent and the structure of the language remains colloquial. English poetry needs Clare more than ever now — not to indulge in daydreams of a bucolic past but for the vitality of his vision and the naturalness of his utterance.

"Chernaik, Judith",Season of shallow forgetfulness,The Times,1995-Oct-17,"London, England","Season of shallow forgetfulness
Two hundred years after the birth of John Keats , the great Romantic 's poetry is in danger of falling into neglect, says Judith Chernaik
J ohn Keats's grandfather owned the livery stables at the Swan and Hoop Inn in Finsbury, north London; his father was head ostler , and Keats was born there 200 years ago this month, on October 31, 1795. Some 22 years later, when being attacked by Tory reviewers for his presumption in rewriting classical myth, the poet wrote to his brother George, in America: ""This is a mere matter of the moment — I think 1 shall be among the English poets after my death !"" He was right, of course. He was the favourite poet of Tennyson and his fellow Apostles at Cambridge ; the Pre - Raphaelite Brotherhood placed him among the Immortals, alongside Dan - te , Homer and Chaucer (""the few far - seeing ones [who] revealed vast visions of beauty to mankind"" ). His poems entered Victorian popular culture in cheap mass editions. And until recent - ly , especially among the young, he was probably the best-loved English poet after Shakespeare. All this has changed, and it is the rare pupil who ""does"" Keats or any other Romantic poet at school. A few years
ago, all 14-year-olds were required to read To Autumn; now Keats is on a very long list of pre-20 th century poets. Though the nation voted him top of the pops last week , with Kipling, Tennyson and Yeats, his mysteries no longer tease the imagination of every adolescent. Keats believed, with Milton, that poetry should be ""simple, sensuous and passionate"", and he was deeply suspi - cious of theory. But he was very fond of speculating about art and life. His letters are as fresh and spontaneous as the poems are crafted and honed: ""O for a life of Sensations rather than of thoughts!""; ""We hate poetry that has a palpable design upon us, and if we disagree, seems to put its hand in its breeches pocket"" (said of Wordsworth, whom Keats otherwise revered). The published letters begin in 1816, after Keats had been appointed a dresser to surgeons at Guy's Hospital and a certified apothecary, and was about to give it all up for poetry, with the help of a small legacy. As he made his entry into London literary circles, there were dinners and dances; break - fast in Hampstead with Leigh Hunt, who published Keats's poems in the
Examiner, his radical journal; meet - ings with Shelley, Hazlitt and Words - worth ; visits to the theatre and galleries; excursions to the Isle of Wight , Margate , rainy Devon. One theme runs through the corres - pondence : his burning ambition to make himself into a poet through ""application, study and thought"". He planned to follow a summer's walking tour in the Lake District and Scotland with three years' European travel, when he would read Dante, study history and philosophy , and practise his craft. But his brother Tom fell gravely ill and Keats nursed him until Tom died, at 19; Keats himself had a persistent sore throat, and took

mercury for suspected syphilis. (He wrote to a friend in his confidence: ""You are sensible no man can set down venery as a bestial or joyless thing until he is sick of it."") Time was suddenly short. He worked at his epic in the style of Paradise Lost (Hyperion, abandoned in mid-sentence in Book 3); and within a year composed one masterpiece after another: the great Odes, La Belle Dame sans Merci, the erotic verse tales Lamia and The Eve of St Agnes. At the same time he fell hopelessly in love with the 18-year-old Fanny Brawne, his neighbour at Wentworth Place, Hampstead (now Keats House). His letters to Fanny shocked Matthew Arnold and other Victorians by their ""coarseness "". But by this time Keats had haemorrhaged and knew his love and life were doomed; as he told his friend Charles Armitage Brown: ""I know the colour of that blood — it is arterial blood — I cannot be deceived in that colour — that drop of blood is my death-warrant — I must die."" The doctors bled him, put him on a starvation diet and banned the reading and especially the writing of poetry.
There followed the long miserable voyage to Rome and the months of ""posthumous existence"" until his death in February 1821 , aged 25. Where does his poetry stand today? A recognisable presence in the poems of Seamus Heaney and Ted Hughes, he is largely ignored by younger poets; his language is too lush, his rhythms too seductive (too ""effeminate,"" Hopkins said). He makes a poor subject for the deconstruction and contextualisation of academic critics; he is too transparently devoted to art, and to what he called ""the principle of beauty in all things"". But he would be a good choice for the next set of Penguin 60s — a poet to savour on a train journey, to keep in one's coat pocket (as Shelley did on his last voyage), to grow to love for his warmth and tenderness, and the aston - ishing evidence in his poems of a ceaselessly working imagination. Shelley echoes Ode to a Nightingale and To Autumn in Adonais, his elegy for Keats: He is made one with Nature: there is heard His voice in all her music, from the
moan Of thunder, to the song of night's sweet bird; He is a presence to be felt and known In darkness and in light , from herb and stone. But Keats's poems are not primarily about the music of nature; they are about the power of art to express human passions and to assuage human suffering, and to embody the deepest paradoxes of life . Nor did Keats , in his terrible last weeks, have any confidence in a power ""which wields the world with never-wearied love""; he was conscious only of the bitter unfairness of life. Unable to write poetry in his last year, too weak to read, he gave his friend Severn, a week before he died, his epitaph: ""Here lies one whose name was writ in water"" . This time, fortunately, he was wrong. The British Library 1 exhibition, John Keats 1795-1821 . opens in the Crawford Room tomorrow and runs until Jan 28.

B esides writing poems, poets do other things. Karol Wojtyla is of course the Pope. The Place Within: The Poetry of Pope John Paul II (Hutchinson , £6.99 pbk) collects his verse in an authorised translation by Jerzy Peterkiewicz. All these poems were writ - ten before Wojtyla's election as Pontiff, between 1939 and 1978 . During this time he worked in stone quarries and a chemical plant before he began secretly to study for the priesthood in 1942. He was hidden from the Gestapo by the then Archbish - op of Cracow before his ordi - nation in 1946. These events are relevant to the imagery of Wojtyla's verse, just as his later career as a
NEW POETRY ;| teacher of theology and ethics is foreshadowed from the start in the moral seriousness of his themes. Borrowing terms from his Easter Vigil , 1966, the poems might be described as conversations with the poet's self which progress to become conversations with his fellow men and ultimately conversa - tions with God. For all their philosophical ambitions they are rooted in the actual and the material, particularly in an obviously autobiographical se - quence called The Quarry and in those Profiles of a Cyrenean which commemorate fellow workers, actors, men and women of all kinds encoun - tered during the 1939-45 war. An attractive feature of many of the poems, well brought out by the translator, is their awareness of the way words can resist the process of thought, yet the thinker must persevere: He must tear through the thicket of signs/ to the word's very centre,/ its weight the ripeness of fruit. The quotation should serve to show that this is not a volume of dreary devotional verse, even though its merits must be more religious than poetic.
T homas Lynch's other profession is that of undertaker, and while there's a whiff of the embalm - ing fluid about his Grimalkin and Other Poems (Cape, £7 pbk), it still has more than curiosity value. American - Irish , he offers memories of his Roman Catholic boyhood, as well as a sober appraisal of life and death and other practical matters (his father was an undertaker too). The masters here are Robert Frost and that fine neglected poet Edwin Arlington Robinson, but Lynch has sufficient of his own to say to make this more a case of affinity than influence. Specifically he shares with these writers an ability to make his verse sound like common speech. Only in a dreadful diatribe entitled For the Ex-Wife on the Occasion of Her Birthday do the prosod - ic skills break down into doggerel. For the most part this is a heartening book: it introduces a poet with a real command of the techniques of verse, writing about an unusu - al life in an unflashy way. Peter Reading was for many years a weighbridge operator in an agricultural feedmill, though he got himself sacked in 1992 for refusing to wear the new company uniform. The work in his Collected Poems I: Poems 1970-1984 (Bloodaxe, £9.95 pbk) is gritty, original, and uncompromising, at its best in its contempt for all forms of cant, at its worst in the way it delights in the same contempt. Reading is a satirist with a gift for combining the formal and the colloquial, and in small doses the effect can be exhilarating. Taken as a whole, however, there is some - thing both ponderous and comic about his celebration of his superiority to the objects of his satire — like watching a hippo making fun of its fellow creatures by. trying to mimic their movements.

SLIP-SHOD SIBYLS By Germaine Greer Viking, £20 Renaissance were treated with the seriousness which they demanded and deserved. Then, for complicat - ed reasons not unconnected with the rise of Protestantism, the idea of the female poet became very questionable indeed. She was treated as an innocent or, if she were forced to earn her living in Grub Street, as a whore. She was supposed to be modest and self - conscious and, if she declined to be so, she was dismissed as incorrigi - ble . There may be occasions when the reader is not utterly convinced by Greer, but the force and momentum of her argument (sometimes polemic) sweep away any possible objections. And there can be no doubting her real point. The Muses may have been female, but true poetic inspiration was considered to be an indomitable male force. ""Creation"" has always been the prerogative of a god. This is the moment at which the less intelligent feminists begin to claim that there have been, after

They have either been treated as substitute and inferior men, or as performers forced to parade their femininity like cheer-leaders of a very ragged regiment. She also suggests with some conviction that other female poets suffered from the wrong kind of acclaim. They were flat - tered and complimented to the point where posterity tired of them; overvalued in life, they were neglected in death. Hannah More, as always, comes to mind. But the central argument of Slip-Shod Sibyls proceeds as fol - lows . The female poets of the

her posthumous reputation as a measure of the attitude towards femaleness itself. Judgments of the lesbian poetess are in fact always judgments about something else: that ""something else"" incorporates the history of sensibility. There are other striking chapters. Aphra Behn may have been taken up by
""feminist academ - ics "", but Greer does not hesitate to con - clude that ""she turned to writing as a way of making a living when she could no longer rely upon the generosity of a protector"". She describes the verse of Rochester's un - happy niece, Anne Wharton, and then goes on to suggest that she committed incest with her un - cle and died of a venereal infection at the age of 2&. She is not, then, in any sense a hagi - ographer : the idea of the female poet as martyr or sacri -
fice drives her close to fury, and there is nothing more wonderful than Greer furious. She has a fine talent for invective, and there are times when certain unfortunate specimens of mediocre female writers are lined up against the wall to face the machine gun of her prose. Certainly she has a very
itchy finger, and there are scat - tered remarks about ""pretentious but ill-educated women"", ""this doggerel"", ""such inanity"", ""senti - mental prosiness"". ""The more women adored poetry,"" she de - clares , ""the less able they were to write it."" One of the best chapters of this book is concerned with the contem - porary veneration of the female poet as suicide. The cult following poets like Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton et al is the last stage in that process whereby women poets have to justify their existence by putting on some kind of perfor - mance ; but, as Greer quite justifi - ably points out, there is something demeaning about women forced to co-opt the faded romantic postures of late 19th-century poetasters. The self-imposed role of the outcast is not a happy one. And yet the moral of this book seems to be that female poets cannot win. If they succeed in shrugging off their feminine ""sen - sibility "", then they are branded as yawping barbarians on the lines of the literary lady in Martin Chuzzlewit ; ""To hear it, sweet it is. But then, outlaughs the stern philosopher, and saith to the
Grotesque 'What ho! arrest me for the Agency. Go bring it here!' And so the vision fadeth ."" Dickens's attitude is, more or less, that also taken towards the public poetry of Maya Angelou and others. Yet this risks giving the impres - sion that Slip-Shod Sibyls is more controversial than in fact it is. Greer now teaches at Newnham College, Cambridge , and in many respects her book is a work of literary criticism in a somewhat old-fashioned style. With its mix - ture of critical analysis and bio - graphical information, it is closer to Quiller-Couch than to Derrida — and none the worse for that.
But she also demonstrates an instinctive skill for the more rarefied forms of textual criticism. There is a chapter here on ""The Rewriting of Katherine Philips "", known to posterity as ""Matchless Orinda"", which has enough technical detail on prove - nance and transcription to belong within an academic monograph; but Greer is such a skilful writer that she manages to breathe some life into those old dry bones of forgotten poems. That is why Slip - Shod Sibyls is in every respect a candid and vigorous book. It deserves a place in any university syllabus where the false gods of sexuality and discrimination are still being worshipped.

WHO ELSE writes poems like hit singles, all hook, line and sinker? It is the immediacy, the almost pre-familiarity of Simon Armitage's poems that guarantees their likeableness and success. His own declared aim to write phrases of such anonymity, folksiness and wisdom as to enter the lan - guage — ""Bored like the man who carried a mermaid"" comes to mind — reminds me of Paul McCartney's ambition to write tunes for the milkman to whistle. Surely, in years to come, Armitage fans will re - gale each other with stories of what they were doing when they first came upon this or that poem — his poems share with popular music the ability to fix time.

He is not the first poet
to have this problem — I think it was successfully overcome by Louis MacNeice, with whom he has much else in common — but at the moment it is beating Armitage. A personal sound or style, a mythology, a distinctively complex approach, all still lie ahead of him. There is a lack of really first - rate material in The Dead Sea Poems: I would say only The Anaesthetist, bits of CV, At the Quarantine Station and The Two of Us are as good as Armitage's best. Otherwise, the 20-page poem at the end, F/ve Eleven Ninety Nine, about the huge bonfire at the
end of the millennium, is a tour de force, but it reads like an assignment or a Newdigate Prize poem . I don't under - stand what it's for, or why he had to write it. Elsewhere, I was alarmed at how much I was reading a style and man - ner that were wearing thin. There is a sharpness that seems as though it might want to be anguish, but in the end it remains just sharpness. The ""or"" construction to which Armitage is addicted (proba - bly from Muldoon) depletes as well as enriches, and a slew of similar phrases can come to seem like vagueness and ad - libbing . The poems have plen - ty of rhythmic urgency, but the sound quality is uninter - esting : it is not music and a sensuousness that one hears in the heavy internal rhyming, so much as the sound of the poem 's construction , the back - ing track.

D espite a journalist recently naming Penguin as one of only four big publishers that continue to publish poetry, I don't usually get very involved in the poetry world. We have our big guns of course, including Fenton, Raine, Duffy and Harrison, but this is not where the really dirty work is done: trying to pick genuine talent among the writers who have their poems published in the myriad magazines and anthologies around the country. It's a big jump from a couple of reasonably good poems to a first book that gains attention and possibly even survives into a pub - lisher 's backlist. But recently I found myself involved because we decided to revive the Penguin Modern Poets series — a series that was enor - mously influential and successful in

three things. First, the poetry world is indeed as complicated and infuri - ating as everybody warned me it would be. There were times when I yearned to be back dealing in an old-fashioned way with a jackal-like agent who has a big novel to sell: pay the money and you get to publish the book. In this world, though, there are a series of complicated allegiances — aesthet - ic , historical, regional and personal — that are a minefield for a
newcomer. Each Penguin Modern Poetry volume consists of the work of just three poets, yet of the first six volumes I proposed, two came to nothing because the poets con - cerned couldn't bear to have their work printed together. Not only did I receive endless advice from every - body about the contributions of poets we should be publishing, but the poets themselves wrote in their multitudes: from ""the old fart"" (his charmingly self-deprecating words)
who felt his generation had missed out because of our 16-year publish - ing gap, to the young woman who proclaimed that no series could possibly represent modern British poetry without her 50 pages. It would be good to report that all this commitment and energy gains its reward in a large reading public. Sadly, the second thing I learnt was that the readership for contempo - rary poetry is still pretty small; marginally bigger now, perhaps, than it was five years ago, but marginally smaller than it was in the 1960s. Apart from those poems that enter the mainstream, either through the educational process or
by fluke (Auden and Four Wed - dings and a Funeral), poetry is, and has been for a long time, an arcane art for the vast majority of people. The days when the works of a contemporary poet were common currency have long gone — proba - bly , in any real depth, with Tenny - son though particular poems of Kipling, Housman, Larkin, Auden and Eliot have made their mark this century. All of which is a great pity, because the third thing I learnt was that the poetry being written in Britain today is wide-ranging and of high quality.

LOVE AMONG THE GUILTY By Helen Kilson Bloodaxe, £6.95 pbk H elen Kitson's first poetry collection is set in an angst-ridden world of joy - less adultery, badly-paid prostitu - tion , gym-slip pregnancies, unwan - ted foetuses and mental instit - utions . While all its protagonists are certainly guilty, not one of them is enjoying the experience. None of them seems to feel the frisson that some Catholics claim is given by guilt. Plath is alluded to more than once. I fear she has not been a good role model for many women poets. The cover tells us little about the author's own life except that she spent seven years working as a typist for the County Council in Worcester. One of the poems is titled Qwerty after the first few letters of the keyboard: Monday to Friday it's like this: I've got a mortgage to pay and a mouth to feed. This is the only poem that one
can be certain derives from per - sonal experience. Others are in voices as disparate as the hero of Thomas Mann's Death in Venice , or the woman cleaner of a Wild West bordello. I suspect that Kitson's world is largely a cinemat - ic one. Her American poems have the feel of films viewed on a black and white television. There are remarkably few lines that convey any notion of colour apart from the frequent mentions of blood. Kitson's work could become more rich and varied if she devel - oped the humour and made it more epigrammatic . I liked the line ""I wonder if the Pope has a double bed"" (I'd lay odds it's a triple one to match his crown).

Tissue of tears in verse
A NEWLY discovered poem by Coleridge was reported to be written in the poet's blood on parchment made from a piece of his own skin. Meta - phorically speaking, all Mar - tin Seymour-Smith 's work is like that. His collection Wil - derness : 36 Poems 1972-1993 (Greenwich Exchange, 50 Langton Way, Blackheath, London SE3 70, £7.95) has a quality of necessity which makes it stand out. To readers of poems, Sey - mour - Smith is valued most highly as a poet. His Tea With Miss Stockport (1963) bears any amount of rereading, full of verse in a variety of modes all characterised by vivacity of
tone and exactness of expres - sion . Reminiscences ofNorma (1971) was darker and more uneven, but the sequence giv - ing that volume its title seemed inspired in its power to touch to the quick. Since then, silence. No poems in magazines; few in anthologies. But in the meantime Sey - mour - Smith has become well - known to a wider public as biographer and critic. His lives of Hardy and Graves, like his encyclopaedic Guide to Modern World Literature engage their readers in his own passion for- poetry, his understanding of its mystery and its cost in human tears. That Seymour-Smith does
see poetry as a mystery, an inspired use of language, a form of saying not to be willed, could be demonstrated by the fewness of the poems in Wil - d erness , as well as by their intense and memorable con - centration . Here, plainly, is a poet who writes poems only when he has that to say which can be said no other way. Welcoming this, we should not talk of reticence. Even meta - phorically speaking; a man has only so much blood and so much skin.
The Internal Saboteur speaks of the poet's wish ""to make my heart into the think - ing part"". He succeeds best in this high calling in the love poems which begin and end the book, in the poignant lyricism of Eyebright and Chrysanthemums (who would have thought an English poet could find something new to say about flowers), and per - haps most eloquently in a magical dream-narrative poem called Appetite of Quiet Enchantment. It was C.H. Sisson who wrote once that Seymour - Smith ' s poetry is ""the common speech of a highly sophisticat - ed mind"", comparing him to Henry Vaughan both in kind
and quality. Wilderness con - firms those suggestions. Any - one who cares for English poetry will want it. Seymour-Smith is an ad - mirer of the Peruvian poet Cesar Vallejo, who is now recognised as one of the great - es t writers of our century, though in Spain he is some - times rejected as rough and divorced from tradition. His work has a non-literary pas - sion which makes it come burning off the page even in the most woeful translations. Now an English writer, Barry Fogden , offers a com - plete version of Vallejo's first book of poems, Los Heraldos Negros (1919), an extraordi - nary outpouring from the
mind and heart of a man born of mixed race in a remote Andean town. The result, pub - lished as The Black Heralds (Allardyce, Barnett, 14 Mount Street, Lewes, East Sussex BN7 1HL, £9.50), is an attrac - tive volume. The only trouble is that Fogden's versions do not read well as English verse, having the awkwardness of the Spanish without its power. A bilingual edition would have been preferable. That is just what we get in Modern Scottish Gaelic Poems, edited and introduced by Donald MacAulay (Canon - gate Classics, £4.99 pbk). This is_ a sensible book, in that it does not cast its net wide: Sorley MacLean, George Campbell Hay, Iain Crichton Smith, Derick Thomson and MacAulay himself are the only contributors. The transla - tions have been made by the poets themselves, which means we can take them on trust. Not for the first time, Sorley MacLean stands out — another whose poems seem written in his own heart's blood, and who has shed his skin to get them written.

W ith Morning in the Burned House, Mar - garet Atwood, a name renowned in Canadian letters, publishes her first new collection of verse for over a decade. Her voice echoes down the long years of her poetic silence; her memory reaches for ideas which have been bypassed by the strong narrative drive of her novels. There is a seeming artless - ness to the poems in this collection. Their apparently unpremeditated forms flow with the easy cadences of speech. Yet Atwood is closely attentive to the nuances of language. She laments the slipping away of some ""dark , soft... Mothertongue"" in which the mouth could mould ""the lost syllables for T which
MORNING IN THE BURNED HOUSE By Margaret Atwood Virago , £8.99 paperback original did not mean separate"" . She seeks words in which sensa - tion , emotion and thought can blend and unfold into sinuous coils of possibility. It is a bleak no man's land she stalks: a wintry world of darkness and dead flower - stalks , of rolling fogs and frosted dogs' turds. ""The show empties itself down, a shadow turning / to indigo, obliter - ating / everything out there.""
This sense of desolation and abandonment gradually mounts through ventri - loquised portraits of Ava Gardner, of Helen of Troy, of a lonely military historian, until it reaches its climax in the final elegaic sequence for a dead father. ""What are you sup - posed to do/with all this loss?"" Atwood asks. The question remains unan - swere d . These poems resist neat closures. Their effect is cumulative . Though out of context some seem meagre, together they interact, one leading onto the next, a series of windows receding into the mind, each ""a little opening / for the pain to get in"". Yet Atwood never drifts too far towards spiritual insub - stantialities . She has a dry,
sometimes cruelly humorous voice. Her ideas grow out of, and remain firmly anchored in, an essentially material world. Existence, she notes with typically sardonic detach - ment , is a collage of bed - spreads and buttered toast, vanilla ice-cream and scaly knees, ""underwear / with slo - gans on the crotch"" and ""the pungency of... onions / mixed with coy deodorant"". No romantic salve is offered to soothe the sting of reality. Love is just a meat sandwich; death, the ""dire smell of... stale piss and disinfectant"". But it is in this tension between physical and spiritu - al , between fact and aspira - tion , that the power of Atwood's poetry resides. She confronts the paradoxes of
human existence head on. Man is at once a biological organism like any other and a creature who needs to feel unique, to know that he is a ""favourite child"". Flickering from tender intimacy to harsh detachment, from mocking laughter to compassionate sympathy, these poems will come as no disappointment to those who have waited.

L ike many another child of my generation, I en - countered contempor - ary poetry at school in the shape of Ted Hughes. The very first poem in his New Selected Poems is one that particularly impressed me by the ingenious simplicity of the extended metaphor — the po - et 's description of a fox moving through the snow at midnight is also an evocation of the creative process, the gradual emergence of a poetic idea ex nihilo — ""till, with a sudden sharp hot stink of fox/it enters the dark hole of the head"" . Despite his demonisation by the morbid cult generated by Sylvia Plath's gratuitously ab - breviated career, Ted Hughes has imperceptibly taken on the mantle of Betjeman as the grand old man of English poetry: Poet Laureate, the subject of monographs and dissertations, he is now ac - corded the rare honour of a second definitive compilation 'i
NEW SELECTED POEMS 1957-1994 By Ted Hughes Faber, £14.99/£7.99 pbk less than 15 years after the first Selected Poems. One could make a plausible case for Hughes as the greatest poet of nature in English since Wordsworth, but his birds and beasts belong to the same supernatural family as Blake's tyger and Rilke's panther. Yet it is clear, above all from the hitherto uncollected poems included in this new volume, that his first marriage to Sylvia Plath has overshad - owed the whole of Hughes's
writing career. There is some - thing deeply sad and yet also noble about the spectacle of a veritable master of his craft dedicating so much of his energy to the painful memory of an apprentice. She is omnipresent in these late works. In You Hated Spain, one of the most recent uncollected poems, Hughes addresses her directly, as he so often does, recalling her unso - phisticated revulsion at the strangeness of Spanish culture to ""a bobby-sox American"" : You saw right down to the Goya funeral grin And recognized it, and recoiled As your poems winced into a chill, as your panic Clutched back towards college America.
He conjures the ""grey-faced matador"" at the bullfight ""vomiting with fear"", and the dawning reality for his young wife of ""the puckering amputations/No literature course had glamorized"". Spain becomes an extended meta - phor for life itself , with all its petty cruelties and emotional betrayals, its disappointed hopes and intimidating harsh - ness . ""Spain was what you tried to wake up from/And could not."" To those who have elevated Sylvia Plath to the status of an oracle, Hughes might seem to be patronising in this charac - terisation of her: was she really so unworldly, so naive, so American? To this the answer is: he knew her best; he was her husband. And in the coda to this fine poem , Hughes
transfigures his absent inter - locutor into the immortal be - loved of his predestined bereavement. She is an Ophe - lia to his Hamlet, a Eurydice to his Orpheus: I see you, in moonlight
Walking the empty wharf at Alicante Like a new soul, still not understanding. Thinking it is still your honeymoon in the happy world, with your whole life waiting, Happy, and all your poems still to be found. Sylvia Plath's squalid end at the age of 31 ensured that she never fulfilled her promise as a poet, but has transformed her into the tragic heroine of a literary industry. That cannot have been her intention. It is as the major poet she wanted so badly to be that Hughes memorialises her. His sense of her limitations as a person adds poignancy to his tributes to her as a poet. These valedic - tory verses are a widower's exhortation to the Almighty to have mercy on the never - quite - departed soul of his lost con - sort — and a plea to give his own troubled spirit peace. t

Lesley Chamberlain hears Czech author Miroslav Holub's wry view of post-communist literary Prague
Ten years ago East European literature was the envy of West - ern writers, who felt that the struggle against com - munism somehow produced superior poetry and novels — or at least, writing where there was a clearly defined and important Big Cause. No Brit - ish fiction seemed to match Polish or Czech chronicles in search of civil freedom. But, according to the Czech poet Miroslav Holub, with political liberation all that has changed. Many writers have abandoned ""human solidari - ty "" for the kind of experimen - tal writing long familiar in deconstructionist Paris but anathema in communist Prague. Holub has become a kind of roving ambassador of good taste in this country and was recently in London to help to judge the David Cohen Litera - ture Prize, given to a British writer for a lifetime's work, to be announced tomorrow. Had his own perspective changed with liberation?
I see human solidarity, plus a readiness to communi - cate , as essential to literature everywhere. We Czechs are passing through a confused time. But for the Cohen prize all the works I have read show human solidarity. They are comprehensible for the gener - al reading public. That is how literature should be."" The uncertainty since 1989 and, in particular, the new subjective tone in Czech writ ing have confirmed Holub's traditional humanist view of literature and turned him into a wry spectator of develop -
ments at home. Trained as an immunologist, and at 71 still working in the laboratory, he found in science some of his finest metaphors for the hu - man condition. Over a lifetime he has published 14 books of poetry and five collections of prose. ""Still I feel I am basically a scientific worker,"" he says. ""My position is that I am not sure."" Unsure about the current fashion for writers to write about themselves, and suspi - cious of ""self-enchanting musi - cality "", he gives equally short shrift to the tendency to experi -
ment : ""In our literature now we have too many Joyces."" In short, the problem for the new post-communist litera - ture is modernism. Kept at bay by the communist fond - ness for objectivity and "" real - ism "", it has been reborn in a Europe which has read it all before. ""The Poles are differ - ent , I think. More traditional and less gloomy, but this is our situation in Prague,"" Holub says. The anti-communist incen - tive has disappeared, and in its place has come market pressure. It is the same ironic story throughout the former Moscow-centred world. Polit - ical commitment is not enough to get into print. ""The former communist writers are now the dissidents and see the situation as dark and menac - ing . Ours publish their cri - tiques of capitalism and the market economy with a Czech exile publisher in Munich."" The contrast could not be more marked. In the 1980s, Czech writers were widely translated and hailed abroad. Novelist-in-exile Milan Kun -
dera 's The Unbearable Light - ness of Being was a powerful modern legend. Bohumil Hrabal and Ivan Klima earned glowing reviews. I remember London and Strat - ford audiences stamping their approval of Vaclav Havel's clever, humane and funny plays. That the incumbent President of the Czech Repub - lic has these days thrust his artistic career into abeyance is another indication of the changed atmosphere. With a new novel last year, Klima is rare in suffering no loss of artistic momentum. Holub, a modest man who sees himself as rather ""child - like "" compared with many writers, is another exception. He continues to write poetry but, never lyrically inclined, he finds inspiration in epic poetry from Homer to Czech folklore. ""I like to report on an event and not on my state of mind. I try to step back and let a character speak."" The libretti of Janacek's Cunning Little Vixen and Dvorak's Rusalka, he feels, are more quotable than the kind of self-referential modern literature dominated
by m-jokes and linguistic games. Literary Prague strikes him as gloomier, more neurotic, more concerned with person - alities than it used to be. After years of communist preten - sion to ""scientific socialism"", he thinks it is also crudely anti-scientific . ""I never felt like
a literary insider. I now stick to my scientific club."" What of the British literary scene now that the old East European model is no longer there to inspire? I suggested to Holub, who since 1990 has also been a vice-president of the Poetry Society, that he had a valuable role to play in
freeing our cultural self - criti - cism too from modish trivia. But he would not be drawn. Besides, he feels a special affinity with the British char - acter . ""Of all the Slavonic nations we are the most sar - cas tic , realistic and self - criti - cal . In that we are much closer to British psychology.""

The discovery of some 300 previously unknown poems by Coleridge, reported earli - er this week, is an astonishing literary event, and would be so even if none of these largely occasional verses is judged to be worthy of the genius who wrote the first lines of Kubla Khan. Since the sleuth who has so diligently added to what was already a formidable Nachlass , Jim Mays, will also be giving us dozens of new readings of the poet's handful of masterpieces (he says The Rime of the Ancient Mariner exists in more than 100 versions), there can be no doubt that Profes - sor Mays's three forthcoming vol - umes of the Collected Works will consign all older editions of the poetry to the dustbin of scholarship. Coleridge's leading biographer,
Richard Holmes, must now be saying a silent prayer of gratitude that the second volume of his great Life has been so long in the writing that he can still take account of this new corpus of verse from the sage of Highgate 's latter years, hitherto supposed to have been philosophi - cally fertile but poetically sterile. In the Somerset village of Nether Stowey, the tiny cottage where the author of Kubla Khan was inter - rupted by the ""person on business from Porlock"" (and the poem thereby marred) is open to the public. There the find will doubt - less boost hopes of creating a permanent study centre for Cole -
ridge , perhaps in one of several other larger houses in the village which have close associa - tion s with the poet. Reggie Watters, a learned antiquarian bookseller there, would, I am sure, like to hear from any wealthy individual or organisation interested in supporting such a scheme (Coleridge Books,
11 Castle Street, Nether Stowey, Somerset TA5 1LN). Apart from his imperishable status as the most wayward and personable of the Lake poets, my
own special interest m Coleridge lies in his role as perhaps the greatest mediator of German liter - ature to the English - speaking world. He was one of the first translators and admirers of Goethe, Schiller and the German romantics and, until Car - lyle took over in the 1820 s, by far the most distin - guished . His own volumi -
nous metaphysical, ethical and critical essays were often inspired by German thinkers. It says much for Coleridge that he, like Germaine de Stael in France.
sensed the importance of this prodigious cultural awakening of a nation even as its landscape was laid waste by the Napoleonic wars. Those who want to follow the absorbing story of the reception of German thought in Britain during the 19th century — which embraces not only Coleridge and Carlyle but George Eliot, Matthew Arnold and several other major writers — should turn to The German Idea by Rosemary Ashton. This minor classic of literary scholarship has recently been reissued in paper - back by a small publisher called Nicholas Jacobs (Libris, 10 Burgh - ley Road, London NW5 1UE).
Libris specialises in translations of German classics; one recent title is The Treasure Chest by Johann Peter Hebel, a delightful collection of stories and curiosities by a contemporary of Coleridge. Hebel wrote poems in the Alemannic dialect of south-west Germany; his nearest equivalent in English might be Robert Burns. As it happens, Penguin has just pub - lished the same elegant translation by John Hibberd in paperback at £6.99, but the beautiful Libris hardback at £17.95 is worth the extra outlay. Coleridge would cer - tainly have approved of Nicholas Jacobs, but perhaps it is just as well that they lived two centuries apart — otherwise Coleridge might have devoted himself entirely to German literature and written no more verse at all.

THEATRE: W.H. Auden and Tennyson get the life-and-times treatment with diverse results
Strictly Entre Nous BAC, Battersea YEARS ago I conceived the idea of writing a one-man play about W.S. Gilbert, a curmudgeonly wit who has never had adequate recognition as. a dramatist. It was to open on the day of his death, and consist of lots of reminiscence and funny one-liners , punctuated by snippets of patter-song and (for he died rather heroically) ending with a bit of uplift. I even had an actor pencilled in for it, though I never spoilt his supper by telling him so: the admirable Timothy West. An evening with W.H. Auden at the BAC leaves me thanking God I did not assay anything so depressingly con - ventional . Nobody has yet fully cracked the problem of dramatising a writer's ""life , times and loves"" — to quote the subtitle of Strictly Entre Nous—but Vince Foxall tackles it with imagination and verve enough to shame his competitors. He, too, begins and ends on the day of his subject's death, and keeps a rough chronologi - cal hold on his life; but that is all his play has in common with the plodding and-then-and-then of most theatrical biographies. The very opening wryly signals that we will get something different. Dud - ley Sutton's podgy Auden trudges into a dreary-looking hotel room, mumbles something into the phone, puts on his dark glasses and exits, upon which the house-lights come up, as if for a vastly premature interval. The audience tit - ters nervously as, after a longish pause, the actor returns via the auditorium to a podium at the side of the stage. He starts to address what he tells us is the Austrian Literary Society in dry, sardonic style. Meanwhile, on comes a fresh-faced Rupert Holliday - Evans as the youthful Wystan, and we are under way. The gains of casting two actors as one writer, and especially this very
riven writer, are considerable. Young Auden can be articulately appalled by what he is becoming, and elderly Auden, who feels he has lost his professional and personal powers, can talk enviously and angrily back. Each can also switch effortlessly into sup - porting roles: dim father, eccentric headmaster, effete Oxford don, Chris - topher Isherwood and assorted other
lovers and lovees. And every now and then dialogue can escalate into poetry, usually bits unfamiliar to me. It is snappy, sometimes hectic stuff, which at first makes too many de - mands on the audience's wits. But that is a welcome fault in this genre. Again, the actors could do more to acknowl - ed ge Auden's dark side, and Sutton his physical dereliction as he smoked and
slobbered his way to his end. But by then we have seen plenty of evidence of his precociousness and preciosity, his confusions both professional and pri - vate , his capacity for mockery and self - mockery , his feelings of failure and futility. The dramatic scraps and snippets add up to a man.

The two words most fre - quentl y encountered in any discussion of Paul Motian's drumming style have always been taste and control. Indeed, the pianist Bill Evans, with whose trio Motian first became widely celebrated for his subtle musi - cality , considered the drum - mer ' s contribution to his music so valuable that when Motian quit to follow his growing interest in freer jazz, Evans reportedly refused to speak to him for 15 years. During this silence, Motian honed his already consider - able jazz sensibilities, both in free music and by contributing his unique sound to the Ameri - can quartet of Keith Jarrett. His most frequent collabora - tors throughout this band - leading career have been the

saxophonist Joe Lovano and the guitarist Bill Frisell. This exhilarating Jazz Cafe concert demonstrated just why they find Motian's music so com - pelling : not only does it pro - vide them with the perfect platform for their solo skills, but it also enables them to contribute towards one of the most original group sounds in contemporary jazz. Typically — and this Cam - den gig was no exception — the trio concentrates mostly on Motian tunes, notable both for their startlingly original melo - dies and their strongly percus - sive core, but it also explores the music of other jazz mas -
ters , from Monk to Mingus. The latter's passionate but slow-burning ballad, ""Duke Ellington's Sound of Love"" elicited an extraordinary dis - play of squeezed lyricism from the trio, Frisell's unique guitar sound and Lovano's c&ltured, urgent tenor combining with Motian's gossamer-light brushwork to produce a per - formance of breathtaking delicacy. Motian's experience in free music and in the bands of Evans and Jarrett has made him adept at hinting at a tune's underlying pulse and simultaneously follojying ev - ery subtlety of his soloists' improvisations. As drummer - leaders go, Motian is simply in a class of his own.

Ginsberg in this mood and mode can be truly beguiling. A pity there is not more such candour in the rest of the book.

He once described his work as dealing with ""the art and life of the past, the everyday life of the present"", and that would be true of this book, his thirtieth (he is nothing if not prolific).
Born in Brisbane in 1929, Porter has lived mostly in London since the early Fifties but the interesting thing is that for all his sophistica - tion his poetic voice has never quite acquired an English accent. I recall a line from about five volumes back: ""I want to get myself a piece of real."" Only an Australian could have written that. There are similar vibrancies in the new work, espe - cially in the second half of the book, entitled ""Homage to Robert Browning"", a series of monologues and character pieces in which different voices are made to speak. Here is literary cunning and ac - complishment of a high order. With the exception of Sorley MacLean (who of course writes in Gaelic), Iain Crichton Smith must be the finest Scottish poet since Hugh MacDiarmid. Patiently, far away from the distractions of fame, he has worked over the past four decades to refine a style that was always original to the point where he seems able now to make poetry out of anything that occurs to him. Born on Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, Smith understands the
Calvinist conscience from the in - side . He has written unforgettably about its effects on rural Scottish life, yet he is not in the last analysis a ""regional"" writer. His landscapes are countries of the mind. All this is evident in Ends and Beginnings, a collection as various as any Smith has written, ranging from a long meditation on the Israeli-Palestinian War occasioned by a visit to the Golan Heights to small but telling observations on the nature of poetry itself: ""Poetry is a swart planet/ with which we are in touch, from which/ we receive at certain times messages."" One of Smith's best poems is about two girls he heard singing on a bus — ""the unpredicted voices of our kind"". It is spontaneities such as this which his work celebrates, setting them against all dogma. MICHAEL Schmidt's PN Review has reached its 100th issue — a rare feat for a little magazine, but then PN Review has always been excep - tional . Edgell Rickword and Laura Riding head the list of 88 poets represented in this centennial number.

I suspect the fat man in the cloak and brigand's hat would have found this hugely entertaining — almost as enter - taining as the knowledge that the Ignatius Press in San Francisco is intent on collecting and publishing every fleeting word he ever wrote. This awesome enterprise has already result - ed in 14 volumes, and there are many
more to come. , ""You seem to know everything,"" gushed an admiring lady at one of his lectures. ""I know nothing, Madam,"" Chesterton replied. ""I am a journalist."" And some. From 1905 until his death in 1936 he wrote a weekly article for the Illustrated London News; for 11 years he also wrote a column in the teetotal George Cadbury'sDai /yNews , but this association was abruptly terminated when GKC rashly but innocently published ""A Song of Strange Drinks"", which contained the line ""Cocoa is a cad and a coward"". He wrote in cabs, on trains and in the pubs of Fleet Street — not just journalism, but thousands of poems; not just the Father Brown stories, but essays on theology and politics; not just plays and novels, but fairy tales, biographies and literary
criticism. ""Taking trouble has never been a weakness of mine,"" he announced cheerfully (in describing the battle of Ethandune in ""The Ballad of the White Horse"", he has the left wings of the opposing armies facing each other). He quoted from memory and didn't believe in looking things up. Early in his career he dashed off a study of Robert Browning: ""There were very few bio - graphical facts in the book,"" he wrote, ""and those were nearly all wrong."" None of which prevented Auden from
THE COLLECTED WORKS OF G.K. CHESTERTON Volume X: Poetry, Part 1 Edited by Aidan Mackey Volume XIV: Short Stories, Fairy Tales, Mystery Stories Edited by Denis Conlon Ignatius Press, £34.951 £25.95 pbk each declaring he had written some of the best nonsense verse in the language, Evelyn Waugh from rating The Ever - lasting Man as one of the few really great popular books of the century, and Andre Maurois from saluting Charles Dickens as one of the best biographies ever written. His friend Hilaire Belloc called him an architect of certitude — ""he taught
men to see what they had not seen before"". His publisher asserts sweep - ingly that he was the most quotable writer of the century. We must perhaps aim off a point or two for co-religionist zeal, but someone who defined bigotry as ""the anger of men who have no opinion"" and wrote of Tennyson that ""he could not think up to the height of his own towering style"" certainly de - serves a place on a long shortlist. ""Our Lord turned water into wine, not into ginger beer,"" Chesterton informed an American journalist during Prohibi - tion . On another occasion he had advice for conviction politicians of any nation - ality : ""The men who really believe in themselves are all in lunatic asylums.""
In their day, his poems were hugely popular. One collection went into 15 editions in his lifetime. I don't know how they fare nowadays under the national curriculum, but an inventory of the mental furniture of an older generation would undoubtedly contain many Chestertonian pieces — ""The Donkey"", ""Lepanto "", ""The Rolling English Road"" and, from the dark wartime days of 1915, ""The Secret People"": ""Smile at us, pay us, pass us; but ido not quite forget. / For we are the people of England, that never have, spoken yet.""
The Head Master of Douaionce said of him that he did not go to.eonfessidh very often, but that when he did, ""you could hear him all over the church"". At the turn of the century, Chesterton's distinctive voice could be heard all over the country; it was largely his anti - imperialist writing about the Boer War which made his reputation. From 1926 until his death he was much involved with the pistributist League, which drew its inspiration from Pope Leo XIH's Rerum Novarum and aimed to make as many people as possible the owners of property. That should not prove an obstacle to canonisation, although his acknowledged anti - Semi - tism might — even if, rather unusually, it went hand-in-hand with an enthusi - asm for Zionism. . He was a polemicist of rare quality, but he wrote and spoke always with such good humour that he seldom made enemies. To the more acerbic Belloc, his gentleness was almost a matter for reproach: ""He wounded none, but thus also he failed to provide weapons wherewith one may wound
and kill folly."" Chesterton regarded his Father Brown stories as potboilers. When, a first collection of them appeared in 1911, a reviewer in Country Life felt they should have been left in the pages of a magazine, ""where their effect, not being cumulative, would have been greater"". A similar thought may strike those who plunge into the potpourri of fiction presented here — 800 pages of short stories and fairy tales, assembled from published sources or transcribed from Chesterton's notebooks. Admirers of the ""little Suffolk dump - ling from East Anglia"", with his brown paper parcels and his battered umbrel - la , will no doubt be pleased to have ""Father Brown and the Donnington Affair"" and ""The Mask of Midas"", the two lost stories included here, but the quality of much of what has been collected, a good deal of it juvenilia, is distinctly uneven. Could it be that Chesterton's propensity for sending cartloads of paper to the municipal dump indicated a more rigorous edito - rial sense than that of the Ignatius Press?

IT IS widely rumoured that a renaissance in English poetry is under way. But it does not take the form widely attribut - ed to it by the organisers of last October's ""National Poetry Day"". Poetry ministers, to what might be called our spiritual needs. Yet our cul - ture at large no longer takes such needs very seriously. Poets have a choice. Either they can dilute the principles of their art so as to make it palatable to a largely indiffer - ent public. Or they can main - tain a steadfast concern for the intricacies of technique, rather than try to curry favour by making concessions. In short poetry can adapt itself to an increasingly unliterary cul - ture , or else that culture can adapt itself to poetry. It is an old story, now more than ever in need of retelling: ""Poetry must create the taste by which
it is to be enjoyed"". The National Poetry Day jamboree took the popular option, casting poems in the image of contemporary cul - ture : informal, undemanding, free of tradition, and ultimate - ly expendable. Clive Wilmer, himself a poet of distinction, along with the 21 diverse poets he has interviewed here, has taken a sterner course. These interviews constitute a credo on behalf of a tradition that unites Donald Davie, Thorn Gunn, Tony Harrison, Ted Hughes and Seamus Heaney with Spenser, Shake - speare , Milton; Pope, Words - worth , and Elicit.

Tony Harrison, too, has the kind of popular appeal that
proceeds more directly from classical and prosodic learn - ing than seems to be acknowl - edged by those who acclaim him as a sort of poetic dema - gogue . The ability of poets to speak for the people depends on the acquisition of linguistic skills that the people often slight.

When Norman Nicholson died seven years ago , his Times obituary called him ""the most gifted English Christian provincial poet,of his century"". This encomium is picked up, and quarrelled with, by the editor of his Collected Poems, Neil Curry, in the course of an introduc - tion discussing the nature of Nich - olson 's ""parochialism"" and its paradoxical universality. Yet this volume — which includes many previously uncoUected poems, as well as his five major volumes — proves the obituarist right Nicholson was born and lived all his, life in the small town of Millom on the west coast of Cumbria, a place he once described as ""a curiously isolated spot blocked off from the rest of England on three sides by the sea and on the fourth by mountains"". His poems are about a world of rock and stone, becks, walls, dunes, Scafell Pike, shadows and clouds over combes. Nicholson picks over his patch with the assurance and assiduity of a modern Wordsworth. That com - parison is inevitable. But it is where the two men part company that Nicholson begins to be arresting.
COLLECTED POEMS ' - \ By Norman Nicholson ;' . ' . Faber,£25: . COLLECTED POEMS' By Francis Beny ' : ' :-. ; Redcliffe Press, £25 ""On the Dismantling of Millom Ironworks"", begins asa quarrel with his predecessor for averting his gaze from the charcoal-burning furnace/ Sited like a badger's set deep in Duddon woods — in other words, for rejecting in the name of Nature the poetic possibilities of the Industrial Revolution. The poem moves oh to-celebrate the .ugly but rich reality of this ironworks before finally coming to the conclusion that now the iron - works have been dismantled may - be the ghost of Wordsworth, seeing further than I can,/ Will stare from Duddon Bridge, along miles of sand and mud-flats / To a peninsula bare as it used to be , and, beyond , to a river/ Flowing, untainted now, to a bleak, depopu - lated shore.
The language is flat and unam - b iguous , but the poem seems inspired by a - nice uncertainty .truthfully expressed. Is that ""bleak , depopulated shore"" really to be preferred to the human reality and peculiar beauty which Nicholson found in the ironworks? Is he being ironic when he says that Words - worth ' s ghost might see further than he can? Or acknowledging that there could be a false romanti - cism in his own nostalgia ? The poem troubles its reader with such questions, and is the stronger for not offering answers. Early Nicholson was not as good as this, either in form or content, the strict iambics tending to come with metronomic regularity and his details sometimes having the effect of a rhymed guidebook. But he got more interesting the longer he went on, and there are not many poets (modern or otherwise) of whom one can say that. If Nicholson has been neglected because his life's work concerned itself with unfashionable matter seriously treated, then what are we to say of Francis Berry? This poet, 80 next year, has been described by Philip Hobsbaum as ""a master of
the long poem"", and long poems have been out of favour at least since Edgar Allen Poe declared them to be a contradiction in terms. Berry does not even write fractured epics, but for long narrative poems, usually with a historical setting. His Collected Poems (available from 49 Park Street, Bristol ) has work from nine volumes published since the early 1930s. Poe's objection to the long poem was basically that vision involves excitement, and that it is false to pretend that excitement can be sustained for pages on end. Both Chaucer and Browning might be cited against him, and though Francis Berry is certainly not a poet of their stature, he has in common with those predecessors a rich vein of humanity which makes him interested in voices and in stories, and in verse as a means of storytelling through the use of different voices. Introducing this volume, Hobs - baum calls it ""an oeuvre unsur - passed in the later 20th century"". Those who suppose that the art of dramatic and narrative verse has no living exponents cannot have taken Berry into account.

In 1956, the 16-year-old William Cookson received a letter from the man he still regards as the greatest poet of modern times. Ezra Pound, then incarcerated in an asylum for the criminally in - sane , was responding to an enthusiastic review of The Cantos which Cookson had written for his school maga - zine . Two years later, shortly after-his release, Pound invited the young man to visit his Italian home. There—ever the pedagogue and impresario — he encouraged- Cookson to start a quarterly of his own. Thirty-five years and several crises later, the product of their conspiracy is still alive and kicking. It is called Agen - da and the latest issue (Vol. 31, No. 4-Vol . 32, No. 1) is mainly devoted to the poetry and thought of Kathleen Raine, 86 this month (available at £8 from good bookshops and 5 Cranbourne Court, Albert Bridge Road, London SWU 4PE).

not myself an admirer of Raine's poetry, which seems to me too formulaic for work that is meant to be visionary. But what other publication would dedicate so much attention to so utterly serious a writer, especially one with no call on a popular following? It needs courage and stub - born independence of mind to maintain a magazine that is so rigorously indifferent to fash - ion . Those virtues are plainly exemplified in Agenda: An Anthology, which Cookson has now assembled from his nearly four decades as an editor. After a foreword by Grey Gowrie, it begins with the ""Founders"" he has cham - pioned — Pound, David Jones, Basil Bunting, Hugh Mac - Diarmid , William Carlos Wil - liams and Louis Zukofsky. The list also suggests some of Cookson's limitations: these are heroic figures, but not all have worn equally well.
His biggest failure has been his inability to find genuine heirs to the Pound tradition. The sec - ondary figures in the book include several of the best poets currently writing — Geoffrey Hill, Donald Davie, Thorn Gunn, Seamus Heaney and C.H. Sisson. But Cookson is also a pushover for the genteel versifying that marks out the English amateur of poetry . If there is a triumph to compare with the best of the Founders, it must be the brilliant clutch of verse trans - lations — which, of course, is deeply Poundian territory. Compelled to select a star from this constellation, I would
probably go for the ballades of Francois Villon in the craggily musical Lullans of Tom Scott. These, like most of Scott's lyrical work—I have less time for his didactic pieces — send electric shocks through my system.

Writers comment on modern Japan at their peril, so com - plex is that society. For the setting of her latest novel Alison Fell takes the imperial court of 11th-century Japan and a group of verse-writing courtesans. The early classical period of Japanese poetry is in decline — only men being considered clever enough to write in the ever more elabo - rate forms the Chinese charac - ters have become — and women are thus forced to devise their own delicately erotic tankas in the vernacu - lar , which they send as notes to their lovers: When you visit me in winter . Don't be deterred by the curtain Of icicles over the door: just bring your sharpest sword. Lady Onogoro is a provin - cial innocent at court who has for her protector the powerful General Motosuke. Whereas bashful young Japanese brides were traditionally given ""pillow books"" containing in - structive drawings to guide them through the ordeals of the wedding night, Onogoro has had the foresight to find her own ""pillow boy"", a blind stablehand gifted with a fe - brile imagination, whom she resourcefully positions behind the tsuitate screen at the head of her bed. While the general is employed on a lower part of her anatomy (we must pre - sume he is slightly deaf for this to work), the silver-tongued stableboy practises his own form of ""aural sex"" into Onogoro's ear. His lewd sto - ries take up a good part of the book and typically involve congress with whole troops of monks, holy men and all manner of animal life — horses, foxes and even carp. In a mischievously ""a ca - demic "" introduction, Fell as - sures us that this is no fiction,
but in fact translation by a professor, Arye Blower, of some arcane manuscripts which she has merely edited. She has done a good job of recreating the more measured, ornamental speech of the per - iod , and at finding some local imagery: Onogoro's face, for instance, crumples ""like a paper lantern in an autumn cloudburst"". She also unearths some interesting titbits on the customs of the age. We discov - er that while men may have several concubines, women must be seen to act with

forbearance, for if a man has two lovers and one dies, the other may be held to have caused her death through ill - will . But despite the men's seemingly complete control of the dusty corridors of state, it is the scheming women and their uninhibited girls-only gatherings in the Almond Blossom chamber who hold together this delicately - bal - anced society and this very entertaining book. Where Fell's book is a good imitation, N.P. is the real Japanese article. Banana Yoshimoto's first novel, Kitch - en , was up-beat and relentless - ly happy. It did not take itself seriously and was all the better for it. It made Yoshimoto a cult figure in Japan and a million - airess by the age of 25. Now, perhaps stung by criticisms of Kitchen's levity
and its slightly-drawn charac - ters , she has turned to some bigger issues. We are offered incest, telepathy , lesbianism, suicide — but it does not quite come off. Events take place one long, hot summer when Kazami is researching in the English Department of a Japa - nese university and becomes embroiled in the claustropho - bic world of three siblings. Their father has written a collection of short stories in English before committing suicide. Now anyone foolhar - dy enough to attempt to trans - late them into Japanese succumbs to their melancholy nature and kills himself in sympathy with the author. To complicate matters, two of the siblings are in love and consid - ering a joint suicide pact. In the midst of this emotion - al mayhem, Ann Sherif's Eng - lish translation has a poppy, American feel to it: ""Wow , that's good"" and ""It's kinda fun"" exclaim her characters brightly. But there are some good descriptions of summer: friends sitting on a pavement, drinking cold cans of barley tea, or warm bottles of wine from soggy paper cups. And the similes have a Japanese flavour: ""She looked like a slender willow branch, wav^ ing in the summer breeze, except that she was wearing sunglasses"". She has, too, a nice instinct for showing how those banal details of life — the colour of a woman's sandals, for instance — do more to convey her state of mind than any number of explicit statements but her style is just too 'slight, too saccharin to support her sub - ject matter. Yoshimoto's 20th - century Japanese resemble twitching bags of nerves; by comparison, in Fell's pastiche their 11th-century ancestors seem to have had a very much better time of it.

THE 15 essays which form the bulk of this book are con - cerned with American poets and poetry, apart from a sensitive appraisal of 16th - century English poetry and another of Basil Bunting, both particular lodestars for Gunn. Lovers of Whitman, Pound, Marianne Moore and Eliza - beth Bishop will find their enthusiasms extended here. I was delighted by Gunn's quotatious expositions of Lorine Niedecker, Robert Duncan, Robert Creeley and other pathfinders still unfa - miliar or neglected in Britain. He appends exuberant ac -

However, my contention is that the Movement didnt really exist."" What the establishmentar - ian Movement apologists such

After Cambridge he moved to San Francisco to be with his lover, and it has remained his home to this day. While several of his little - Englandist contemporaries traded on the Movement tag, Gunn is the only one I can think of who did move on any meaningful levels, and of his own accord. Gunn points out that Larkin
""right now exercises a terrible influence on English poetry, because if you admire some - body like that so much it means you're not going to be aiming very high. His distrust of rhetoric was also a distrust of feeling, a distrust of dar - ing ."" Risk-taking , openness, generosity, imagination, cour - age , tenderness and commit - ment are among the qualities most frequently celebrated on these 235 pages, and also throughout the 500 more of Gunn's Collected Poems, which Faber is about to issue in paperback at only £9.99:
from his youthfully challeng - ing and sensuous explorations in Fighting Terms and The Sense of Movement to his redefinition of elegy in The Man with Night Sweats (1992), they are qualities Britain hath as much need of today as ever. Gunn commends Allen Ginsberg's ""humanity of spir - it , humour, ecstasy and vi - sion ... claims and preroga - tives of poetry forgotten in the age of Larkin"" — which his own work exemplifies equally. The immortality of Gunn's shelf life is clinched by the real life his books reflect with such integrity, finesse, and passion.

"Nye, Robert",At the well of rhythm,The Times,1994-Jun-20,"London, England","Atthe well of rhythm
At the age of 20, C.H. Sisson gave up the writing of poetry, for the very good reason that he was dissatisfied with his own performance. He started again some nine years later on a troopship on the way to India, during the Second World War, when by his own account he found himself im - pelled by certain words and rhythms in his head. Many books later, and 80 years old last April, I suspect that Sisson is still dissatisfied. The rest of us need not be. He is as good a poet as any now writing in English. ""My verse,"" he said once, ""is about things I am, at the moment of writing, just begin - ning to understand. When I have understood them, or have that impression, the sub - ject has gone, and I have to find another."" The work in
What and Who (Carcanet, £7.95 pbk original) bears out this self-appraisal . Here are poems about old age and mortality which look unflinch - ingly at those conditions, but which read like beginnings. Sisson's finest verse has always been about sex and God, about (in Eliot's phrase) birth, and copulation, and death. He would probably subscribe to Eliot's insistence: That's all the facts when you come to brass tacks. In other words, Sisson is a poet con - cerned with the eternal verities of the human condition, say - ing something new by virtue of the personal passion which he brings to their expression, which newness is marked by the slight shifts in rhythm which make him not quite like anyone else. ""The man that was the same in Neolithic and in Roman times, as now, is of more interest than the freak of
circumstances,"" he has writ - ten . ""This truth lies at the bottom of a well of rhythm."" . Trying to convey Sisson's flavour , I always find myself quoting his lines to Catullus, where the Latin poet is seen sympathetically as my friend
POETRY across twenty centuries/ Anx ious to complete your lechery before Christ came. This vale - diction is crucial, since much of Sisson's work has been an attempt to return to souce and reknit Christianity to the pa - gan world, or perhaps rather to explore the relationship of the flesh of paganism and the religion of the Incarnation.
That work continues unabated in What and Who, a most remarkable volume by any standards. Five years younger than Sisson, John Heath-Stubbs has some of the same concerns and a touch of the same liveliness. He is a master of traditional verse forms, and his new book Sweetapple Earth (Carcanet, £7.95 pbk) even contains a series, of limericks on the plots of op - eras , the most memorable being ""Don Giovanni"": That night, when the trap - door stuck fast . In Dublin, we all were aghast,
Till a voice from the 'gods' Started shouting the odds: 'Thank heaven, hell's full up at last!' This .is amusing, and so is Heath-Stubbs 's versified list of the Poets Laureate, not to speak of a number of reflec - tions on flowers and classical history and the birthdays of his friends. If you are looking for well-made light and occa - sional verse, then this is the volume for you. Vernon Scannell is no doubt the only English poet ever to have made a living as a boxer in fairground booths. If that leads you to expect a certain pugnaciousness of his verse, then his Collected Poems 1950-1993 (Robson, £14.95 pbk original) should not prove disappointing. I like the embattled tender - ness of the handful of love poems included here which succeed in the difficult busi - ness of being personal without being coy or messy. He also
writes well about guilt and remorse, most notably in ""A Case of Murder"". His verse has its feet on the ground, almost to a fault in that the rhythms are too often predict - able . All the same, the decency of Scanner's concern to find meaning in the occasions of everyday life is self-evident , and his work stands out from the ruck by reason of its careful craftsmanship. Dennis O'Driscoll works in Dublin Castle, where he man - ages the Stamp Duty Adjudi - cation office. His verse has an unusual acerbity when it comes to engaging with every - day life and his Long Story Short (Anvil, £7.95 pbk origi - nal ) deserves attention for that reason. Discursive in feeling yet imagist in technique, poems such as those in the two sequences ""Breviary"" and ""Rose Windows"" manage to express compassion without the least taint of sentimental - ity . James Joyce had a word for it: jocoserious.

Poetry of New York 's airwaves
M anhattan's cultur - al landmarks are always under siege by the forces of profit and space, but the potential demise of WNYC, the city's oldest classical music sta - tion — it's been going 50 years — caused ructions unmatched since Mia left Woody. The threat to the station's frequencies came, ironical - ly , when plans for a celebra - tion concert were already fixed. So the fiftieth anniver - sary began with a message from the mayor declaring not only that the station was saved, but that he had named this Official WNYC Day. If further proof were needed of the central role of 93.9FM on the dial of every civilised radio, the three hours of new music that followed contained it. John Schaefer, the young, ponytailed music program - mer , is responsible for much of the station's hip status and high listening figures, and this birthday concert showed the range of his imagination and con - nections . Schaefer managed to commission 12 of Ameri -
ca s most .celebrated com - posers to write pieces especially for this event, none exceeding ten minutes, and all based on the same poem — No Longer Very Clear by John Ashbery. The equivalent would be Classic FM (which dreams of being WNYC if it grows up and gets lucky) persuad - ing Seamus Heaney to write an ode, and then getting everyone from Sir Michael Tippett to Brian Eno to set it to music. First Ashbery read his 18 - line , four-stanza poem, cryptic, romantic and highly moody at the same time. He also admitted he had listened to nothing but WNYC since he moved to the city in 1949. This hint of nostalgia was confirmed by a sound collage of archival material, an interview with Bob Dylan juxtaposed with Ma Bart6k and, even more improbably, Elvis Presley sharing a studio with Mrs Franklin Roosevelt. The actual compositions demonstrated in textbook
50 th Anniversary Concert WNYC Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center , New York fashion the full range of musical styles in operation, everything from Laurie An - derson to John Corigliano's all-female bassoon quartet. The notion of a hardcore Modernist like Milton Bab - bitt sharing the billing with Philip Glass is more shock - ing than Dylan and Bart6k. As it was, Glass delivered a sentimental, typically riff - driven piano solo, and Bab - bitt used soprano Cheryl Marshall and his usual
dissonant twinkle. The concert proved that outstanding work is being done in every zone, whether a snappy rag by longtime establishment figure Mor - ton Gould, or Robin Hol - comb 's balladeering, reminiscent of Ricky Lee Jones, accompanied by drums and Bill Frisell's electric guitar. Anthony Da - vis , best known as the composer of the Malcolm X opera, created a charming study for piano, clarinet and soprano far from his avant - iazz roots.
It was fascinating to see each composer dealing with the poem, writing solely instrumental work, or just setting one vowel, as with Raphael MostePs True No performed on Tibetan singing bowls and shofar. Peter Schickele, inventor of PDQ Bach, delivered a Steinway-smasher for six hands, and the ivories were equally under attack with Ursula Oppen's breathtak - ing race through ""like a... an engine"" by Joan Tower. It is only to be hoped that in another 50 years New York will still be able to sustain a station of this quality, and that just as many, if not more, types of music will be there to cele - brate it.

H ugo Williams's latest collection, Dock Lea ves, is dedicated to his mother, who died last year. Margaret Vyner, a beautiful Australian model, married the actor Hugh Williams and they wrote a string of successful plays together in the late Fifties. Most of the new poems are about their family life. The dock leaves of the title are the remedy for the child - hood pain of a nettle sting. One of the main traits of Williams's poetry is his ability to slip back to the past as effortlessly as a dreamer. In ""Old Boy"" he finds himself back at school, complete with grey hair,. a wife and motor - bike . Using time in this way fulfils two functions. On the surface there is nostalgia for the past, where things were better than the present, like the Beatles's ""Oh I believe in yesterday!"" On another level.
writing about old hurts be - comes a sort of therapy. In the opening poem, ""On Your Marks"", Williams writes ""I start furthest back."" The logical reason for the delayed start is the fact that he is older than his brother and sister, yet the phrase conveys a sense of inadequacy. Though his fam - ily life seems -privileged , his unhappiness lay chiefly in his inability to become an actor and fit into the bright-ami brittle world of the stage.

"Morrison, Richard",Bonfire of the vanity press,The Times,1994-Jun-11,"London, England","Bonfire of the vanity press
Anew definition of ""vanity publishing"" was offered by some - body the other day: ugly journalists who write col - umns with little pictures of themselves at the top. Well, um, quite. The real thing, however — vanity publish - ing , I mean, not my double - c hin — is even more grotesque. That is revealed in an intriguing new book by Johnathon Clifford, who runs the National Poetry Foundation. Vanity Press and The Proper Poetry Publishers starts from two premises: that there will always be people who will write awful poetry and yet be blind to its total lack of merit and that there will always be ""pub - l ishers "" (if we can dignify them thus) who will take advantage of the poets' gull -
ibility , and sting them for thousands of pounds. Serve the awful poets right, you say. Well, per - haps . It is true that Clifford lists plenty of genuine poet - r y publishers who will give an honest (if ego - detonat - ing ) appraisal of a literary effort before publishing it — or , more likely , refusing to publish it. But then he demonstrates just how dodgy the recruiting meth - ods of some vanity publish - ers are — by playing a jolly jape on them. To every vanity publisher advertising in the national press he sent a collection of 40 poems (he charitably does not name the ""poet"", who is clearly a good sport). Their style and quality you may judge from the follow - ing haunting lines:
Watch the warm springtime rain, Streaking across the windowpane. Falling gentle to the ground Replenishing plants that abound . As F.R. Leavis probably would not have said, Keats it aint. Just to add a little more spice to the exercise, where a publisher asked for 64 poems to be submitted, Clifford sent 40, and 25 duplicates . Few publishers appeared to notice this. You will have guessed what sort of replies he
received . ""Explosively apoc - alyptic language... a great source of inspiration,"" one publisher gushed. Other typical effusions were ""rhyme and cadence are employed to great effect"", ""the work is strongly imag - ist "", ""these poems will sure - ly cause the reader to think and feel deeply about the current state of society"" — and so on. Clifford then compared the vanity publishers' prices with those an average print - er would charge if you published your poetry your - self . One vanity publisher, for instance, asked the au - thor for £4,000 for a print - run of 1,000 copies. ' A printer quoted £1,250 for the same work. So who on earth would fall for all this? Unfor - tunately , hundreds of people — judging by the number of prosperous vani -
ty publishers whom Clifford contacted . In fact, aren't the very people who write naive poetry (and naive novels too, for that matter) also likely to enter into naive business transactions? I fear that there may be a correlation. Clifford wants newspa - pers to verify the credentials of publishers before allow - ing their advertisements to be published. This won't happen, of course. Most editors have enough trouble keeping tabs on their jour - nalists ' methods without being held responsible for the ethics of the advertisers too. But Clifford's book (details 0329 822218) should be read by all those thinking of leaping into print at their ownexpenss . Incidentally , he is pub - lishing and distributing it himself . Doni even whisper the word vanity.

Pulp thriller with poetry
FOR a band once labelled as the ""escape party from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", Pulp are doing very nicely, thank you. His'n'Hers , their debut al - bum for a major label, is sirring comfortably in the charts, and moody romantics have elevated Pulp's lead singer, Jarvis Cocker, to the pantheon of rock's sex gods. He has, of course, all the requirements. Cocker is tall and willowy, a dandy who wears an expression of per - manent angst . Acute observa - tions about love, sex, dreamy days and dreary days fill His 'n' Hers. The band play a glammed-up pop, halfway between Morrissey and
Suede. Candida Doyle's sea - side organ accompaniments and Russell Senior's violin provide Pulp's languid, fluid lines while drummer Nick Banks and bassist Steve Mackey give the band a solid, earthy feel.. Unlike most front men, however, Cocker has an un - usual idea of the kind of rapport he wants with Pulp's audience . ""One question be - fore we start"", he asks before launching into the opening number, ""Joyriders "". ""Why are you here? To participate or spectate?"" There is little
Pulp The Forum, NW5 room in the hall for the audience to express their full participatory intentions, so they jump up and down. Cocker finishes the song with a deep bow. ""You see"", he begins saying, ""we want this to be an event, something that's unique."" A thousand begin to jump approvingly. A lone voice shrills out: ""Jarvis ! I love you!"" With pauses only for Cock -
er 's between-song reflections about sex education and the symptomatology of Ikea shoppers, Pulp's focus is, not unnaturally , on material from His'n'Hers . Cocker's jerky mobility evens out as the set progresses. Songs like ""Do You Remember The First Time?"" and ""Lipgloss "" have a finely tuned dramatic impetus, and Senior and Doyle together add a swoony texture . This is the final concert on a short spring tour, and Pulp's gang from Sheffield are all present. The sight of a
journalist's notebook elicits some strange confessions. Gary wants to tell me that it is his Stylophone that Doyle is poking on ""She's A Lady"". His Stylophone is bigger and better than, say, the one Rolf Harr is once used. The song accentuates what is best about Pulp. Cocker's lyrics are those of a home - grown Jacques Brel and his delivery develops the requi - site passion well. Encores pass by gracefully and Cock - er promises that Pulp will be back , ""when the leaves are falling"". It is a poetic goodbye that is entirely in keeping with the Pulp spirit.

THESE five books offer per - s o nal views, reflected through different jalis (screens) on different episodes of India's disjointed past. Grandmother's Footsteps (Macmillan, £20) retraces a journey that Penelope Betje - man , wife of the Poet Laure - ate , made through India with her granddaughter, Imogen Lycett-Green . Penelope first went to India in 1928 aged 18 when her father, Field Mar - shal Lord Chetwode, was ap - pointed Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army. Despite herself, she fell in love with the country, and her association
continued throughout her life. She regularly led tours and expeditions until her death in the lower Himalayas in 1986. The book weaves together snippets about Lady Betje - man 's travels in India, her friends, her involvement in the magical Kulu valley and her disillusionment with ""pro - gress "" in the rural areas. This produces an affectionate mem - oir by a devoted and loyal granddaughter and does the grand old lady proud. The unceasing eulogy , however , makes the reader yearn for a more rounded study of Lady Betjeman and her involve - men t with India. .
Lord Curzon, the former Viceroy, claimed that the Indi - an subcontinent had ""the greatest galaxy of monuments in the world"". Today, sadly much of this heritage is in - creasingly threatened as the burgeoning population puts survival and industrialisation above care of old sites. In Great Monuments of India, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan and Shri Lanka (Odyssey, £19.95) Shobita Punja presents his - torical , religious and architec - tural information on her favourite sites, from the obvi - ous to the more obscure. The book is written with clarity and enthusiasm, with good photographs and illustrations, but can only be used to visit a fraction of the monuments in the five countries and is not a comprehensive travel-aid . Some of the greatest patrons of art and architecture were the Mughal emperors who ruled for several hundred years. Dara Shukoh (Banyan, £14.95, available from Books from India, 45 Museum Street , London Wl) is a play in English rhyming verse by
Gopal Gandhi, the grandson of Mahatma Gandhi. It encap - sulates the grandeur and the violence of the Mughal dynas - ty in an original , moving and elegant way. Dara Shukoh, eldest son of the 17th-century Moghul emperor Shah Jahan, aesthete, poet and passionate believer in Hindu-Muslim unity, was the heir apparent. Despite these qualities, his brother, Aurengzeb, the un - scrupulous intriguer, cool pol - itician and katthar (diehard) Muslim, outmanoeuvred and killed him. He reasserted Muslim superiority over the majority Hindu population, sharpening religious division which has left its mark today. The richness and depth of the play makes it readable in its own right, bringing to life the struggle between the two brothers, both political and symbolic . Its structure paral - lels John Dryden's play Aurengzeb and the dramatic tension echoes Shakespearean tragedies. On stage it should
take on an even larger life. Aurengzeb's death in 1707 opened the doors to greater British involvement which is the subject of the other three books. After the 1857 Mutiny, effective administration of the country and its 300 million inhabitants was put in the hands of the 1000 officers (or Civilians) of the Indian Civil Service (ICS). They remained in control until Independence in 1947, making them the most powerful body of bureaucrats in the English-speaking world. With Whitehall far removed and individual offi - cers left largely to their own resources by the Viceregal establishment, they became effective arbiters of British administration and justice. ""Perhaps they would have been happier if they had never gone out to India, but the Raj also brought out the best in them.:. It turned clerks into pro-consuls , traders into mer - chant princes and daydream - ers into philosopher kings.""
Clive Dewey's Anglo - Indi - an Attitudes: the Mind of the Indian Civil Service (Ham - bledon Press, £25) explores the approaches of two middle ranking Civilians who reflect - ed the two faces of British imperialism: ""the Gospel of Uplift and the cult of friend - ship "". F.I. Brayne despised In - dian culture and thought individual Indians were sunk in sin. Sir Malcolm Darling was a cultivated humanist, despised his compatriots and thought Indians were sensi - tive and imaginative. He had a life-long friendship with the Maharaja of Dewas Senior, for whom E.M. Forster wor - ked . Despite its dedication, Dewey believes the ICS was not effective because it applied intellectual frameworks learnt in England and absorbed little from lifetimes in the east. This is one of the few serious assessments of the ICS. Al - though weakened by tackling too many disparate themes, it is nevertheless a thought - pro - voking and original work, controversial with former Imperial servants or modern
Indian historians. After Inde - pendence the ICS gave way to the IAS; although more Indian it faces the same fundamental question: should India take on the mores of the Western world, or should it look within to solve its problems? The IAS has still not resolved this dilemma. In Viceregal India, 1916 - 1921 : The Letters of Ralph Verney, Volume 2 (Tabb House , £20) is a fine example of that rather unique but now sadly dying English art form: letter writing. It contains a collection of letters between
Ralph Verney and his family while he was military secre - tary to the then Viceroy, Lord Chelmsford, edited by his son David. Verney records some of the events, major and trivial, that made up his personal life while responsible for running the Viceregal establishment at the . peak of its power. They range from the purchase of a new uniform for £600 to the organisation of Viceregal tours. Surprisingly, the letters provide little analysis of the changing political scene, even of the historically important Montagu-Chelmsford consti - tutional reforms.

As Barnaby, subject of this dramatic memoir, sourly points out, these would-be healers never used "" homosex - ual "" as a noun, only as an adjective followed by ""leanings "", ""tendencies"" or ""proclivities"". But anyway, dear, rest assured, it's only a passing phase. This is not how the 21 - year - old Barnaby sees his position. Pippa takes him to Fortnums, Rosamund offers scones in North Oxford, Father X and Father Y bleat their platitudes, but he is whirling between the maelstrom of desires and the rocks of self-disgust . Eventual - ly the rocks claim their victim. The setting is Barnaby's rooms in an Oxford college, persuasively re-created by Jane Wildgoose, and Quentin walks up to the table where books, LPs and folded clothes are spread, and tells us: ""These are my memories of Barnaby Downing.""

Tall, elegant, absent - mindedly tidying the room, Quentin shows his hero's an - guish in physical terms chiefly by ending sentences with a self-despising smile. The cor - ners of his stretched mouth turn down; the smile is ironic; the feelings just expressed are not to be believed. The reliance upon Barn - aby 's point of view leaves significant gaps in his biogra - phy , and he does seem to have been oddly short of male confidants. Was Oxford so unhelpful in 195 S? Quentin himself managed to survive. How much of him exists in this portrait is impossible to say, but he draws a sombre portrait of a talent that failed to resist the call to snuff itself out.

"Roberts, Alison",Poets take to the road,The Times,1994-May-03,"London, England","Poets take to the road
This year's literary band - wagon belongs to the poets. The Poetry Soci - ety 's New Generation of 20 scribblers hit the road today on a reading tour which takes in many festival venues, constitut - ing a kind of roving festival itself. Poetry, unlike prose fiction, is perfect literary festival material. Literature is, essentially, a soli - tary art form; neither reading nor writing requires an audi - ence . In fact, the activities can be positively hindered by the presence of a crowd. By and large, novelists, no matter how famous, do not pack a hall by reading aloud from their works. Too often those events turn into glorified sign - in g sessions. It is different with poetry. Poetry sounds better when it is read out loud and a lot of it is designed for performance, which means the poet, unlike the novelist, is part showman and can hold the attention of festival-goers . Poems are self - contained things, usually short.
And if the author is there to read his work, he can explain it too. The New Generation tour takes in more than 20 towns and cities in May alone. Simon Armitage, David Dabydeen and Lavinia Greenlaw are at the Brighton Festival on May 10, for example. Michael Donaghy, Michael Hofmann and Kathleen Jamie visit the Hay Festival on May 22 and the Birmingham Readers and Writ - ers Festival is a stop-off for John Burnside, Glyn Maxwell and Sarah Maguire. The other 11 venues range from Aberdeen to Firle, near Lewes. Other poets who will pop up all over the country this sum - mer include Sir Stephen Spend - er . He will be reading from his new volume Dolphins at sev - eral festivals and takes part in an interesting-sounding 1930s evening at the Brighton Festi - val . A troika of talking heads
A reading tour will crisscross the country. Alison Roberts reports
will dissect the great 1930s poets; Jon Stallworthy will talk on Louis MacNeice, Peter Por - ter on W.H. Auden and Sir Stephen, the last living member of that club, will read his own work. Poetry brings a sense of theatre to the literary festival. How else to enliven an event which can seem too worthy for its own good? The Hay Festival of Litera - ture and the Arts will have an undoubted sense of theatre, though, for its celebration of the written and spoken word will number Barry Humphries among a cast which also in - cludes Vikram Seth, Doris Les - sing and Benjamin Zephaniah.
Humprey Carpenter, biogra - pher and presenter of Radio 3's Nightwaves, takes over as direc - tor of this year's Cheltenham Literary Festival. ""I was con - fronted with a festival that was running extremely well,"" he says. ""But I decided to take a slightly different approach by giving each day a theme."" This structure is designed to encourage creativity by focus - sing thought on a particular subject, not necessarily literary. It also headlines events with more than a reader's name — which is good marketing. So the opening Sunday is designated Booker Prize Day, with prize-winners on hand to talk and read. This is followed.
in chronological order, by Sci - ence Writing Day, Writers and the Mind (timely, with Peter Brooks' adaptation of Oliver Sachs' neurological novel, The Man who Mistook His Wife for a Hat , wowing theatre audi - ences up and down the country). Then Whodunnit Day, ""Old Codgers' Day"" (that's a working title and in no way reflects the status of writers such as Sir Kingsley Amis, who will appear), History Writing Day and State of the Church Day. The curtain will come down on the final Sunday with a ""big drama event — a world pre - miere which is rather unusual"" . Mr Carpenter is keeping its exact nature a secret. ""I have found that writers are excited at the prospect of talking about something other than them - selves and their work. So this themed day idea is a sort of challenge for them.""

from Laura Riding's , as though to prove witch - god - desses and their worshippers still exist. Out of this brew there come some remarkable writings by her: poems which are forbidding yet sometimes hypnotic. They are emana - tions of her character and have something of its power. For a time they influenced, in their moonlike way, Auden's early poetry, as in his beautiful poem beginning ""This lunar beauty/Has no History/Is complete and early... "" Riding seems determined to limit poetry to the expression of ideas wrung out of literal truths of observation of her own thinking. Her poems are never allowed to stray beyond
M ore than any other writer, Laura Rid - ing comes to us packaged with an almost ines - capable personal legend: how in 1929 she leapt out of the fourth floor window of a house in Hammersmith, breaking her spine and nearly killing herself, followed by Robert Graves who, sensibly, ran down two flights of stairs before jumping out of a second floor window to rescue her. How, leaving his then family and her admirers, they went to Majorca to set up house there, she in command and submit - ting Graves and various visit - ing poets to severe criticism of their works and to her domes - tic rule of witch-like terror; and how, in 1939, she went to Florida where she married Schuyler Jackson, a farmer. The legend seems to have acquired a life inseparable
these into any effect that is for the sake of ""the poetry"", in order to be ""poetic"". Each poem seems to be both poem and renunciation of poetry. In the end poetry is rejected for the sake of philosophising'in a prose which sometimes be - comes a kind of abstract poetry. Central to all this is a very consciously controlling sensibility, as though Riding were . an emanation of Graves's White goddess. The collection of her prose writings, edited by Elizabeth Friedman and Alan J. Clark, is a serious and considered dis - cussion of what it signifies to be a woman. It relates how self-admiring , posturing man has always tried to rob woman
THE WORD ""WOMAN "" and other writings By Laura Riding Carcanet, £14.95 A SELECTION OF THE POEMS OF LAURA RIDING Edited by Robert Nye Carcanet, £9.95pbk of her true identity. Instead of seeing her as the reality she is, he sees her as a problem in his own life. Riding draws a thick black line between the sexes. Although she mentions some - where that she is married
reading her book one wonders how she could ever have crossed this line. Although pushed to the point of caricature, her argu - ment is powerful and, I found, often persuasive. It is that Man, the player of roles, invents a role for women — or, rather, for Woman — and refuses to recognise her real nature: ""In relating woman to himself man can only consider the uses of woman: and the standing which he assigns to her derives from the impor - tance that he attaches to her uses. He can only consider the uses of woman because he is motivated only by self-interest : his activities have to do only with himself. Woman is moti -
vated by necessity — the necessity to maintain unity. She has no design to use man; he is something that happens."" A weakness of the book is that it is all generalisation. True, there is one chapter in which Riding discusses an - swers to a questionnaire she has sent out: but all the questions are addressed to women, there are none to men, and she deals with the an - swers rather briskly. Her ar - gument is weakened by the impression she gives of either patronising or detesting other women. Most of all, she de - tests Virginia Woolf. The male reader feels him - self gradually battered into
assent at all these"" assaults. This is largely because, while discussing qualities which are indeed perhaps common to all, or most men, and while quot - ing statements made by indi - viduals , she does not examine in any depth examples of individual men, the qualities shown in their works and achievements: Shakespeare or Jesus Christ, for example. Nevertheless this book does cover very wide areas of history, literature, work and behaviour. It examines the situation of women under what in all fields, including language, man predominates over women — an injustice which is embedded even with - in grammar, our use of words, indeed in words themselves. What is lacking is the slightest trace of any sense of humour. It leaves one longing for a female Voltaire.

"May, Derwent",Battle of the slim volumes,The Times,1994-Apr-28,"London, England","Battle of the slim volumes
P oetry is selling again, so the publishers say — and this spring two ma - jor publishers are each putting their money where their mouth is by launching a new poetry series in good-looking paperback format. The books on the new Sinclair-Stevenson list cost £6.99 each, and are headed by James Michie's Collected Poems. Michie, now in his mid-sixties , has been publish - ing poems sparingly all his life. He is an epigrammatic rather than a mellifluous poet, but almost every one of these slowly-gathered pieces has a firm kernel of wit or complex feeling. In one typical poem,
he sits on the river-bank fishing, using satire as his fishing-rod — but what he hauls in is ""an ancient horrify - ing conger"", which is ""the long lie of his education"". Satire cannot deal with this monster — the fishing-line breaks and the ugly brute goes back into the river, once more free. He also includes some wry, tender love poems, never expecting too much from the girl (or from himself), but always grateful. Anthony Thwaite's The Dust of the World and Alan Brownjohn's In The Cruel Arcade are both collections by poets long practised at writing a shapely verse. Thwaite now -
adays looks mostly for public occasions, like the death of other poets, or for incidents abroad. He often builds up unemphatic details till feeling breaks out in a plangent final line: like the last words of the poet George MacBeth, ""How long will I sleep?"" Brownjohn is more introspective. "" Mov - ing from hope to hope like stepping stones"" one of his poems begins, and many of these poems are about uneasy hopes. He, too, commemo - rates MacBeth's recent death — by desperately visiting a young prostitute to assuage his grief. Afterwards, he is sure (or is it too sure?) that MacBeth's photograph smiles understanding^ at him. The youngest of Sinclair - S tevenson 's poets is Marryn Crucefix, whose collection is called On Whistler Moun - tain . As with films nowadays, you do not know what his poems are about till you are some way into them, but that is clearly what he intends. He likes to create an energetic criss-crossing of moods and
words belonging to different people at different times, until a picture gradually emerges, as in the long poem ""At The Mountjoy Hotel"", about a restless barfly watching a wedding reception on a Satur - day afternoon. There is real if disorderly vitality here, and some sharp, often comic obser - vation in the shorter poems. Also in the Sinclair-Stevenson list: Selected Poems by Jon Silkin and This Time of Year by Ruth Fainlight. The poets in the new Jonathan Cape list are wilder and cost a penny more (the books are £7 each). Peter Redgrove has been com - posing gleeful fantasies for years and his new collection My Father's Trapdoors is in the same unmistakable vein. He imagines a man serving his woman all-black meals (coffee , molasses) in the day - time and all-white meals (""boiled fish and spumanti"" ) at night — until she turns the tables by making scarlet curry and ""lung-pink cakes"". All
quite teasingly sexy and funny — but such fantasy tires rather quickly. Eleanor Cooke's fantasies in Secret Files are about the Virgin Mary. She offers a half - bawdy , half-mystical rewrit - ing of the story of Christ and his mother, which brings in two Marys that have hitherto been mixed up. The bizarre incidents and paradoxical metaphors occasionally stab one into response but more often they seem to leave the sphere of intelligibility. John Burnside in The Myth of the Twin records numerous intuitions of a spiritual world lurking within the everyday —
like ""the whisper of the wind on frosted glass"" or ""the crown of thorns in a woodpigeon's nest"". In other poems, the absence of that world becomes even more haunting. The main weakness in the work of all these last three poets is their lack of any compelling rhythm — or in - deed of any attempt to create one . Too many of their poems move like a dog with a paralysed leg — heave, col - lapse , heave, collapse, from one line to the next. Other books in the Cape series: Turner by David Dabydeen and The Handless Maiden by Vicki Feaver.

A famous left - wing dramatic genius and master of the significant pause (can't think who this is) conde - scends to chat with a nervous admirer. ""I enjoyed your Big - ots Against Poetry,"" gushes the fan. There is a significant pause, while the playwright draws a warning breath and his eyes go yellow like a dog's. Unhappily for the victim — whose sudden, flailing, verbal laceration recalls Janet Leigh's unpleasant surprise in Psycho — the book was entitled Poets Against Bigotry. This mix-up comes to mind because, while Ted Wallace, the coruscating minor-poet narrator of Stephen Fry's sec - ond comic novel The Hi ppo - p otamus , slides comfortably into that revolting World of Leather of sexist old snobs and whisky-drenched cantanker - ous bullies who constitute the older generation of our Eng - lish belle-lettrists , it is some - times hard to work out where he stands on this important bigotry-poetry thing, mainly because he is a vain nasty poet

On the sexual front, he ogles women whose ""breasts stand up like begging dogs""; on the stylistic, he is committed to the resuscitation and vigorous exercise of underused English words such as ""gibbous"", ""beazel "" and ""footling"" . Memorably, he describes his body in motion as resembling ""a bin - liner full of yoghurt"". Proceeding by means of first and third-person narration,

letters and diaries, the plot is pretty slim, but the tireless inventiveness of the writing more than compensates. Wal - lace meets his god-daughter at a Soho club called Harpo's (cant think what this is). She asks him to cadge an invita - tion to Swafford, the Suffolk country home of her rich uncle, where something mys - terious is going on, concerning miraculous recoveries, resur - rections and a teenage boy. Wallace is enticed by the large sum of money she offers, and agrees. ""A quarter of a mil - lion ?"" he repeats. ""This isn't lire, is it?"" At Swafford, we notably meet David, the precocious testosterone-crazed teenager (fotherington-tomas crossed with the boy in Equus), Da - vid 's prosaic older brother Simon (for whom poetry was ""a closed book in a locked cupboard in a high attic in a
lonely house in a remote hamlet in a distant land"" ), and a few other grown-ups , whose main narrative function is to react to Wallace and be foils for his excellent jokes. In the end, Wallace solves the mys - tery by revealing that it is not a mystery at all. How his bigot - ry or poetry helps him to this opinion is unfortunately unclear. As a crafter of aphorisms, Fry improves on The Liar's Wildean fireworks, finding slightly deeper, more cynical truths. Wallace observes that his god-daughter is not so pretty in the taxi — ""but then no one ever is, which is why it's always worth having shares in whisky and cosmet - ics "". Aside from a tiresome gay house-guest at Swafford, who refers laboriously to Tessa Tedium, Hetty the Hosepipe Ban and Clara Cloud, the jokes are all bang on. ""David thought my poem 'Lines on the Face of W. H. Auden' was contrived,"" re - ports Wallace wearily. ""Which I told him was like complain - ing that 101 Dalmatians had a lot of dogs in it.""

Britain's poets are swarming out of their ghetto, loud and proud
The eruption of poetry — on the radio , in the newspapers, in local pubs — points to an important cultural shift: poetry is coming out of its ghetto. Publishers have begun to take poetry seriously again. For the first time in 20 years, for example, a major publish - i n g house is launching a new poetry list. Cape has signed David Dabydeen , Viki Feaver and John Burnside — all of whom will bring out new, very different , collections in April. Just as significant is the news from Penguin, which publishes volumes by Frank O'Hara and John Ashbury at the end of the month. Its Modern Poets list is being resurrected after a 20-year lapse. The 150-page books, containing selected work'by three poets, brought us the Beat and Liverpool poets, but the list stopped when those scenes petered out. We can expect the first three new volumes , two of them headed by James Fenton and Carol
Ann Duffy, next spring. The phenomenon is not merely London-based : a com - prehensive anthology of Scot - tish poetry comes out in April from Edinburgh University Press , coinciding with a new collection of young Scots work, Dream State (Polygbn). The sixth edition of Francis Turner Palgrave 's Golden Treasury (Oxford University Press) is out in July, and includes verse by established contemporary names — Seamus Heaney and Tony Harrison , for example. Then there are 20 young poets, the Poetry Society 's ""New Genera - tion "", touring the country like rock stars. ""The work is various, origi - nal , energetic and not homoge - neous . There is much greater freedom and excitement,"" says Robin Robertson, senior editor at Cape. ""This is the point where we should take a snap - shot of poetry ."" Robert Crawford, one of the New Generation poets and poetry editor at Polygon in Edinburgh , thinks that poetry
has been energised by a differ - e n t kind of readership and writership, whose roots lie in a ""postwar extension of the edu - cational franchise"". ""The 1930s scene existed around Oxbridge and London, and that set a pattern for various groupings around the country later. Now there are so many different kinds of poetry — much of it very good. ""We are living in a time when ideas of plurality are fashionable — that allows poets, who deal in different languages, to be more com - fortable and experimental."" Feminist poetry, black poet - r y and Liverpool poetry once existed in separate boxes. Mix - and - match is now the word. P oetry is also speaking more directly about peo - ple 's lives, according to the new director of the Poetry Society, Chris Mead. Again, this reflects poetry's broader base.
""People are hungry for something which articulates their feelings about the world around them and their place in it. I think the New Genera - tion of poets are satisfying that need,"" he says. Ultimately , Mead wants po - etry to be part of the national popular literary scene. He wants poetry to be just as important to our perception of culture as the novel. Many readers buy the Booker novel because they feel they ought to, but how many go out of their way to find , say, the Forward Poetry Prize winner? At present, statistics from Book Marketing show that poetry 'constituency is still very small. Although James Fenton has sold more than 6,000 copies of his most recent volume, published in Septem - ber , many of the top 20 poets are lucky to sell a couple of thousand. The poets reckon that per - ception of a cultural shift takes some time to filter through. When it does, they are pre - pa red for the deluge. .

Too little pity in the poetry
Kiri and Carreras may fill the Albert Hall, but the audi - ence for a War Requiem tends to be small and som - bre — an assembly of the devoted, eager to accept a Peace Pledge Union hand - bill or two on the way in. Any performance of Britten's masterwork, writ - ten for the restored Coven - try Cathedral 20 years after the war which had devastat - ed it, is always aware of the abiding sense of occasion and the expectations the work still sets up. Stephen Cleobury's , on Sunday, marking the 150th anniver - sary of the Cambridge University Musical Society (whose orchestra and chorus were joined by the
Bach Choir and the choris - ters of Ely Cathedral), was no exception . Every second was meticu - lously planned: the placing of the boys, invisibly, in a high, side gallery; the posi - tioning of the soprano solo - ist in the organ loft; the calculation of the precise length of every resonating choral consonant; the bal - ance of every shifting or - chestral texture. With the soloists, too, nothing was left to chance. Deborah Riedel sang true and clear, Michael George's baritone was as dark and steady as the ""long black arm"" of the great gun cursed by Wilfred Owen's words and Britten's setting of them. Martyn Hill's

Albert Hall faultless control and minute shaping of ""One ever hangs where shelled roads part"" epitomised the beauty of vocal placing and enuncia - tion in his performance. All this care and intelli - gence , though, rarely led the listener beyond the remark - ing of it. The score is prefaced by Owen's own words on ""War , and pity of War"". They have, perhaps, been quoted once too often; but ""The poetry is in the pity"" and any performance which fails to re-create in the listener more than a cerebral acknowledgement of this pity and this terror
has fallen short. This performance was strongest on the cold anger and irony which patters and stutters out of the mock militarism of so much of Britten's writing. But when it came to the subtle modu - lation of tone of voice at ""each slow dusk"" , when it came to the engagement of the very core of the singer with the despair within Owen's repeated questions, and when suppliance and a sense of time and silence were also needed, this per - formance lost its nerve. Nothing less than ""titanic tears"" are required from this music, these words.

Criticism may be damning, but only in cases where some reputation is completely bogus (as with Ella Wheeler Wilcox). This book is not an arena for carrying on feuds between poets, and there are limits here to the outspoken: though fun is provided by some critics slipping in some snide remarks about their colleagues, especially the Americans. Thus in a thoughtful appraisal of John Berryman,
In this collection of assessments of 20th-century poets writing in Eng - lish Ian Hamilton, the editor, suc - ceeds , on the whole triumphantly, in his declared aim of providing a map of modern poetry in English. He qualifies this by adding: ""I want it to be seen as serious and useful, but I will not mind if it is read for fun, as a kind of documentary entertainment."" The book is produced in the style of earlier Oxford Companions to various literatures. The great difference is that the style and manner of previous volumes — despite acknowledgement to various ""con - tributors "" — is anonymous, whereas the contributions by various authors to the present volume are initialled, and the names corresponding to the initials easily discoverable from an introductory ""key "". Inevitably most of the contributions are short paragraphs rather than essays. But there are many longer ones, some of them running to three or four double-column pages. The sum of these essays adds up to an anthology of informed current critical opinion about modern poetry. This is as revealing of 20th-century poetics as much of the poetry discussed. Hamilton keeps his contributors on a loose rein, but all respond to certain editorial obligations laid on them: that they provide essential biographical mate -
it is to be alive) certain characteristics of a manifesto: something of which Hamilton is aware when in his introduction he relates ""English"" to ""American"" poetry, referring to arguments of A. Alvarez in his anthology The New Poetry and Helen Vendler's introduction to her anthology Modern American Verse. Considered as a
manifesto, this Oxford Companion makes Au - den the most important poet of the 20th century, an eminence established by his five pages, as against three and a half each to Eliot and to Yeats, three each to Rob - ert Frost, Elizabeth Bishop and Robert Low - ell , two and a half to PhiKp Larkin, two each to Ezra Pound and Wil - liam Carlos Williams. The essay on Auden by Nicholas Jenkins is perhaps the most bril -
liantly informative in a collection which contains many excellent essays: among others, Seamus Heaney on Robert Lowell, Carel Rumens on Wallace Stevens, Wil - liam Pritchard on Robert Frost, Blake Morrison on Philip Larkin, John Haffenden on William Empson, Amit Chaudhuri on D.H. Lawrence — to
mention only a few which particularly struck me. This volume serves a very good purpose in bringing poets like Dom Moraes from India, Chinua Achebe, Wole Soyinka from Nigeria, and other writers in English scattered through the world into the community of modern English poetry. I suppose a book of this kind is bound to have a few let-downs . But the essay here on T.S. Eliot by Hugh Haughton seems worse than a let-down , a gigantic blot. It is written throughout in the kind of encyclo - pedese packaged gobbledegook which other writers here so successfully avoid. Haughton awards The Waste Land the following summation: ""With its hallu - cinatory iconography of post-war London and stammering vision of psychic disinte - gration , it is one of the inescapable landmarks of 20th-century poetry. Much of Eliot's later career can be understood as an attempt to escape its consequences."" Eliot is treated throughout as a cunning manipulator of his own reputation. ""His Collected Poems"" we are told, ""embodies
one of the most complete and cunningly contrived oeuvres in 20th-century litera - ture ."" And in conclusion: ""Eliot 's reaction - ary politics, religious orthodoxy, cultural elitism, and mandarin temperament have done much to render his work suspect to later readers on both sides of the Atlantic."" The phrase ""cultural elitist"" here seems to give the game away. At this point Political Correctness seems to have sneaked into this volume. The Liverpool poets are put down here, by Martin Seymour-Smith . Given the vociferous ""poetry revival"" which provides back - ground music as I write these lines, an anthology of 20th-century poetry edited in the year 2000 will look very different from the present one. But probably it is in the Nineties that a century looks back on its own ripeness. This volume traces the modernism of Pound and Eliot, rooted in what they regarded as the tradition, the re-creation in old age of his individualistic Irish self by Yeats, and the exploitation of these by Auden who, with his irrepress - ible spontaneity, refused to be restrained by the pedantries of modernism.

M ost of us old fogies have loved Kipling's poetry (or verse, as he modestly preferred to call it) all our lives. We are comfort - able with it, finding in it few problems, little to question and explain. We are thus baffled by what each new generation appar - ently has to do to rediscover and justify him, to render him acceptable and find him good or great. With some apprehen - sion we see young intellectuals and critics, dons and poets rushing forward to defend him against attacks we never launched or perhaps even noticed; to acquit him of holding obnoxious views which we dont find obnoxious at all; to exonerate him from crimes which we thought no crimes or of which we deemed him innocent anyway; to make Kipling's military moustache and stiff collar (see book jacket ) dear to all those with torn jeans and wild beards. Some of Kipling's new de - fenders seem indeed upon acquaintance most congenial.
Kipling needs no apology or plea of mitigation from later generations, says Colin Welch
Peter Keating for instance (no beard) is, with slight reserva - tions , most welcome. Few indeed can be those Kipling buffs who derive no profit, no new insights from his careful and balanced study of the poetry, enthusiastic, imaginative and sensible as it is. For instance, Kipling is of - ten damned for writing too much public poetry instead of the introspective murmurings now widely favoured. Keating deals crisply with this. He points out that much of Kip - ling 's innermost thought and feeling was about public af - fairs , that his prophetic public warnings (many uncannily ac - curate ) and sombre admoni - tions come right from the heart. Orwell, I think it was, described him as the most ""responsible"" of our poets. His heavy sense of public responsi - bility was not just a check, a brake on his genius, but its vital inspiration.
E minent indeed have been some of Kipling 's unexpected champions. T.S. Eliot felt impelled on ev - ery opportunity to testify for Kipling. Nobly he did so in his 1941 introduction to his Choice of Kipling's Verse. This sensa - tional publishing event in itself cast doubt on Kipling's neglect by and estrangement from the literary establish - ment , though he hated some of its members and many of them hated him. No compara - ble writers came in 1936, alas, to see him interred in Poet's Corner. Auden too, denounced by Orwell as a sort of gutless The review of Gemma Hussey's Ireland Today (Jan - uary 13) stated wrongly that contraception is available only on prescription there.
Kipling, nonetheless turned out in safe New York in 1943 to praise Kipling's verse and Eliot's Choice. Earlier Auden, quoted by Keating, had said ""You were silly like us: Your gift survived it all."" Auden was actually addressing Yeats at that point but, according to Keating, addressing himself and Kipling too. Time, Auden continued, has ""pardoned Kip - ling and his views"". This unctuous absolution Kipling could perhaps have done with - out . His views were to him important and right. He can - not have thought them as silly as some of Auden's, nor in need of any pardon from time, Auden or anyone else. Incidentally, such critical praise as Kipling has got does concentrate disproportionate - ly on his late, ""difficult"" and ""modern"" stories. Critics un - derstandably favour work which is complex , ambiguous and in need of an explanatory gloss. Like roughage, It gives them something to chew on, a role and purpose; hence to - day 's much admired obscurity.
K eating is generally and admirably elucidatory about Kipling. Just occasionally he slips, like Au - den , into officious pardons, otiose apologies and pleas of mitigation for what are not obviously crimes, lapses or ""sillinesses"". For instance, Keating picks out ""The White Man's Bur - den "" as ""what would come to be regarded as Kipling's most infamous poem"". Does Keat - ing himself regard it as "" infa - mous "" ? He does not say so, but does, not explicitly disagree either,Admittedly, if he did, he might be .challenged to name at'leasf one poem even more ""infamous "", which might ex - pose him to other charges of squeamish over - censorious - ness . But he does not. ""There can be no doubt"", Keating goes on, ""that the poem is profoundly racist in sentiment"". No doubt? The poem is imperialist no doubt, but racist? We should always remember about Kipling, what Keating elsewhere honourably emphasises, that ""The White Man"" he
addressed and honoured is not just a man who is white. Boers and Germans might be white in colour, but were not white within the moral meaning of Kip - ling 's Act. They did not in his view stand for that freedom and equal justice that he regarded as essential, were not thus in consequence fit to carry the White Man's Burden. They were ""lesser breeds without the Law"". This ""Law "" they had rejected, thus putting themselves below the coloured ""lesser breeds"" who had never known it. The Boer in particu - lar treated the ""kaffir"" too badly to be a White Man in Kipling's moral sense. If the The White Man's
Burden were in fact "" pro - foundly racist"", it could not but bring racism into good repute. The White Man is adjured selflessly to serve his captives' needs, to be patient, to suppress his own pride, to ""fill full the mouth of Famine and bid the sickness cease"". KIPLING The Poet By Peter Keating Seeker & Warburg, £25 What is wrong or ""infamous "" about this? The White Man brought some peace and pros - perity to Africa. He is gone, or going. Charity workers try nobly, if in vain, to replace him, to alleviate the ensuing chaos. Are they too all ""pro - found ly racist"" ? About other allegedly racist outbursts of Kipling's Keating is admirably calm and just. He reminds us that the ballad which begins ""Oh , East is East and West is West"" continues with a resounding assertion that ""when two strong men
stand face to face"", matters of race, religion, birth and social status are irrelevant. Keating is uneasy about ""the two strong men"" — a concept open to further objections, ""but racism is not one of them"". Might not Keating have been wiser to admit at once that Kipling was indeed a racist, as now defined, if of a benign sort? So were most of his contemporaries who had shared his experi - ence and insights, as are perhaps all now who can tell the difference between 1 one race and another. Hit - ler 's racism fathered gas chambers. Kipling's by con - trast fathered a lofty and dutiful paternalism. Certainly Kipling's racism could justify to him no crime or ""necessary killing"" — Auden's chilling and irresponsible phrase. Wis - er not to deny Kipling's racism but rather to study it impar - tially , sine ira. Two questions arise at once: was Kipling foolish or evil to be a racist? In Kipling's racism what is wise and good? Other potential infamies arise from Kipling's supposed
misogyny and his slipping easily in correspondence ""into the casual language of anti - Semitism "". With these Keating deals fairly and briefly. Kipling's misogyny was common enough in the British India of his day, where the arrival of the memsahib had disastrous social consequen - ces . Her racism was perhaps not as benign as his own. The Jews he suspected of being in league first with the Kaiser, then with the Bolshe - viks : too many were, for reasons which non-Jews famil - iar with imperial Russian history ruefully understand. Rightly or wrongly, Jews of Kipling's day regarded both the Kaiser and the Bolsheviks as preferable to the Tsars — none of them perhaps White Men to Kipling. Kipling's ""racist"" hatred of Germany together with Hit - ler 's persecution of the Jews (if Kipling knew much of it, he died in January 1936) should have cleared his mind. Inci - dentally , he quickly de - nounced the Protocols of the Elders of Zion as ""clearly fakes"". A good start?

"Nye, Robert",In a minor key,The Times,1994-Jan-06,"London, England","In a minor key
ELAINE Feinstein's translations of Marina Tsvetaeva are justly famous. First published 22 years ago, they have established Tsvetaeva (1892-1941 ) in the minds of English-speaking readers as one of the great Russian poets of the 20th century. Robert Frost once said that poetry is what gets lost in translation, but here is the exception which proves the rule. Tsvetaeva's Selected Poems, in the Feinstein versions, have now made it to the ranks of the Oxford Poets, and the result is a book which can be read with pleasure as English verse (OUP, £9.99 pbk). Over the years the transla - tor has added to her original selection, and there are ten new lyrics in the present volume, as well as an updated introduction and notes. Tsvetaeva emerges from these pages as a nail-biting poet whose spirit dressed itself in images of curious sensuality — curious because it seems to be a sensuality that wants to deny the body, extolling the handclasp without hands and the kiss without lips. At all points I was reminded of a marvellous sen - tence which I came across in a letter she wrote to Ril -
ke : ""I do not live in my lips, and he who kisses me misses me."" That is the heart of Marina Tsvetaeva, and Fein - stein (who has also written her biography ) comes close to it. Tsvetaeva killed her - self . Federico Garcia Lorca , Spain's greatest
modern poet, was mur - dered by Nationalist partisans in 1936, shortly after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. But all should know that I have not died... Lorca's own words have proved splendidly true, and his fame has spread like wildfire from that day. Yet in the confu - sion of the Civil War the manu - script of his last poems, his tormented ""Sonnets of Dark Love"", disappeared from sight, and for 50 years the poems lived only in the memory of those who had heard him read them aloud. Recently rediscovered, these son - nets have now been published in Spain, and Merryn Williams is the first to translate them into English in her Federico Garda Lorca: Selected Poems (Blood - axe Books, £7.95). Brooding and
magnificent, they show that Lor - ca was struck down in his prime. This book draws on the com - plete range of Lorca's verse, from the early gypsy ballads to the alienated ""Poet in New York"" sequence. These are poems of blood and moon and knives and snow, the heart-breaking songs of a wounded nightingale. Lorca was never quite the artless singer he pretended to be, but the best of his work has the drive and the dance of folk-poetry . The duende, he called it, that mysterious power in flamenco which sweeps performers and then audiences off their feet. Williams throws in a transla - tion of the full text of Lorca's lecture on the duende, for good measure. It is an important addition, and indicative of the understanding which she brings
r-stmmWk to him. ""I have stuck fairly closely to Lorca's meaning,"" she de - clares , ""while trying to produce poems which are acceptable in their own right."" At her finest, as in the version of the ""Lament for Ignacio Sanchez Mejias"", Lorca's elegy for his bullfighter friend, Williams seems to me as musical a translator of this material as Roy Campbell, and without doubt more accurate. Tsvetaeva and Lorca lived in backward times before poets were punished for their poems by the award of giant cash prizes. The contributors to The Forward Book of Poetry 1994 (Sinclair - Stevenson , £5.95 pbk) have not been so lucky. Here are the winning entries to the Forward Poetry Prizes, 90-odd poems judged to be ""the best of new contemporary poetry"" by Cres - sida Connolly, Douglas Dunn, Liz Lochhead, Blake Morrison and Margaret Drabble. Top prizes go to Carol Ann Duffy (best collection); Don Patersqn (best first collection); and Vicki Feaver
(smgle poem). I could not be so cruel as to say that these poets de - serve it. Carol Ann Duffy, in particular, seems an authentic poet, writing out of concerns that have nothing to do with the winning of prizes, and Don Paterson's Nil ND (Faber, £5.99 pbk) is at the least an interesting
first book, full of things which suggest its author could be any - thing . The trouble, of course, is that the limelight is not the best place for anyone's anything to develop into their own special something. It will be said that poets have to survive somehow in a world where poetry does not pay. This is true, but the point is that a new peril enters the picture precisely when poetry does pay. Besides, some poets have solved the sur - vival problem by writing prose as it were with their other hand, something that can be done without any undue loss of poetic virtue . Alan Sillitoe is well-known as a novelist and story-writer ; his Collected Poems (HarperCollins,
£14.99) is a decent assemblage of more man 30 years' work. Sillitoe says in his preface that ""a poet who presents his collected poems displays the emotional history of <. his heart and soul"", contrasting this with the activity of a novelist i ""who may hide behind his fiction for the whole of his writing life"". It is an interesting distinction, and a revealing one in theory, but I think in practice that Sillitoe has put more of his heart and soul into his stories than into his verse, simply because those stories have come to him more naturally, or read that way. The best of his poems, though, puzzle out per^ sonal meaning from passionate feelings which he seeks to make intelligible to others, and that is always welcome.

"Johnson, Daniel",Poems by the glass,The Times,1993-Nov-25,"London, England","Harry Fainlight, Rilke, women poets and a verse review of the new Fenton
iythe glass
Rilke has a superb image somewhere of the poet being ""a ringing glass that shat - ters as it rings"". I always think of that when I think of Harry Fairilight. Found dead of bronchial pneumonia outside the remote Welsh cottage where he had made a home for himself alone . The 47 years of Fainlight's life must have looked like total failure to most who met him during the course of it. Frail, fervent, dedicated to poetry in a way that put most of his contemporaries to shame, I must say that he struck me differently. I did not know him well but I admired his work and once tried to get a volume of it into print. This venture ended in disaster with Fainlight threatening to shoot the publisher if he went ahead. Being unpublished was of some impor - tance to him. One of his lyrics
begins ""Sing on, unpublished one, O unpolluted throat."" He died 11 years ago, and despite subsequent praise from Ted Hughes and Allen Ginsberg is still not as well known as he deserves. Perhaps Journeys (Turret Books, £12) will do the trick. This is a tall, elegant , slim volume , 17 fine poems beautifully printed, with a frontis - p iece by Mary Moore and an introduction by Sir Stephen Spend - er which ends with the words, ""Harry Fainlight and his poetry should be famous"". Of course, what is really needed to achieve that is a fat collected edition, from one of the big publishing houses. But then nothing about Fainlight was ever fat. His work seems fragmentary almost by definition, since percep - tions of this intensity cannot be long drawn out:
O pavement comfortable to sink down onto as God, why could not I sink? Some - thing stupider even than the weight of my own body still holding me up, impossible to be broken. He is talking about his own poetic vocation, which the world did fail to break. Ringing glasses, as Rilke knew, are shattered by a purer music altogether. You can catch unmistakable sounds of that music in the work of Harry Fairilight, and while it is still ringing in a book published in an edition, limited to 500 copies you can at least regard it as your own discovery. The ringing glass that was Rilke himself can be heard in M.D. Herter Norton's new paperback Translations From The Poetry Of Rainer Maria Rilke and the same author's version of Letters to a Young Poet (Norton, £6.95 each). Norton's translations of the poems are admirably literal, and they manage to suggest the feel of Rilke's thought, the winding verse - sentences , the way his poems move in a logic that is quite other than the
logic of prose. The German is printed on the opposite page to each translation, and the selection is fully representative of Rilke's work up to the long period of silence that fell after publication of the Marienleben in 1913. As for the Letters , they still read with remarkable freshness, and I cannot think of a better book to put into the hands of any young would - be poet, as an inspirational guide to poetry and to surviving as a poet in a hostile world. The English poet Edward Lowbury will have survived for 80 years next month, and it is good to see his life's work honoured with both a Collected Poems (Hippo - potamus Press, £14.95) and a festschrift in celebration of his achievement called Physic Meet and Metaphysic, edited by Yann Lovelock (Hippopotamus Press, £12.95). Lowbury has had a long and distinguished career as a microbi - ologist as well as a poet. His verse is invariably well-made , lucid, and modest in scope, but at his best, as in ""The Collector"", he manages to turn these Georgian virtues into

something more interesting than anything the actual Georgians wrote. That poem finds a metaphor for his view of life inflowers , telling how as a boy he wanted to pick every bluebell in the wood, learning later the advantage of only picking one flower of every kind, and thence to confining himself purely to the names of flowers. The last stanza is irreproachable: A lifetime brought this new . collector 's itch: In a world of flowers, names, necessities — To see how many I could do without:
And at last the distant shout ""Come home"" finds me exult - ing in a wealth Of unpossessions — all of it, perhaps, A practice-run for doing with - out myself Lowbury's is a quiet voice, but it might still be heard when many noisier ones have been forgotten. It is the quiet voices that sound clearest in Sixty Woman Poets, Linda France's fascinating anthology of the work of 20th - century British and Irish female poets since 1971 (Bloodaxe, £8.95 pbk original). The older generation, re present - ed by Ruth Pitter and E.J. Scovell, makes its presence felt tellingly, as
do some of the younger ones such as. Carol Ann Duffy and Medbh McGuckian. The book's star, though, is Jenny Joseph, born in 1932. Her lyrical-satirical medita - tions , not well-served by short quotation, best encapsulate that wild quality, ""the sense of a creature constrained too long"", which France suggests as charac - teristic of the book as a whole. There are more (and more interest - ing ) women poets now active than at any previous period in literary history, and this book testifies eloquently to that fact. - In Book of Matches (Faber, £5.99 pbk original), Simon Armitage is the poet as the Boy Next Door, writing plain sturdy stuff about his own life, as com - pared with the lives of others: At twenty-eight I'm not doing great , but considering I came from the River Colne and its long, lifeless mud, I'm doing good.
Elsewhere, in the sequence about his marriage called ""Reading the Banns,"" there is a better sense of real blood flowing through the veins of memory, but this lad has a long. way to go before anyone mistakes him for a ringing glass. Robert Nye

He is often at his best in light scherzando passagework, where his p lay - ing has a crystalline clarity and attractively sweet tone quality. Not only does he get his fingers impressively round the notes at such moments, but he manages to shape them
into the kind of phrases that reveal them to be more than mere bravura. One or two phrases in the Adagio were also turned in a way that promised something special, but it never material - ised . Neither Castro nor. his young accompanist, the up - and - coming Italian conductor Paolo Olmi, was inclined to wallow in the concerto's ex - travagant sentiments, and it was not until the Big Tune in the finale that Castro really drew on expressive rubato to stamp some individuality on the performance.

Passable poetry, dubious drama JL•/ DONALDCOOI
TheCenci Lyric Studio, Hammersmith SHELLEY'S tragedy declares i :s anti - authoritarian stance from the opening line, in which a cardinal tells the wicked Count Cend, ""That matter of the murder is hushed up."" This will not be a play where the poor and dispossessed will find their I cause espoused by the great. Quite the reverse.. | Pope Clement is content that Cenci should go on sinning so that ihe can demand chunks of the sinner's land as marks of contrition. Later, he opposes Cenci's enemies because they are members of a younger generation — in fact, the Count's children — and the primacy of the father must be maintained. The play received no public perfor - mance in England until Sybil Thorn - dike played Beatrice, the Count's valiant daughter, in a production to mark the centenary of Shelley's death.
Now, to mark the bicentenary of his birth, Louise Bangay and Sydnee Blake have formed Damned Poets Theatre Company in order to mount this production. There have been others in between these two, but not many . ""Pure poetry but poor drama,"" is what the Oxford Companion to the Theatre thinks of the work, and whatever ""pure poetry"" means, it certainly does not sound the right material for creating living flesh. The language is blank verse, might - ily influenced by Shakespearean trage - dy , and Shelley manages to make it move the story along, though he loses his way whenever the characters debate with themselves the ethics of killing a bad father. Just because the Count is laying hands upon his daughter, does this permit parricide? Presumably the Count is doing murki - er deeds to her, though she cannot bring herself to name them. ""There are deeds that have no form,"" she hints darkly, and incorrectly. Pure or not, the poetry is undistin -
guished , though if the play happened to be better known, I dare say lines would be quoted for the pregnancy of their simple phrasing. ""I have met with much injustice in the world,"" is one such , though Bangay, playing Bea - trice , makes nothing of it. The best lines in the entire evening come right at the end, ""Here , Mother, tie / My girdle for me, and bind up this hair / In any simple knot; Ay, that does well."" The language is exquisitely ordinary, and the ""any"" is perfection. This cannot be said of Blake's production. Shelley leaves characters
hanging around with nothing to say but Blake gives them nothing interest - ing to do. Setting the play in the 1930s brings no advantage, though it allows Craig Pinder's Count to look like two of the great egotists of the period, Musso - lini and Charles Foster Kane. His lips curl, he all but licks them with his flickering tongue. Relishing his villainy, Pinder grins and snarls, where a more interesting reading might have come from playing against obvious relish; but he is not dull. Sadly, Bangay often is. Drooping shoulders do not make heroines, nor
do arms that are kept dangling . Recordings of Dame Sybil playing Saint Joan make one thankful not to have seen her performance, but that tremulous voice as Beatrice would have suggested that she felt, however quaintly, what she was saying. I did not find that Bangay did suggest this, and the s'elf-righteous hauteur in court and prison requires every fibre of an actress's vocal chords to keep us on her side. I began wishing the Count would come back as a malicious ghost , and this is not the reaction Shelley intended.

V erse is for healthy arty farties. The dying and surgeons use prose. Never mind surgeons, but some - one should tell Peter Reading about Rilke's own epitaph for himself, fine lines written right at the end of a long wasting illness, endured without pain-kilters . Read - ing 's street-wise anti-poetics can be taken as typical of the spirit and tone and taste of much of the work collected in The New Poetry. Ambitiously appropriating a de - finitive title made famous by Alva rez some 30 years ago, here is an anthology which sets out to repre - sent that bright generation of poets which came to maturity in the Eighties , and which still flourishes, more or less. Fifty-five writers are included, English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish, along with others who are British citizens though born elsewhere. The result is a volume which its editors announce in their introduction to be ""fresh"" in its attitudes, risk-taking in ite address, and plural in its forms and voices. The editors claim too much. Ranging from the 52-year-old Pauline Stainer to the 30-year-old Simon Armitage, this is in fact the usual hotch-potch of poetry and fashion, the real and the fake, the felt and the worked-up . The fash - ionable , trie ephemeral 'and the fake are outweighed by the good — in which latter category I would certainly place the poems by Eavan Boland, Peter Didsbury, George Szirtes, Glyn Maxwell, and a promising newcomer Maggie Hannan who has not yet published a book of her own. The book's star poet, though, is for my money the 3 8-year-old Carol Ann Duffy, who contributes six pieces in a variety of modes. Duffy is excellent at the sort of small dramatic monologue which has its speaker reveal himself unwittingly while finding unexpected poetry in turns of modern speech, as when in ""Psychopath"" she has the man
declare: / thought I was on, no error. But her outstanding achieve ment is her love poetry, and the one specimen of this included here, ""Warming Here Pearls"", rises to an intensity which reminds me of Sappho: And I lie here awake/ knowing the pearls are cooling even now/ in the room where my mistress sleeps . All night /I feel their absence and I burn. The editors also claim too little. They do Duffy scant justice, for instance, by remarking that she has been ""exemplary in re-energising a

Beginning with the. proclamation that ""every age gets the literature it deserves"", they seem bent on pur - suit of a political point that would make poetry the mere mirror of the times. Presumably it is this which permits them to omit several inter - estin g poets who cannot be made to fit in with their theories: Sean Haldane, Robert Wells, Anthony Howell, Hugo Williams, Medbh McGuckian. Still, I would not quarrel with anyone who said that 55 poets in one generation was already far too many. Swift de - clared that Britain was never able to boast more than three poets at a time: Our chilling climate hardly bears/A sprig of bays in fifty years That is not the kind of opinion that can be favoured by anthologists
promoting contemporary writing, of course. The editors have done their best to be fair, and they are not the first to have rounded up a lot of geese and called them swans. The New Poetry is more a record of changes in the verse trade than anything else, yet others than the tradesmen will find value in it. The May Anthology comes w i n g - ing in on quite a different level of ambition. Here are 30 poems by undergraduates, post-graduates and recent graduates from Oxford and Cambridge, all of them much younger than most of the contribu - tors to The New.

This is an attractive little book:, inexpensive , well-produced , as full of promise as a newlaid egg, and if I single out one or two names it is not because I think the others have no talent. Damian ShaWs ""In the Beg in - ning "" seems to me a clever and well-made poem; Michael Theune's ""To Begin an Even Knowing"" is wise in the way that only a 22-year-old can be; while Vesna McMaster (""obsessed by words and writing"" as she writes of herself ) has precisely that sort of perceptive confusion allied to a feeling for rhythm which, refined, might one day make for good verse. All are worth encouragement. So is the magazine Agenda (available at £8 an issue from 5 Cranbourne Court, Albert Bridge Road, London SW11 4PE), which has been going strong since before some of these new young poets were born , but whose continued existence is now threatened by an Arts Council decision to withdraw its grant at the end of this year. The current issue, devoted to the poet Tom Scott celebrates one whose translations of Villon into the Scots tongue can still be read with pleasure. Always dedicated to poet - ry in the highest sense, Agenda deserves to survive.

H ere is an anthology of poems chosen by famous people, with a foreword by Seamus Heaney, himself a famous poet. The project began when some pupils from a Dublin school had the bright idea of trying to raise money for Third World charities in a novel way. . They wrote to celebrities from all walks of life, a preponderance of them Irish, asking them to choose a favourite piece of poetry and to write a brief paragraph ex - plaining their choice. Four of the resulting collections have already been published in pamphlet form, and the present Penguin paperback is a selection of the best of this material. Royalties from the book go to Ethiopian famine relief and similar worthy causes. The volume stands as some sort of testament perhaps, to the persisting importance of poetry in many people's lives. Apart from that, and the fact that it is inevitably something of a glorious rag-bag because the contributors are so various, it seems to me more interest - ing than most anthologies for three reasons.
First, you can see at a glance from it which poets are cur rently most popular, at least with famous (mostly Irish) people: Yeats scores 10, Anon 6, Housman 4, Patrick Kavanagh 4, with Shake - speare and Blake and Hop - kins in next place with three apiece. Second, there is plea - sure and instruction to be had from the short letters in which the choosers seek to justify their choices. Third, and per - haps most intriguing of all, there is the opportunity which the exercise affords of allowing the reader to wonder how much each choice tells us about the contributor. One the last count, when we
LIFELINES An Anthology of Poems Chosen by Famous People Edited by Niall MacMonagle Penguin, £5.99 pbk ARAGE FOR ORDER Poetry of the Northern Ireland Troubles Edited by Frank Ormsby BlackstaffPress, £12.95 pbk see Michael Holroyd going for D. J. Enright's ""Biography "" {Much easier than your works/To sell your quirks), or Mother Teresa selecting a prayer for peace from St Francis of Assisi, the connec - tion between ' celebrity and choice seems quite straightfor - ward . But what are we to make of Conor Cruise O'Brien choosing Milton's ode ""On the Morning of Christ's Nativ ity"" with the news that he usually reads it aloud to his family on Christmas Day, or Chaim Herzog picking ""The
Lake Isle of Innisfree"" ? It is where there is some little interesting distance between the public figure and the private favourite poem that this anthology fascinates. I find it startling and then illuminating, for instance, that Margaret Drabble chooses Blake's three stanzas begin - ning ""Never seek to tell thy love"", precisely because their intense mystery is at odds with the level-headed realism of her own prose. And surely it counts as surprising that David Owen's favourite poem turns out to be ""Candles"" by Cavafy, even though he man - ages to find reasons vaguely to do with his political life for liking it. The book is great fun, and the declared reasons for the choices are in some cases as interesting as the choices. Thus, John Gielgud chooses ""Bredon Hill"" because it was his audition piece for his first drama school; Judi Dench chooses ""Adelstrop"" by Edward Thomas because it reminds her of steam engines and her childhood; and Ben Elton selects the lyrics of Cliff Richard's song ""The Young
Ones"", as they recall for him a poignant moment when Rik Mayall, asked to sign an autograph for a boy who was dying, wrote Young Ones shouldn't be afraid. One minor point: of all the contributors, only Kingsley Amis, David Lodge, and Jef - frey Archer address their young female correspondents correctly as Miss in writing back. For the rest we are in a mess of instant first names, Dear Friends, Dear Lifelines, and the like. Something is being lost from the language by such usages. Famous people ought to know how to start their letters respectfully to less famous strangers. A Rage for Order, edited by Frank Ormsby, also has its origin in Ireland. This anthol - ogy consists of 250-odd poems which directly or indirectly address the conflict in North - ern Ireland, for the most part by writers with roots in the
region but with some contribu - tions by outsiders. There are fine poems here by Louis MacNeice, John Hewitt, W.R. Rodgers, and Seamus Heaney, as well as good work by less famous poets such as Norman Dugdale and Robert Greacen. Poets who take the Troubles for their theme have some - times been overvalued in Eng - land , as though that tragic business conferred instant pro - fundity on the slightest talent. The work to come out of Northern Ireland in the past 20 years, however, withstands comparison with anything being done elsewhere in the English language. For that reason, the book can be read as an excellent collection of some of the finest contemporary verse, but it might also be considered es - sential reading for anyone with a serious interest in modern Ireland.

France where he is a member of that Oulipo group which revels in literary games and puzzles of all kinds,, Mathews may be best known for his novels. This volume — which I would call verse fiction rather than poetry — does add an interesting dimension to the work in prose. In two elegiac poems addressed to his mother, Mathews speaks out sincerely, showing that his passion for artifice is a means of keeping strong feelings in check and not just gamesmanship. The writing of light verse, let alone deliberately comic verse, is of course a tricky business. There is one contemporary who seems to me a master of it, and who gets better with each book. He is Gavin Ewart, now 77, and his 85 Poems shows him at the height of his admirably unsolemn powers.

Deare, if you change, I'll never think of earth And its animals dwelling in ignorance of heaven, Warm and wise without the comforts of fire, Nested in the ground , or in water, or air, Certain of their ways by the day and night stars. With no use for knowledge, or need for faith. An American, long resident in
P enelope Shuttle is a woman of vision. The trouble is: . vision of what? Her poems make bonfires of their own imag - ery , but it is hard to see what is illuminated by the blaze. Yet her writing, even where clumsy and repetitive , perhaps most where clumsy and repetitive, has that unfakeable urgency which comes from a complete confidence in the authority of one's own imagina - tion . When I think of her I think of someone scribbling away, filling notebook after notebook with verses that possess her mind utterly, someone who probably has to tie a knot in her handkerchief to remind herself to knock off once in a while for a bite to eat. Taxing the Rain, her new slim book of poems, is packed with storm and water stuff, mud and splashings, showers and flooded gardens, and there isn't an umbrel - la or a pair of welly boots anywhere in sight. Shuttle favours naked dalliance with the elements. A typical effusion begins Holding the rain in your arms/you grow wiser, wetter! before going on to recom - mend playing the rain like a musical instrument and answering the question Is it horn or string or percussion? with a blunt It is all. Admitting that much of this strikes me as wet rather than wise, I have still to say that some of it is
quite charming, in a dreamy surrealistic way . There is not a lot of craft to the lines, but the best ones have been to school with Sylvia Plath and Mother Goose and have a sort of simple singability. I wish I was more sure of the nature and meaning of Shuttle's vision, that's all. Sometimes she gives the im - pression of being at the mercy of her own imagination, which is perhaps the price she has to pay for such a fertile and distinctive talent. Harry Mathews operates at the other extreme, at least on the surface of his collection A Mid - Season Sky, which is full of poems very artfully made, even manufac - tured . The central piece ""Trial Impressions"" might be taken as typical : it consists of 30 variations on John Dowland's Deare , if you change from that Elizabethan luta - nist 's Second Book ofAyres. Since the Dowland is near - perfect , Mathews runs the risk of seeming a mere parodist, with his modern games turning it this way and that, without discernible pur - pose , save of demonstrating inge - nuity . Yet the final variation, in a sestina of his own making, achieves an eloquence which almost justifies the whole eccentric enterprise:
both wholly characteristic and short enough to quote in full) is ""A Little Loyal Ode to the Queen Mother on her 90th Birthday"": Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon ! It is fit that we should drink to you in a very large G and 77 Mainly because you've been around so long but also because you thought The Waste Land by T. S. Eliot was called The Desert Song! This book, with its epigrams and threnodies, its limericks and potted lives, its jokes and romps and doggerel and crosswords , continues that celebration of all things bright
and frivolous which Ewart has made his own. Yet under the cloak of wit there is a mordant mind at work, directing our attention to the facts of birth and copulation and death with the rudest of two - fingered salutes. Shuttle and Mathews will reward readers pre - pared to work on their opacities, but Gavin Ewart you can read for fun: A big boy kneels at the edge of the sea, A big balloon brandy there by his knee... Whisper who dares! Credibility fails. Kingsley Amis is singing to whales!

SEAMUS HEANEY , Ireland's best-known living literary figure, has a poem entitled Whatever You Say Say Nothing, which deals with what he succinctly termed ""the famous Northern [Irish] reticence, the tight gag of place... "" Yet Heane/s success, and the ongoing clamour of various rich Northern Irish poetic voices, would seem to suggest that, where poetry is concerned at least, reticence is nowhere in evidence . Alongside the man now dubbed Famous Seamus by his Irish readership, there stands the likes of John Montague , Derek Mahon, Seamus Deane, Paul Muldoon, Michael Longley , John Hewitt and Tom Paulin — acclaimed Ulster poets all. Indeed, poetry has flourished to such an extent that if there exists a contemporary Northern Irish literary voice, it is poetic rather than novelistic. If the province were to adapt a Heaneyesque literary motto, it might well be, ""Whatever you write , write poetry."" Given that it is a form suited to contempla - tion of the enigmatic poetry is perhaps the
perfect medium for considering the vexed question of cultural identity in a place where a person's tribal affiliations, be they Unionist or Nationalist , can be simultaneously un - shaka ble and constantly under siege. In Paulin's newly published Selected Poems 1972-1990 (Faber& Faber), he often touches on the ironies of belonging that are particu - lar to the Six Counties. One poem , entitled An Ulster Unionist Walks The Streets Of London, explores the often painfully felt paradoxes of contem - porary Ulster loyalism. It was inspired by a speech made by Harold McCusker, the Unionist MP, on the day the Anglo-Irish agreement was signed. The speech con - cerne d betrayal , an evergreen — or should that be ever-orange ? — Loyalist theme. In his poem, Paulin pictures the MP as leader of some latterday lost tribe of Israel, travelling to London on the "" breakfast - shu ttle "" flight from Belfast, adrift in a political and cultural limbo. In the capital , he visits Kentish Town, and walks around ""like
a half-foreigner among the London-Irish "", a community he has no wish to belong to but whose place in British life seems as assured as his is fragile. The poem's climax imagines the MP fleeing the House of Commons, the epicentre of his betrayal and the symbol of all he formerly held dear. It is, Paulin says, ""a poem about what happens when certainties fall apart, about being British and suddenly feeling homeless even when you are an elected MP."" It is the kind of tortuous, almost absurdist striving for identity that Paulin revisits in his poems and essays, looking back at his native Northern Ireland with an ironic detachment and self - ques tioning honesty that sets him apart from almost anyone else writing about the place. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he doesn't dwell in the ritual tradition. His landscapes are seldom romantic often ominous, the ""brick canyons"" and "" black - ene d gasworks"" of urban Belfast, ""the bungalow on the unapproved road"" that snakes through the no man's land at the border of some desolate ""sweep of broken road between two guarded towns"". He is fond of vernacular language and treasures the rich resonances of Ulster dialect where a
stagnant stream is a sheugh , a whore is a ""hoor"" and vomit becomes the clipped onomatopoeic ""boke "". If much of his poetry is as thorny and spare as, to borrow one of his own descriptions, a ""screggy hawthorn"", there is a tenderness there too. Often, it is camouflaged, on the one hand, by a fierce formal dexterity and, on the other, by an unerring ability to capture the casual cruelty and black humour that is part of everyday banter in Northern Ireland. According to Christopher Reid, his editor at Faber & Faber, Paulin's poetry possesses ""an oral calculation and ingenuity that harks back to Auden"". Paulin describes it, in his inimitably blunt way, as ""fucked up and
abstract"". He was bom in Leeds in 1949, to a Northern Irish mother and an English father , but grew up on Belfast's Ormeau Road. Derek Mahon has memorably described the pre-Troubles Belfast as a city where, ""If a coathanger knocked in a wardrobe / That was a great event"", but Paulin remembers having a fine time ""with a bunch of streetwise adolescents hanging around bookies reading Joyce"". His parents belonged to the Northern Ireland Labour party, held ""vaguely socialist liberal ideas"" and campaigned vigorously against capital punishment. They were also members of the linen Hall Library and furnished the house with books. Paulin seems
to have absorbed not only their love of literature but also their political outlook. Since 1972, he has held a day job as lecturer in English at Nottingham Univer - sity , having himself attended Hull and then Oxford, where he now lives. Although Paulin socialises with fellow Oxford-based writers such as Ian McEwan and James Fenton and professes ""a great admiration for scholarship and what the academy represents ideally "", he is different . His undiminished Northern Irish blunt - ness and his effortless ability to ruffle his fellow academics' feathers lend him a vaguely threatening sense of intellectual otherness that he is bemused by but nevertheless revels in. Given that he has published four volumes of poetry and edited two acclaimed antholo - gies for Faber of vernacular and political verse, it is ironic that Paulin is best known as a lit-crit troublemaker. Indeed, his irregular appearances on television have assumed an almost mythical status in academic circles, turning him into English literature 's reigning, and occasionally rag - ing , polemicist. A few years back he wrote and presented a
half-hour demolition job on Virginia Woolf for the Channel 4 series Taccuse, his octave-leaping and effortlessly indignant Ulster twang adding insult to injury in a sustained assault on the elitist values of the Bloomsbury set. Then there was the now-notorious appear - ance on BBC2's The Late Show last October , when a ""tired and emotional"" Paulin harangued a rather snooty Anthony Thwaite, editor of the Selected Letters of Philip Larkin and executor of the late poet's estate, for supposedly censoring Larkin's more extreme racist comments. What was riveting about Paulin's Late Show performance was the spectacle of someone utterly disregarding the usual rules of the literary debate, opting instead to rail against his fellow academic with a righteousness that recalled the Reverend Ian Paisley in full flow in the House of Commons. The analogy cheers Paulin somewhat, and the sheepish grin that appeared on his face at the mere mention of Thwaite is replaced by a mischievous
<NEWPAGE>
chuckle. ""There are times in criticism when you just want confrontation and blood on the walls in order to break through all that civility and facetious protocol. But I should have done it better. I wasn't grown up enough and I made a bit of a fool of myself. What irks me more is that I wasn't

Book Of Political Verse. The private row became public when Raine wrote a letter to the LRB attack - ing Paulin's review of Geoffrey Hill's book on Milton. A mutual acquaintance told me the two poets have not spoken since. ""Tom and I have a rather precarious friend - ship "", Raine says, ""and I
nave the teeling that anything I say could be misinterpreted. So I'd rather not say anything."" ""Tom is one of the great disagree-ers ,"" Reid says. ""The whole idea of going against the grain seems to give him a great energy."" The Larkin debate was also fuelled by Paulin's distaste for that particular strain of English literary culture characterised by an entrenched reactionary nationalism. ""I know that there is a constant barrage of abuse that persons of colour have to endure in this
adept enough to tease out of Thwaite why he had chosen to excise the letters."" Paulin is no stranger to this kind of intense intellectual swordplay, having fallen out with his erstwhile editor, the poet Craig Raine, after a long-running feud in the letters page of the London Review of Books. The issue then was Milton, whom Paulin regards as ""one of the greatest political poets in the English language"", a view not shared by Raine, who objected to the inclusion of great chunks of Milton in the Paulin-edited Faber
country, he says, ""and not just because I happen to have two mixed-race children growing up here. It's there every day, but in English literary circles there is very little aware - ness of that. What you do have, though, is the smugness of old farts like Kingsley Amis and co — wretched far-right wankers who indulge themselves in their self - disgust by saying revolt - ing things about members of minorities. I
think it's necessary to confront that."" Perhaps, I venture, Thwaite was a soft target for Paulin's ire. This cuts no ice with Paulin, who is now on the offensive with a vengeance. ""Anthony Thwaite"", he says, his eyes widening as he warms to the subject, ""is a little balsawood minor man of letters who is of no consequence at all other than he wants to create this national shrine around Larkin.
""Now , I admire Larkin as a poet immensely, but there is also Larkin the racist. There is this nat - ional monument that the Letters try and construct of our favourite right - wing uncle. You can't siniply have a warm bath in your favourite nationalist author — it's just not on."" There is a slight pause for breath here, then a final flourish. ""There has to be a distinction be - tween the rancid, farting human being and the art. Instead, the two get put together and the effect is to license and palliate vulgar racist views."" In the world of literary scholarship, this kind of emotional outspokenness and fondness for the un - abridged vernacular of the street has made Paulin controversial. He is currently researching a whom he describes as ""a whom he describes as ""a
paper on Hazlitt, brilliantly civil polemicist, tough and gra - cious at the same time"". As his clash with Thwaite shows, when an intellectual issue touches his emotional core, his undoubted toughness is at the expense of such gracious - ness . There is an element here of cultural isolation, and Paulin admits to feeling ""estranged in certain ways, in that this is a more emotionally subdued culture. Anyone who is expatriated misses the communalism of social life in Ireland and all the fun that goes with it."" Yet. when he isn't carried away with his role as literary agent provocateur, he exudes a rather old-fashioned , slightly eccentric charm, and is as soft-spoken as his alter ego is loud. In political, as well as literary, terms, however, Paulin is an effortless dissenter belonging to a progressive ultra-minority that could be crudely labelled protestant republican. ""I suppose I am a republican, but I am as influenced by Milton, Hazlitt and Shelley as I am by Wolfe Tone.
There s a great risk, if you come from Northern Ireland, of being identified trib - ally . The problem with calling yourself a republican is that the likes of Conor Cruise O'Brien have effectively smeared anyone who does that by saying that they, in effect, support violence. I categorically do not."" It is this willingness to transcend the tribal and political ideologies that strait-jacket the Northern Ireland question that make his best writing about the subject so refreshing. In the introduction to his provocative volume of essays, Ireland And The English Crisis (Bloodaxe Books), he mourns the passing of the ""dissenting tradition"" of Ulster Prot - estantism that ""created a distinctive and notable culture in the dosing decades of the 18th century"" . Aligning himself with this long-neglected radical tradition, he then creates a political space for himself that, given his Ulster Protestant background, is both progressive and courageous:""... For the most part I see no contradiction in revering the idea of England, and at the same time hoping Ireland will eventually be a united and separate country with strong cultural institu - tions of its own.""
THE BREADTH OF Paulin's cultural iconoclasm is apparent throughout Ireland And The English Crisis, which includes a devastating critique of the ""static and unfruitful contradictions"" that make up O'Brien 's ""19th century Unionism"", an analysis of Paisley's sermonising that looks seriously at the use of biblical language and allusion by the great loyalist demagogue, and a piece on how scholars have continually overlooked the influence of the Fenian movement on Oscar Wilde. All this alongside a selection of provocative literary criticism that is informed by his antipathy to all things deconstructionist. All Paulin's work is informed by a sense of
reclamation, whether he is historicising writers like M ilton or even Joyce, who he feels ""have too often been detached from their social moment and their cultures"", or aligning himself with the fractured, and endangered, tradition of vernacular verse. In the introduction to his recently published second collection of criticism, Minotaur Poetry And The Nation State (Faber & Faber), he unconsciously pinpoints one of the great strengths of his writing when he says that ""these essays are obsessively entangled with social and ideological questions ... because they are intended to bring to the critical act at least the possibility of a historical method"" .
And, in writing about Yeats or Milton, he homes in on uncomfortable and unresolved ""social and ideological questions"" that con - tinue to resound in Ireland and Britain today. ""Really "", he says. ""I 'm just a failed historian."" When I ask him about one of his favourite topics, Protestantism and the private con - science , his answer ranges through history, art and politics, touching on Milton's republicanism, Shakespeare's medieval Catholicism and the shared sense of ""vernacular primitivism"" that informs the work of Emily Dickinson, Jackson Pollock, Ian Paisley and Van Morrison. It also, however, left me wondering if Paulin's reputation as ""the great disagree-er "" has diverted attention away from his poetry and the important cultural questions raised by his essays. If he is worried by this, he's not letting on. The last word, as ever, is his. ""The great master, Swift, said he wanted to vex people and I'd go along with that. A lot of critics want to have a big party where everyone agrees about everything. I prefer the sort of party where everyone is arguing and shouting.""",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0501973601/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=de185dc9

R ussian poetry is dif - ferent , as Fitzgerald once said of the rich. It has another di - mension of intensity, of public speech, of moral hygiene, of tragedy. The English poet speaks for himself and culti - vates his oddity in a corner of the language; the Russian is ordinary and speaks for every - one . This function of poetry, its familiarity and importance, its conspicuous place at the head of an alternative hierarchy, resists translation into English more than the words them - selves — they arrive with an echo, and perhaps sound hol - low to our ears. In England, poetry is a mews off Grub Street; in Russia, it is celestial, half-Parnassus and half - Hollywood . Perhaps only American po - etry can begin to compare with
it. John Berryman summons ""the worst possible ordeal that will not actually kill him""; Akhmatova asserts that ""Shakespeare's plays — the sensational atrocities, passions, duels — are child's play compared to the life of each one of us"" . Robert Lowell makes his ""manic statement/ telling off the state and presi - dent "" and Pasternak tells Sta - lin on the telephone that he wanted to talk to him about life and death. All are on the Richter Scale, with their exor - bitance and risk. The difference is that the Americans were brinkmen: calculating, perhaps bored; their success or failure mattered only to themselves. It is impossible to imagine them saying (as Akhmatova said): ""The Nobel is not enough.""
THE COMPLETE POEMS OF ANNA AKHMATOVA Translated by Judith Hemschemeyer Zephyr/Canongate, £17 .95 And if they had said it, it would have been a demand for a rise. For the Russians, poetry was not a career, and they toughed it out, none more than Akhmatova: the only game in town. There was a golden age of Russian poetry, but that was in the early 19th century, and, like most golden ages (in fact, it seems axiomatic) it travels badly: Pushkin in translation seems like a lesser Byron rather than a later Shake - speare . Akhmatova became an
expert on Pushkin, and uses his words, sparingly as saffron, as epigraphs for some of her own work. She was, believe it ornot, part of the silver age of Russian poetry: herself, Paster - nak , Mandelstam and Tsvet - ayeva were born in consecutive years, from 1889 to 1892. They are beyond question the most gifted group of poets of the century. Akhmatova, the first of them, was also the last; she died in 1966. Isaiah Berlin writes: ""The wide - spread worship of her memory in the Soviet Union today, both as an artist and as an unsurrendering human being, has, so far as I know, no parallel."" The pupil and protege of her
last years, Joseph Brodsky, offers the best description of Akhmatova's poetry (in an essay, ""The Keening Muse"", included in his Less Than One). She is ""the kind of poet that simply 'happens '"", with - out apprenticeship or discern - ible development, unlike anyone else and impossible to imitate . He calls her ""blatantly non-avant-garde "", ""a poet of strict metres, exact rhymes and short sentences"" . Of these three qualities, only the third can be relied upon to survive in translation; metre and rhyme (the great majority of Akhmatova's poems consist of three or four rhyumed quatrains) have to be imag - ined . Even so, it is enough. Judith Hemschemeyer's ver - sions are the best I have seen; they have dignity and pace,
and are part way rhymed. Above all, her mission to translate all of Akhmatova — for which she taught herself Russian, though working from literal versions, like many translators — proves to have been inspired. This great lilac brick of a book, with 800 poems (some mere scraps of only two or three wonderful lines), a hundred photo - graphs , Berlin's memoir of his amazing nocturnal meeting with Akhmatova in 1945, all annotated and introduced, is a stupendous bargain. Akhmatova at 20 wrote poems in which she was flawless, interesting and her - self . Brodsky comments on the ""terrific novelist quality"" of her love poems, and I was capti - vated especially by her second book Rosaty (1914); those poems were recited in order by
her admirers, round a room. Each one is a moment of great physical and psychological clarity: a room or street, an encounter an exchange of words or gestures, and often some bitter twist at the end. Love can be ""calculating and malicious"", a nightingale sings ""poisonously"", in a Vic - torian image of sexual taint, there is the smell of tobacco in dishevelled braids. A romantic and feted and beautiful youth was mislead - ing and left Akhmatova un - prepared , one would have
thought, for the future: her first husband, the poet Gumilyov, shot in 1921, two unsatisfactory remarriages, the imprisonment of her son under Stalin, deaths and be - trayals and chicaneries. But no, the proportions of bitter - ness and passion in her work were reversed, her poetic re - sources dealt magnificently with what was thrown at her. At 30 she described herself as old and wrote about her losses. She compared her life to a train rushing off the tracks or — that other miracle of Soviet
engineering — a re-routed river. Poetry, she said superb - ly , grows from ""rubbish"". The appalling drama of her life — Shakespearean, as she said — is traced and sur - mounted by the poems. Seam - lessly , a girl's love-poems become the tough lamenta - tions of a survivor. At times I thought I was reading some - thing thousands of years old; the Romans or the ancient Chinese would have under - stood Akhmatova. We are lucky to have this account of her in English.

"Ackroyd, Peter",Ring the fuller minstrel in,The Times,1993-Mar-11,"London, England","Tennyson was the Victorian ideal of a poet, yet his poetry had nothing to do with the life of a celebrity. Peter Ackroyd relishes an amiable and breezy new life of the author of In Memoriam
W ell, Arthur, I mean to be famous."" So Alfred Tennyson told his younger brother, when they were both still children, and it is an early indication of the strength of will which propelled this apparently dreamy and abstracted creature through his long career. He started to compose poetry at the age of eight, and three years later had amassed his lifetime's writing under these headings: ""Vol . 1. The Poetry of Tennyson. Vol 2. The Lyrical Poetry of Tennyson. Vol 3. The Prose Writings of Tennyson."" Here in embryo is the author of Idylls of the King and, almost from the beginning, he was able to command that euphonious sound which is as much a matter of cadence as of mellow open vowels. It was not his invention — you can hear it throughout English poetry — and it was helped by his early acquaintance with classical litera - ture . Virgil is an obvious influence but Peter Levi, himself a classicist, mentions Ovid and Sappho as well as Theocritus. Tennyson found his home in language. The young poet needed all the
ambition and confidence he could muster. He came from a troubled and gloomy family ; his father suffered from fitful insanity, exacer - bated by drink and laudanum, and the melancholic nature of the household is best exemplified by the remark of one of his younger brothers on meeting Dante Gabriel Rossetti — ""I am Septimus, the most morbid of the Tennysons."" By the time he reached Cam - bridge , this ""great poetical boa - constrictor "" , as Thackeray called him, was already a striking figure . ""That man must be a poet,"" one of his contemporaries noted at first glance, and over the years he became an icon of the poetic temperament. With his hat, his voluminous cloak, and his blue - tinted spectacles, he often caused a sensation on the streets. His ap - pearance was half patriarch, half gypsy, with his distracted expres - sion , his tempestuous hair, and what one female acquaintance called ""a very decided nose"". The
Victorians believed that they were in the presence of some divining fire. He really came upon the world with the Poems of 1832, but not quite in the manner he expected. It was an age characterised by review - ers almost as foolish as our own, and Tennyson was one of those unfortunate writers who are un - doubtedly affected by criticism in the public prints. He was, Levi writes, ""crushed"" by the invective against a volume which included ""The Lotus-Eaters"" and ""The Lady of Shalott""; but no great writer can remain in a semi-recumbent pos - ture for long, and the sudden death of Arthur Hallam in the following year brought him back to his feet (and his metres).

» ——^ -^^^^^^ H^a MBH^^^^^^^^M^^H ing with it 50 years later — never can a threnody have taken so long to complete but, on the other hand, few have found so large a public. It became the keepsake of the 19th century. It did not always elicit quite the right response, and one reviewer apparently believed that this work ""was by the affectionate widow of a military man"" . Levi's biography is full of such asides and diversions: it is an amiable and almost breezy study which proves that it is not necessary to be solemn about greatness. It is disappointing only when it be - comes enmeshed in detail. The difference between a novel and a biography, after all, is this: in a novel one is bound to tell the truth, whereas in a biography one can make things up, by which I mean that the biographer is obliged to impose a pattern upon the narra - tive of a life in order to establish its meaning. Perhaps, in Tennyson, there are too many facts and not quite enough pattern. But Levi has read widely and deeply in the literature of Tennyson's age, and it
is refreshing to come across a biographer who knows more than the collected works of his subject That is how he is able to locate him within the full movement of his time, revealing in the process how much Tennyson was part of his period: he was, like Dickens, a great inclusive genius. It is easy to regard him as a poet of the mournful lyric or the Arthurian epic, but his poetry is filled with intimations of theology, natural science and evolutionary theory; while within the cadence of his verse he is able to depict the real life of industrial England. By the time he published his Poems of 1842, which includes some of the finest verse of the 19th century , he had proved himself to be, in Levi' s words, ""a great and a popular poet, inimitably various ... "" Certainly, he makes most modern English poetry seem very thin gruel indeed. Within a short time, he had become a grand if not necessarily old man of English letters. Yet throughout his life he was most notable for his innocence and
simplicity; there was an infantile streak not very far beneath the surface of his genius. He sucked on his pipe continually, he drank a bottle of port every night, and always ate a portion of apple pie. He remained what many of his friends described as a ""great child"". But if so, he was one of those strange infants who keep a distance between themselves and the world. What is most striking about this biography is the extent to which poet and man .led separate lives. Levi remarks that ""he relied deeply on himself and there was within his character an inner momentum that rarely connected with his ostensible existence in the world. He does not seem to occupy his life at all, but inhabits some other place where all that matters are words and the sounds of words. And this is a region through which even the most assiduous biographer cannot follow him. ""He would have wished,"" Benjamin Jowett wrote, ""that , like Shakespeare, his life might be unknown to posterity"" . In a sense, as always, he got his wish.

"Dugdale, John",Just how do we remember them?,The Times,1993-Mar-09,"London, England","Just how do we remember them ?
As their anniversaries approach , John Dugdale assesses the war poetry of Laurence Binyon and Wilfred Owen
Laurence Binyon, the 50th anniversary of whose death falls tomorrow, secured his niche in history through the poem ""For The Fallen"", first published in The Times on Septem - ber 21, 1914, in response to early British losses in Flanders: They shall not grow old, as we that are left grow old: Ageshall not weary them, northe years condemn. At the going down of the sun and in the morning We will remember them. Despite the incongruous echo of Shakespeare's Cleopatra ("" age can - not wither her"" ), the lines have a ponderous, mock-antique elo - quence which allows them to pass for an addendum to The Book of Common Prayer. They have be - come the official expression of mourning for the Great War dead, engraved on countless memorial
stones and incanted at countless memorial services. Elgar set them to music. In this sense Binyon is the best known of the first world war poets, remembered for a promise to remember. Others are more cele - brated , but their work is not publicly recited throughout the country each year on Armistice day. Aged 45 when war broke out, Binyon spent it working at the British Museum, where he was a keeper in the department of prints and drawings; he published semi - nal studies of Oriental painting and the followers of William Blake. By September 1914 he was also of sufficient standing as a poet and verse dramatist to be invited (in the distinguished company of Thomas Hardy, Arthur Conan Doyle, John Masefield and G.K. Chesterton) to attend a secret conference for men of letters organised by a new
government propaganda section. ""For The Fallen"" was his dutiful contribution to the war effort. When it was reprinted as part of a War Poems from The Times supple - ment in August 1915, Wilfred Owen, 22, was returning from southern France to England in order to enlist. His reaction was lukewarm approval (""Binyon — all right!""), but at that stage he still largely shared the same conven -
Great War writing continues to shape the way the British imagination responds to war tional view of the war, with its linked myths of heroism and Christ-like self-sacrifice . After his first experience of the Western Front in early 1917, however, he could no longer treat death as an abstraction, erasing the appalling reality. The opening of ""Anthem For Doomed Youth"", his own tribute to the fallen (""What passing-bells for these who die as cattle?""), is manifestly unsuitable for memorial services. And ""Dulce Et Decorum Est"" directly chal - lenges ""the old Lie"", the non - combatant 's notion of battle as the perfect arena for a dignified patriot - ic demise; by depicting in detail a soldier being poisoned by gas. Other frequently anthologised works; such as ""Spring Offensive"" and ""The Sentry"", are similarly
centred on first-hand reportage — usually combined with an explicit or implicit appeal to the compas - sion of the reader, or with angry protest directed against desk - bound hawks in Whitehall and greedy profiteers. In the climax of ""Insensibility "", regarded by many as his greatest poem, this anger is powerfully fused with late-Roman tic lyricism. By choice they made themselves immune To pity and whatever moans in man Before the last sea and the hapless stars; Whatever mourns in man when many leave these shores; Whatever shares The reciprocity of tears. March 18 sees the centenary of Owen's birth. His reputation re - mains healthy, and his work is still widely read, particularly in schools
— although it must be said that academic criticism, preoccupied with the Modernist motorways Eliot and Pound were already building in 1918, tends to view war poetry as a rather dull B-road . The Chatto edition of the Collected Poems , edited by Jon Stallworthy, Owen's biographer, regularly sells 6,000 to 7,000 copies a year, assisted by its presence on A-level syllabuses. Jon Silkin's Penguin Book of First World War Poetry has been in print ever since its first appearance in 1979. The contemporary relevance of Great War writing is obvious and — despite the competing influence of post-194 5 American fiction — it continues to shape the way the British imagination responds to war. Tumbledown, Charles Wood's television play based on the story of ah officer wounded in the'Falk - lands conflict, picked up the argu -
ment against the cult of the hero where Owen left off. Blackadder Goes Forth, the BBC sitcom set in the trenches of Flanders, began as black comedy, blending Oh What A Lovely War! with Catch-22 . But the final episode, in which the characters went over the top, took its tone from Owen and his mentor, Siegfried Sassoon. Owen died in action on Novem - ber 4, 1918, a week before the Armistice was signed. His own vision of his subsequent career, had he survived, can be inferred from ""Strange Meeting"", a Dante-esque dream poem in which a soldier meets the enemy he killed: death, the ghost says, has prevented him from revealing ""the truth ' untold/ The pity of war, the' pity war distilled"". On this basis, Owen would have joined Vera Brittain
and her colleagues in the inter-war peace movement. The late George MacBeth envis - aged the railway clerk's son writing ""more directly involved poetry about the problems of the working classes"" than the socially privileged Auden gang of the Thirties. David Bradshaw's Dictionary of Nat - ional Biography essay surmises that Owen ""would have grown in stature to span the native tradition between Thomas Hardy and Philip Larkin"".
He would have been bound to his domineering mother — and half enjoyed it. He would have gone on writing, but the great gifts stirred in him by the war would have died down as his memory healed. ""Eventually , he would have found his way back to Catholicism, like Sassoon. He would have died in the early 1960s, honoured but slightly diminished by his later works, which would have suffered greatly from his hostility to Modernism."" A Tony Harrison of the 1920s, a left-wing social realist, a flag-bearer for old-fashioned verse that rhymes, or a bumt-out case: all are equally plausible,. The career of Robert Graves, the longest survivor among the leading first world war writers, is an effective deterrent to facile extrapolation: had he too died
H owever, Andrew Mo - tion , Larkin's biogra - pher , recently sketched a less glorious possible after-life :' ""He would have become a homosexual prep school master in Shropshire, with a pipe! patches on his elbows, and terrible memories.
in 1918, as a promising young member of the gentlemanly Geor - gian school, only a clairvoyant could have foreseen Laura Riding, The White Goddess, the Claudius novels and Majorca. Owen's squalid, senseless death froze him in glamorous potentiali - ty , like Rupert Brooke: Binyon's weary words (""They shall not grow old, as we that are left grow old"" ) unwittingly anticipate this process, and hint at something close to envy of those released from time and disillusionment. Binyon himself was successful in all three of his careers, as poet, art historian and museum curator. But ""For The Fallen"" proved to be his only brush with popularity, and when he died in 1943, his intended magnum opus, the verse drama Merlin, was left unfinished.

"Nye, Robert",Sickness unto death in verse,The Times,1993-Feb-06,"London, England","Sickness unto death in verse
T hey say that John Berryman turned to wave a casual farewell to some passer-by before throwing himself to his death from a bridge in Minneapolis 20 years ago. His poetry is like that too. Offering crazy intimacies to its readers, it goes plunging suicidally down the page in desperate pursuit of meaning. The results can be criticised as obscure in their remorseless self - reference , but the best of his work has a passion and a lucidity rare in modern American verse and un - usual anywhere at any time. I remember him once attacking aca - demic criticism with the remark
that when Shakespeare said he had two loves of comfort and despair he wasn't kidding. It is that quality of Not Kidding which may enable Berryman to live on as a poet where most of his contemporaries seem already dead on the page. The Dream Songs is his longest and most ambitious work, as well as his richest and most difficult, and Faber serves his memory well by issuing it now in a single paperback volume. First published as two separate books — 77 Dream Songs (1964) and His Toy, His Dream, His Rest (1968) — this is a sequence of 385 poems, each poem arranged in three six-line stanzas, the lines
varying greatly in length and stress, the stanzas in rhyme pattern. The subject is, broadly speaking, the phantasmagorical doings of a white man in black-face called Henry, or Pussy-cat . Henry's drunken adventures are chronicled, employing the lingo of a minstrel show; at other times he is heard in meditation or in colloquy with a friend who calls him Mr Bones. Behind all these masks, inform - ing these various procedures, the real subject is Berryman himself, the poet in the modern world, a dreamer at odds with society. The process seems truly phenom - enological in that the verse takes in anything and everything that comes to hand. It also gives off a sense that it might not have taken the poet much longer to write the stuff than it takes us now to read it. The probable model here is Whitman's Song for Myself. Like Whitman, the overall sound is loud, but the lines that speak most clearly

THE DREAM SONGS By John Berryman Faber. £9.99 pbk THE PATIENT George MacBeth Hutchinson, £7.99 pbk MASS FOR HARD TIMES R. S. Thomas Bloodaxe, £12 ^ 95/£5.95 pbk shock with their quietness: Life, friends, is boring. We must not say so... The Scottish writer George Mac - Beth died early this year from motor neurone disease, and The Patient collects his last verses. It is in many ways a brave and touching volume, with a delightful line drawing of MacBeth on the cover (a drawing which must have been made by his widow in the last months of his life). As a poet, MacBeth seemed to me to
improve a great deal in the latter part of his career, the palpable change of direction in his work seeming to have something to do with his removal about ten years ago from London to Norfolk and his starting to write a smaller and more particular kind of poem about what he found in country living. This is not to say that he settled for being a ""nature"" poet or anything like that, just that he began to work at limiting the somewhat restless ambition of his earlier work, discovering a home for his imagina - tion in things nearer to hand, and his verse became the stronger for it. The Patient contains poems in which matters of life and death are presented with the unmistakable authority of experience. Once upon a time MacBeth's work was dressed to kill but had nowhere to go. By the end, it had achieved every appear - ance of plain urgency, whether the poet is writing about relationships with others, writing light-hearted
tributes to his friends, or facing up to his own increasing disability and approaching death. The short se - quence of sonnets included here on the last subject is the outstanding thing in a moving little book. Back in the Fifties, when most of the verse being written in English looked and sounded as though it had been compiled by a committee for a committee, the work of the Welsh clergyman-poet R.S. Thomas seemed to stand out by reason of a clean personal imprint, its stamp as of a man with a keen sense of his own identity and his place in a living community, as well as a man possessed of things which
were his alone to say. I think now this must have been an illusion. Either that, or Thomas has deteriorated. Whichever view is correct, the poems in his latest volume Mass for Hard Times strike me as thin and banal. Bleak Liturgies, as one of them is called, would serve to define nearly all of them. While respecting the integrity everywhere apparent in Thomas, not least in his devotion to his flock (/ was vicar of large things/in a small parish, as he wrote once), I have to say that in my opinion this volume records the death of a poet under a weight of ecclesiastical self-discipline .

THE FABER BOOK OF MODERN EUROPEAN POETRY Edited by A. Alvarez Faber, £17.50 * T his is not a bad anthology — no book with selections from Montale, Ritsos, Enzensberger and Herbert can be altogether bad — but it has to give best to Daniel Weissbort's The Poetry of Survival, which appeared at the beginning of the year. Weissbort identified the terrain, and had first use of it: broadly, the central European experience of the second world war and the division of Europe. His book is the outcome of a life's work down the mines of poetry translation (for which he has absurdly been called a careerist), and is still loose and negotiable; Alvarez's seems more like an ] afterthought. j It is hard to make good anthologies without a j background, and , as Alvarez says in his j introduction, ""until quite recently, foreign ; ; literature, particularly foreign poetry, has not j fared well in Britain"" . In one way, Alvarez's j effort is not part of that ""recently "", although he { obviously hopes to prosper from it: rather, he is j anthologising from memory, from his own memory of editing the classic Penguin Modern European Poets list in the Sixties. Twenty-five years ago he was a wonderful reader and critic of poetry (if you ask me, there is still an Alvarez - shaped hole), but since then he has been on holiday from it, writing books on divorce, rock - climbing , gambling and such like. The con - sequence is that the introduction is recycled hat, the choice of poets uninspired, the selections out of date . Getting there after Weissbort, Alvarez has extended his field to take in western Europe and the Mediterranean countries (although he won't have anything from Iberia), but his heart remains north and east of the Danube. Of 34 poets, he has six Poles, three Czechs and four Hungarians. The result of the geographical spread is a certain diffuseness and a feeling of ""if he liked that how can he like this?"" Some literary tastes date a man like fossils date a rock. I wonder if Pasternak, for instance, has made any converts since his poetry arrived on the back of the Nobel prize and DrZhivago in the Sixties: he has never seemed to me much good in English, but there he is in Alvarez. The same with Celan — but he has to be there. Some of the poets are makeweights: Voznesensky, Petri the Hungarian, the French Jaccottet. There are peculiar selections from Brodsky and Montale. There is really no such thing as European poetry. The poetry of the eastern bloc, written with clarity, coolness, ideas and as few words as possible, sits oddly with more traditional verbal and rhetorical poetry from Italy and France. It seems to have been written in order to be understood, and not, as Wallace Stevens once said poetry should do, ""almost successfully resist the understanding"". There is a premium on difference. We are enlarged by a poem that is straightforward to read, tells an historical anecdote in nondescript diction and ends with a twist: something like Adam by the Romanian Sorescu, in which our founder-father goes on making women from his ""intercostal harem"" until God finally expels him from Eden ""for surrealism"". In eastern Europe, meanwhile, there is an appetite for prosy, humdrum, self-deprecating British poetry, and they are translating Philip Larkin with loads of mistakes. We all need the other.

Made of the Wright stuff
Wha t have Australia, Bulgaria and ancient Greece in common? Some - thing wonderful: senior women as leading poets. Judith Wright, one of the most distinguished poets of her generation, country (Australia ), and our time, 1992 winner of the Queen's Award for Poetry, frontline conserva - tionist and human rights activist , is a poet of true fire and craft, with the serious sparkle of vintage champagne. This marvellous A Human Pattern: Selected Poems from her 12 books, (Carcanet, £14.95), closes her poetry career. It is more important now, she says, to ""get things done"". To reverse Australia 's ""legal fiction of terra nullius"": the pose that when settlers came there was ""no onethere , nullus, to whom terra could belong. This terra's supreme poet, of its ""delicate gatherings of dancing trees"", never ducks its violence: Here, twisted in steel, and spoiled with red your sunlight hide, smelling of death and fear , they crushed out of your throat the terrible song you sang in the dark ranges. The torn mrrigal ""voice from the hills"" is lover, mythic heroine, elegy-maker Hurling your woes at the moon, that old cleaned bone, till the white shorn mobs of stars on the hill of the sky huddled and trembled. Every word precise. None lazy. This is poetry of search, ""for wholeness"", for ""understanding what was happening to me and around me"". Its guilt does not flop about like English guilt. Describing an early massacre, settlers forcing aborigines over a diff, shooting those who wouldn't jump, she brings the tragedy home: Did we not know their blood channelled our rivers and the black dust our crops ate was their dust? O all men are one man at last. We should have known the night that tided up the cliffs and hid them had the same question on its tongue for us. And there they lie that were ourselves writ small... In her first book (1946), Wright emerged as a war poet : We meet and part now all over the world.
we, the lost company, take hands together in the night, forget the night in our brief happiness, silently . She was a trail blazing love-poet too. A penis, ""eyeless labourer in the night"", opened the title - p oem (on womens sex-experierice ) of her second collection , Woman to Man. In the Sixties , Eve to her Daughters was a flag-poem for the Australian womens movement. We should all be so lucky, at 70, to have produced such a body of work: with a compelling political edge and a wonderfully cadenced personal voice. Bulgaria mirrors this with another septuage - narian leading poet , Blaga Dimitrova, whose The Last Rock Eagle has been translated by Brenda Walker with Vladimir Levchev and Belin Tonchev (Forest Books, £6.95 pbk). Dimitrova (born 1922), Bulgaria's new vice - president fuses geo-political anger with the poetry of attachment — domestic, mythicised — earmarked since Sappho as women's poetic territory. Lines to Vaclav Havel, as Sisyphus, bite like Cassandra: And still the boulder doesn't crash ' ' down in the ravine... Do you want something more impossible, like balancing that boulder on the ridge that took such toil to get it to the top?
WOMEN POETS *
Dimitrova is badly served by the translation. Words like ""toil"" won't do. According to Julia Kristeva, Dimitrova turns thought into poetry"" in Bulgarian. Phrases like ""unquaffed sunsets "" do not do this in English. However, sometimes you see what Kristeva means: In late autumn — a chestnut in bloom. A yellow leaf-fall and cranes leaving. And on branches — the wig of spring. ""Wig"" hints at the real poem's life. And occasionally her thought hits through with heartbreaking directness: When hope comes true it's only thenyou realise you never really hoped. For Elizabeth Jennings (bom 1926), ""life is mostly inner war"", but, she says in this lovely new collection , Times and Seasons (Carcanet , £6.95 pbk), poems work suffering into ""good dark shape"" . Much-loved poet of mental anguish, love, religion, nature , and childhood, Jennings gives us moving poems of loss. In a terrifying poem on adult abuse, a priest forbids Communion for the sin of doubt: The priest was twisted, sick. I felt no hate For children think they cannot change such things or run from them... Even this is turned to dark good shape: God, you meant terror once. But maybe this Brought me close to your mysteries... And gratitude from which Fve power to build Music the poem, and all they are witnesses of. Judith Kazantsis's new collection, The Rabbit Magician Plate (Sinclair-Stevenson , £7.99 pbk), is a two-edged lament for dvilisedness. Joseph - Columbus , on a ""fog-filled , milky"" hill ""of many colours"", plunders South America, prods the rotting crust of the dump and finds a glass bottle no one else found and sticks it in his plastic sack for resale. Indian children, ""fluff before Custer ""s hoofs, arechopped back"" like weeds. Josephine Balmer, introducing her lovely translations of Sappho: Poems and Fragments (Bloodaxe, £6.95 pbk), suggests why it took so long for womens poetry to take fire in such themes. Sappho, ""the tenth muse"", was quoted most for relationship-poems : Love shook my heart like the wind on the mountain rushing over the oak trees. A specialisation crystallised in the famous fragment: Some say an army on horseback, some an army on foot, some say a fleet of ships is the loveliest sight... but I say, it is what you love. The direction and the weight of this specialisation were both transformed first by Wright's generation, which began, at least, to explode prejudices (exemplified by Sappho's male readers, and beautifully analysed by Balmer) in response to women's poetry through the ages. Women — acknowledged as leading poets , in countries where poets voice political issues compellingly — now use love and myth in the service of the personal and the political . In Wrighf s poetry above all, ""what you love"" is land and all it signifies. Land's rights ; rights of its people. Terra not nullius, but firma. Image of Wrighfs own, bone-clean poetry .

T his is an anthology of the prose and poetry that has provided pleasure and inspi - ration to Denis Healey throughout his life . The bulk of the book is provided by the author's chosen literature. His connecting text is modest but helps illuminate a singularly successful political career that stopped only just short of becoming leader of the Labour Party. It also makes dear that his rumbustious and occasionally vul - gar public reputation was just a veneer containing an intellect that clearly overshadowed his Balliol contemporaries , Roy Jenkins and Edward Heath. The anthology is pleasurable on account of the literature selected and also for the insight it pro - vides of Denis Healey outside the world of politics. The author's choice includes a number of lesser known poets. In particular he underlines the virtues of the work of Emily Dickinson who ""can pack more meaning into forty words than some writers get into forty
pages"". . Another favoured author is Thomas Traherne, a mid - nth - century shoemaker's son , whom Healey discovered whilst an Oxford undergraduate. He writes: ""since then I have returned to him again
! MY SECRET PLANET By Denis Healey MichaelJoseph, £16.99 and again for inspiration."" The passage chosen! for My Secret Planet comes j from one of Traheme's ""Meditations"" and con - cerns the ""wonder of childhood"". It is powerfully written but without cloying sentimentality. In addition to the relatively unknown poets Healey also acknowledges the in - fluence of the familiar names including Gerard Manley Hopkins and Dylan Thomas.
One of the attractions of the book is that the prose and poetry come from a balance of contributions, ranging from the very familiar to the relatively unknown. Inevitably the book will be examined to find some explanation of Healey's polit - ical career. His outstanding scho - lastic successes at Oxford had prepared him for an academic future. It was not to be. He served in the second world war, seeing action in Italy, but ""when I was demobilized I decided not to write my great work on aesthetics as a don at Oxford, but to
go into politics — since there seemed no other way of helping directly to prevent a Third World War"". Healey makes clear that his socialism was of a general kind, related to the concept of the brotherhood of man. It is also evident that his flirtation with communism at Oxford was very much the effervescence of a lively intellect The book, both in the author's commentary and the anthology, confirms that Healey, as defence secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer, was a pragmatic right-of-centre politician. That fortunately, does not pre -
vent the occasional sarcastic broad - side that discomfited his oppo - nents . In the section on boyhood he discusses the William books of Ricmal Crompton. ""Violet Eliza - beth , with her constant threat to 'thcream and thcream' till she's sick, seemed all too credible, though it was late in my life when I first came across the type in reality — and then in Downing Street."" The main fascination of the book lies outside Healey's political career . The sections of the antholo - gy devoted to the Arts and Nature are particularly rewarding. The author writes ""Oxford , the war, and politics all taught me the limita -
tions of scientific reason as a guide to human beings. Fortunately I have always found the arts an inexhaustible source, not only of pleasure , but also of knowledge and understanding ."" These sentiments inspire some readable and risible excerpts. Notable is Berlioz's de - scription of Liszt giving an after - dinner speech at a banquet in Prague. Its inclusion is as unexpec ted as it is amusing. Denis Healey acknowledges the importance of the countryside and nature . His Yorkshire upbringing was urban but closely linked to the stark grandeur of the nearby moors. Inevitably this has resulted in an appreciation of such well
known rural chroniclers as Kilvert and Housman, but Healey also acknowledges the work of Tony Harrison, a contemporary Leeds poet and John Clare. The latter was a Northamptonshire peasant writing in the early 19th century. His poem , beginning ""I love at early mom from new mown swath to see the startled frog its route pursue"", simply sparkles. It is a further example of how the lesser known authors add lustre to an anthology that ranges from classi - cal to contemporary times and from the great names to the obscure. Of course the question abides whether or not the anthology
reveals the author. There is pro - foun d sensitivity, when Healey describes the death of his mother and again in the anguish of Virginia Woolfs letter on her impending madness; there is a profound love of the arts and countryside, and there is great intellectual confidence in a mastery of philosophy . All this seems some - what at odds with the bruising politician that Westminster came to know, respect and half fear over his 40 years in the Commons. I am prepared to believe that My Secret Planet does reveal an authentic Denis Healey, and if it does not then the anthology is a thoroughly good read in its own right

I'M CONTEMPLATED BY A PORTRAIT OF A DIVINE by Jo Shapcolt
I cannot speak to you. My lips are fused where an archangel kissed them. I have never made much of myself although I know, sometimes, that space is touching me because I have seen the crack in the universe through which the galaxies stream. O God. I will always know how to walk, no rest, until it just ends in blackness when I fall down flat. I have one arching eyebrow: my whole life is in that eyebrow where an angel nestles at the root of every hair, raising it up. Dear Christ. I can hear vice rushing through
the grass. There is someone here. If I could lick the glass clean from this side, I might sec her, though I already know she would look the way I want my soul to look.

"Hofmann, Michael",Exiled by militant rhyme,The Times,1992-Aug-22,"London, England","Exiled by militant rhyme
C hinese poetry is usually pre - sented in the most disas - trously heavy and off-putting way in English. A scholarly introduc - tion fills most of the book: a few tiny ribbons of text, each of them trailing notes, resemble so many jellyfish; and at least one hefty appendix at the end. It looks like an attempt to extinguish these tiny poems with prose; to imitate on paper the vast and inhospitable spaces of the Middle Kingdom: to enforce on the poems conditions of bureaucratisation, exile and separa - tion like those endured by the poets in their lifetimes. Even though Vikram Seth is more a poet than a Sinologist, he follows a similar pattern in his Three Chinese Poets. A slender selection of 36 translations from the three 8th - century masters, Wang Wei, Li Bai and Du Fu (more familiar as Li Po and Tu Fu) is bulked up by his own naivdy informative prose. If this is I disappointing, it is nothing compared to the disappointment with the style of the translations, which might be des - cribed as Californian Georgian. Seth, best known for his bestselling novel in verse, The Golden Gate, is an apologist for what Americans call Forma] Poetry. The Formals proclaim the old virtues of metre and rhyme and, er, storytelling. One should not JJ expect coherence from a warcry.
THREE CHINESE POETS By Vikram Seth Faber ,£l2.99/£6.99pbk a
.^ Three Chinese Poets was under - taken by Seth partly in homage to three great translators. Richard Wil - bur (Moliere). Charles Johnston (Pushkin) and Robert Fitzgerald (Homer). Their fields were comic dramatic and epic verse. However in I tackling lyric Seth overreaches him - self and reaches for the wrong tools. I have nothing against rhyme as such, only against Fundamentalism, Militant Rhyme, and the supposition that if something rhymes it must be good. You get bad poems that rhyme and bad poems that do not. Rhyme is not what sorts them out, and neither is it an infallible way of producing good writing. Rhyme is a robust effect, and lends itself to comic effects. Byron and Shelley were contem -
| poraries and in-laws of sorts, but it is the Byronic line that has prevailed, and Shelley's ghostly fluency has never been matched since. Of all poetry I know. Chinese is the i weakest — it has least strength and I most beauty. It seems to me that rhyme, even when ideal Shelleyan rhyme, is inimical to it, and Seth's is far from ideal. His quatrains are as I coarse and knocked-together as i wooden crates. These sparest, most I perfect of poems, where every line, j every pen-stroke must be just-so , are | horribly over-punctuated , they arc padded to make the syllable-count come out right, their diction is barren, crude and compromised and they are without atmosphere and aroma. Chinese poetry in English can never be ""real ""; it is an invention of the translator and so tends to chinoiserie. Some of the best ""Chinese"" writing is deeply inauthentic it is by Pound, or in German it is by Brechu it is Joseph Brodsky's marvellous Letters from the Ming Dynasty , Derek Mahon's Japa - i ncsc The Snow Party, or John Berryman's Note to Wang Wei. ""Chinese"" is a style, a metaphor , a content, a resource of English. What Seth has done, in presenting what he I thinks arc echt and conservative j tr anslations, is incomparably worse: I he has written merely some dire and I dapped-out anglaiserie.

THE FABER BOOK OF TWENTIETH-CENTURY SCOTTISH POETRY Edited by Douglas Dunn Faber, £17 .50 ?- iar ... MacDiarmid made a lan - guage as he wrote"". But unlike Joyce, the aesthetic exile, MacDiarmid lived in Scotland all his life, and restored a native lyric conscience that had lain dormant. MacDiarmid tried to amalgamate an extraordinary compound of nationalism, communism and avant - gardism , and remains the most influential figure in Scottish poetry since Burns. But his ideas and achievements were fraught with so many contradictions that his omni - presence is expressed through the ways in which others diverged from his example. In addition to the Scots of MacDiarmid, Robert Garioch, Syd -
T his selection accommodates 400 pages of poems by 72 poets, from Scotland's proto - modernist John Davidson (born in 1857) to a clutch of robust experi - mentalists in their early thirties. Douglas Dunn's erudite introduction outlines the diverse metamorphoses poetry has undergone north of the border since T.S. Eliot wrote that ""there is no longer any tenable distinction to be drawn"" between Scottish and English literature. That was in 1919, when Andrew Young, William Soutar and Edwin Muir, the other pioneers impressively repre - sented here — and, most substan - tially , with 35 pages, Hugh
MacDiarmid — were only beginning to sharpen their deliberately sepa - ratist pens. In 1923 MacDiarmid scented a ""strong moral resemblance"" between Jamieson's 1808 Etymological Die tionary of the Scottish Language and Joyce's Ulysses. For the following decade, he forged most of his verse in the long disused smithy of Synthetic Scots and the vernacular Lallans (so - called because it deployed words and expression from the dialects of low - land Scotland). Dunn explains that this is ""a language in which old words are used in poetry with the force of neologisms, the shock of the unfamil -
ney Goodsir Smith, Tom Scott and others, and the Scottishly inflected English of most of Dunn's assembly , the third resonantly poetic language of Scotland this century is Gaelic. It can be heard here in manifold forms, with translations, from Derick Thom - son , Iain Crichton Smith and the wondrously bardic Sorley MacLean. V irtually every poem in the collection exemplifies — pace Eliot — a highly distinctive orality, precision and passion of word music. These are qualities shared by the continuing literatures of most tribal or folk cultures: East and West Indian poets and Jewish ones come to mind as articulating communities at once cosmopolitan, separatist and deeply imbued with race memory, and similarly enlivened with several idioms to draw from and extend. As Dunn says, and his anthology indicates, ""most Scottish poetry, when compared to its English counterpart, stands in a closer
relationship to its potential audience"" . Two of the more maverick writers featured are the Orcadian storyteller George Mackay Brown, and the incantatoryW.S. Graham. Two of the most eclectic mid-century makars are Norman MacCaig and the inter - nationalist Glaswegian Edwin Morgan. I was equally delighted by the variousness of resource, energy, style, wit and inventiveness on display in the latter sections of the book from Ivor Cutler, Alastair Reid, George MacBeth, Kenneth White, Alan Bold, Alison Fell, Brian McCabe and Carol
Ann Duffy. Liz Lochhead and Tom Leonard are among the contributors who deftly versify the uniquely abra - sive panache of Glasgow street life and speech rhythms. Despite what strikes me as a number of glaring omissions — the innovators Ian Hamilton Finlay and Thomas Clark, ""inner space"" explor - ers such as R.D. Laing, playwright - poets John and Tom McGrath, and songwriter-singer Robin Williamson — this is a richly instructive and enjoyable cornucopia. It demon - strates that, in the face of at least as much hardship and discontent as the rest of Britain, the muse is alive, well and kicking in Scotland.

Playwright Christopher Fiy talks to Peter Lewis about his success, years of British neglect and a revival at Chichester
W hen Christopher Fry's verse play, Venus Ob - serve d , opens at Chich - ester Festival Theatre tomorrow, it will be its first perfor - mance in a major theatre for more than 40 years. It will also be an opportunity to reconsider the fervent esteem in which Fry's work was held then, and its neglect since. Venus Observed was commis - sioned by Sir Laurence Olivier to begin his tenure as actor-manager of the now long-defunct St James's Theatre in January, 1950. In the same month, Fry's name was on the boards outside two more London theatres. At the Globe, Ring Round the Moon, his translation from Anouilh with Margaret Rutherford; Paul Scofield and Claire Bloom, followed straight upon The Lady's Not for Burning, in which Pamela Brown and John Gielgud had been the toast of the town. Gielgud had moved to the Lyric Hammersmith, to direct Fry's ear li - er play. The Boy With A Cart, in which the boy, the future St Cuthman, was played by the young Richard Burton. Fry was the writer in demand by actors and directors. ""I was rather jealous that he had given his new play to Larry instead of me,"" recalled Gielgud of Venus Observed.
The play had to be written to the deadline of Olivier's opening night, as Fry remembers: ""I had promised to send him a draft of the second act and when it failed to arrive, I received a parcel containing a typewriter ribbon, a brush for the keys and a note from Olivier 'If there is anything else you need, let me know. I'm not making you nervous, am I?' The trouble was that Peter Brook had simultaneously talked me into translating Ring Round the Moon for him to direct."" Fry managed to finish the play but was never quite happy with Venus Observed. ""I always prom - ised myself that if I lived long enough I would revise it nearer my liking. When I heard of plans for this revival I said, only if I can make some changes. I didn't find it difficult to get back into it after 40
years. In some ways I feel I know how to do some things a bit better now, at 84, than I did before."" You believe him , for he looks unmarked by time, exactly resem - bling his photographs of at least 20 years ago. He has a nut-brown , co in - sharp profile, that of an alert but peaceable Roman emperor. Fry's revisions for Chichester have reshaped the play in two acts instead of three, cutting passages and remodelling one character. The play begins with an ageing duke, in his private observatory, deciding to marry at last and settle down with one of his former mistresses — until a new young beauty swims into his ken and awakens his old yearnings for pastures new. The ducal castle
Try's lines are not strictly verse (being without regular metre), but rhythmic prose, cut up into lines of four or five beats' setting and socially superior charac - ters are worlds away from most modem English drama, even if the theme — love in youth and- age — is timeless. But what utterly differentiates a Fry play from anything that fol - lowed the Royal Court revolution is his extravagantly non-naturalistic use of language. With Fry, dialogue is employed to make music, to pursue conceits of imagery and also to make sport in verbal games of high-spirited metaphor, puns and sudden drops into comic bathos. It is not the way people communi - cate on buses or television, but it was the way language was employed on the stage from Marlowe to Dryden. Fry's lines are not strictly verse, being without regular metre. They
are rhythmic prose, cut up into lines of four or five beats, lines which are undetectable when spoken, except for the spring they impart to his long and complex sentences. Poetry, Fry once wrote, ""has the virtue of being able to say twice as much as prose in half the time"" . But, he added, if you don't pay attention carefully, it may seem to say half as much in twice the time. ""I 've never liked the term 'verse drama',"" he says. ""It sounds terribly stuffy, doesn't it? Really you are trying to find the language that says what you want to say. When I began writing, it was hardly a new departure. Yeats and Masefield, Auden and Isher - wood , MacNeice and Eliot had been writing poetic plays from the early years of the century."" Like T.S. Eliot Fry began writing
drama for performance in church. The Boy With a Cart was originally given in his local parish church in Sussex in 1938. He was influenced by Eliot's Murder in the Cathedral. Later he wrote Thor With Angels for Canterbury cathedral. The encouragement of his friend Robert Gittings and of Eliot himself helped Fry develop, at the age of 40, from being a part-time theatre director and odd-job man into perhaps the leading playwright of the postwar deeade. And then suddenly, after a dozen years, it was over. His plays, like Eliot's, Rattigan 's and Coward's, were swept into limbo by the critical and popular enthusiasm for plays of social indignation from Osborne, Wesker, Arden, and absurdist dra - ma from Beckett, Ionesco and Pinter.
For Fry, the limbo lasted for decades and the hostility shown to verse drama dried up the wells of his inspiration. Even in 1954 Kenneth Tynan was writing: ""If Mr Eliot and Mr Fry can be persuaded away from their martyrdom in a lost cause, the theatre would benefit."" Fry's subsequent plays, The Dark Is Light Enough and Curtmantle, took him longer and longer to write and raised comparatively little en - thusiasm , even some derision. All that poetic stuff, it was implied, was
very as an escape post - war austerity but that time had passed . ""I lost confidence,"" he says now. ""I didn't know what theatre I was writing for. I sat at the typewriter wondering who wanted what I could provide. I felt more or less unwelcome."" So neglect set in. When Mrs Thatcher announced of herself that ""the lady's not for turning,"" how many people recognised that her speechwriter was borrowing the phrase from the title of a Christo - pher Fry play? He looks back on what must have been a shattering reversal of fortune with the philosophic detachment of a Quaker , untinged by bitterness. The gap was filled partly by film - writing — Ben Hur, Barabbas and
The Bible—a television series on the Brontes, and a new play about Caedmon, One Thing More, on radio. But apart from radio and amateur productions, the plays have lan - guished except abroad. Eastern Europe, when communist, pro - duced them and in America they are campus favourites. Fry has recently returned from lecturing American students; a full-scale study of his plays by Brenda Leeming has been published by Twayne of Boston. Was it a lost cause or is the tide turning? Are audiences ready to re - discover the taste for poetic drama they had 30-40 years ago? James Roose-Evans , who directs Venus Observed at Chichester with Donald Sinden in the Olivier part of the
Duke, is convinced that the time for a Fry revival has arrived. Why should stage poetry only be appreciated in reaction to wartime deprivation? Fry , with characteristic modesty and mildness, is reluctant to talk in terms of changes of taste. ""Why does there have to be only one ruling taste? Literature has room not only for fiction but for biography and poetry as well. Why can't we have theatre which contains the poetic as well as other approaches to life? Surely the important thing is that there should be every kind of theatre."" Venus Observed begins previews from tomorrow at Chichester Festival Theatre (0243 781312) and opens there on May 27, continuing in repertory untilJuly 30

Sir Kingsley Amis's most ambitious novel revolves round a bad Russian poet and an old-fashioned don, says Daniel Johnson
His publisher will hate me for saying so, but at its deepest level The Russian Girl is about neither Russia nor girls. Poetry and truth, Dichtung und Wahrheit, Goethe called his autobiography Kingsley Amis might have recycled that title for this* his most ambitious novel. Whether the book succeeds or not whether this is Amis at his best (and that, for my money, is better than anybody else's best), depends on whether poetry and truth matter any
supposed to be the guardians. This retreat from the lofty bastions of scholarship has nothing to do with ""funding"" but everything to do with cowardice in the face of militant intellectual egalitarianism. For those who do give a damn, Amis has in store intelligent in - si g hts into the decay of intelligence: a dialogue so dazzling, indeed , that those who find themselves among his targets may even enjoy their own discomfiture. But there is emphatically no conclusion, no statement .
more: to us and to one another. Amis, of course, thinks that they do.
THE RUSSIAN GIRL By Kingsley Amis Hutchinson, £14.99
Though its sat - ire is even more sulphuric than usual, The Russian Girl works on a plane normally reserved for a genre Amis probably despises: the ""novel of ideas."" He makes the plot of a conventional story about adultery (English academic married, falls for sexy Russian poet who has enlisted his help on behalf of her imprisoned brother) turn on the evanescence of truth in an age in which there are people who do not know ""what meaning what you say means. Everything's just saying what you say."" He cares, too, about a state of affairs in which the novel has submitted to an unfriendly take - over bid by politics — ""No fiction, no art, just statements"" — and in which England is a last refuge ""where admittedly a lot of fellows would like the novelist to be writing autobiography or social history or gossip rather than fiction, but what's left will last a little while yet"" Not many, perhaps, give a damn about that. Amis has some fun with the debasement of the cognitive coinage of which universities are
demic conform - ists , champagne socialists, phonies of all kinds — will find plenty of ammunition here. But Amis deals just as harshly with his representa tives of poetry and truth, all of whom are flawed , especially the chief characters: the Russian girl , Anna Danilova , writes bad poetry and her suitor , Richard Vaisey, sacrifices his integrity by pretend - ing that it is not. Poetry and truth share a tend - ency to be incompatible with most kinds of modern life, and in the remaining few they seem incom - patible with each other. Richard is a scholar — in Amis's estimation, a man who has either consecrated his life to the truth, or is a parasitical fraud . Vaise/s intellectual life rests on fidelity to Russian literature, his emotional life rests on fidelity to his wife Cordelia, and his material existence rests on her inherited wealth. He later discovers that his sanity actually depends on his friends: Cordelia's previous hus - band Godfrey and his brother Crispin in particular. Once Anna has forced herself,
alive and insistent into the inner sanctum hitherto occupied by a literature that is merely immortal, Richard's fragile equilibrium col - lapses . He cannot reconcile the mediocrity of her poetry with her radiant truthfulness except by abandoning the premise without which his critical faculties are neutralised. ""Yes , but is she any good, is he any good."" No longer to be ""a stickler for merit"" means that his life in pursuit of truth in poetry is over. Cordelia's physical assault on the trappings of that now invalid-vocation propels Richard into the — for him no less exiguous — adventure of life with - out scholarship, but with Anna.
Cordelia, the chief villain, is a vintage Amis character. Her. fright - fulness is capable of enveloping such innocent operations as pour - in g tea or making a telephone call. The emptiness of her life is a familiar theme. She scores over earlier Amis she-devils in her knowingness, her bullying conde scension, her refusal to exact re venge until she is good and ready. Cordelia is a monster not on account of her irritating voice and habits but because she banishes even the possibility of poetry and truth from her presence. The action is precisely dated in June 1990, and Amis is withering about the reactions evoked here by
the death throes of Soviet commu - nism . One of his best comic figures is Sir Stephen, a fashionable archi - tect whom Richard and Anna try to enlist for their petition. This novel owes much to Robert Conquest, whose poetry inspired Amis in the 1950s and whose prescient books on the Soviet genocides did so much to ensure that some people in the West never lost sight of the evils of the Soviet empire. Mention of the early Amis brings me to the two reprints which coincide with The Russian Girl. A Kingsley Amis Omnibus (Hutchin - son , £15.99) brings together three of his later novels —Jake 's Thing, Stanley and the Women and The
Old Devils — while Penguin have reissued his first, Lucky Jim (£5.99), with an introduction by David Lodge . The new book stands comparison with the funniest of these, Lucky Jim and The Old Devils,- and colonises new regions of experience untouched by either. Amis is now peerless among ser ious British novelists, rivalled only (and quite distantly) by his son Martin in breadth and by nobody in depth. Recognized at last by Mrs Thatcher's knighthood, decent to the young and more convivial than some might think, Amis is yet still an angry and isolated figure. An arresting passage in The Russian Woman has Richard stuck in a
traffic jam outside ""a large building of Victorian date"" near Trafalgar Square — surely the Garrick. The porters escort an old man, ""weep - ing copiously"" down the steps to find him a taxi. Amis does not look forward to his dotage. But there is no sign of any diminution in his powers — rather the reverse. Next week he is seventy. The Russian Girl, in which he hits the top of his form, suggests that old Kingsley will continue to sur - prise us all. TOMORROW Valerie Grove talks to Sir Kingsley Amis

ROBERT NYE: Going to the Dogs Come Friday night my father's public vice Was a greyhound track. He took me there twice.

To choose a trap my poor Dad bruised his wits Perusing form, and when that failed had fits Of asking me my fancies. What this meant For us made going to the dogs quite different. Once the choice dog in the pre-race parade Excreted what looked like bad marmalade. ""A sign,"" my father said, ""from heaven sent! You do know going to the dogs is different?"" He'd urge his favourite home with passionate cries. The keenest still brings tears into my eyes: ""Come on, my son!"" It was an accident Which our dear going to the dogs made different. I can't remember what my old man won; God knows he lost much more in the long run. His coat was shabby and his hat was bent, But going to the dogs I found him different.

That both Hamlet and Newman occurred to Hopkins is one reason why he presents difficulties for many readers: he lived in two worlds which have not Had much to do with' each Other for a long time: the _ worlds of Efiglish Roman Catholicism and of literary genius. Depending on
which sphere the commentator comes from, writing about Hopkins tends either to the pious or the impious, and neither version com - prehends what it is to have, as he had, a devout imagination. Norman White's new biography is, then^ all the more welcome. It is deeply researched arid deftly writ - ten , brims overwith tact and insight ; nobody has written better about Hopkins's care for the minutiae of natural history. He marshals so many details so well, from the menu of Balliol College in the 1860s .(""rissoles , 9d, half a goose, 1 s 3d"" ) to the state of the drains from which Hopkins probably caught the ty - phoid he died of. This is a work of studied love for its subject; there is unlikely to be a more scrupulous
biography of the poet in my lifetime. And yet the book is speckled with misplaced self - con - fidences . It tells us what Victorian Englishmen thought about the
Irish, though Carlyle, a Scot, is not a convincing source to quote for English views, just as Tennyson's poems of the 1840s are poor evidence for the claim that ""many poets in the 1870s and early 1880s were obsessed by the mystical significance of twilight"". These are venial errors, but they hint at something wrong in the air of the book, like the musty smell which may betray dry rot. The actual rot nestles in this author's unexamined assurance that he knows what's what about his own period and so can pronounce about the past. ' Hopkins wrote several poems in praise of soldiers, including ""Yes . Why do we all, seeing of a soldier, bless him?"" White flatly declares this poem ""embarrassing to modern minds"" . I don't like it much myself, -but the first duty of literary people is to exercise imagination. Identifying one's own mind with the modern mind is a habit of the intelligentsia, a bad habit, and a bad place to start on the more subtle task of imagining the past. We most long for security about the ultimate and the intimate — I mean religion and sex — and consequently are least imaginative about these matters. To be imagi - native takes ""steadiness of nerve"". White's nerve understandably fails him, facing Hopkins in whom these two tricky factors are multiplied by each other. Though White strives a bit to be fair-minded , he will not manage to be even that until he learns to have, at least for a while, a
mind other than his own, and gives up, for instance, saying that Hop - kins was mistaken about how to deal with his own depression. If White really knew how to deal with de - pression , rather than just ticking Hopkins off, he would be a richer man than, I imagine, he is. When Hopkins taught classics to Irish Catholics, he did not skip the descriptions of rapes and suchlike; he would let the class read them and
afterwards hold up his hands and say ""O those poor girls"" . That took some nerve in the Dublin of those days. On the other hand, he wrote the great poem ""To what serves mortal beauty —dangerous ... ?"" in which White detects a ""cer tain deviousness"" because it argues that carnal beauty is perilous but is created by God as the mark of selfhood, and of God's love for the human soul, and therefore a fit
subject for the attention even ot a priest. On this matter, the poet had a more modern mind than his biog - rapher has, because one of the few goods blown to us on the ill wind of Aids is that we rediscover, in our world where it matters for sex to be ""safe"", the point to Hopkins's "" dan - gerous "" . Ars longa, vita brevis : this could now be translated as: ""Art lasts, biographies pass away.""

E lias Ashmole, the 17th - cen - tury antiquary and scholar, chose to employ the ancient spelling of the documents he pub - lished because ""Old words have strong Emphasis"". It was a wise course then, and it is an even wiser one now, when the language has been tarnished by promiscuous use. It has become larger but more nebulous, so standardised and flattened that the decision of the editors to retain the original spelling and punctuation within this anthology of Renaissance poetry is a wholly necessary accomp - animent to what is in any case an enterprising selection. To ""modernise"" a poem is to corrupt and destroy it: boude has a
different circulation from blood, byrds and floures belong in older gardens than birds or flowers, and the sonn, sune, sunne or soonn is part of a different constellation from that of our own modern sun. The original words put the poems back in their vital context: this is also the aim of the anthology itself, which aspires not to some timeless heaven of poetical treasures but to the living culture in which the verse was fashioned. Of course the Renaissance, in an English setting, can mean anything or nothing; it covers a period that includes Doctor Dee and Thomas Hobbes , and runs the gamut (as this volume illustrates) from John Skelton to John Milton.
It was the period of the individual and the period of the modern state, the era of science and the era of alchemy, an age of inductive reason - ing and an age of vigorous super - stition ; like any age, therefore, it is indefinable except in terms of our
own contemporary preoccupations. Certainly such pre - occupations play a part in the making of this volume; there is more attention paid here to the work of

female poets, for example, than in any previous anthology. But preoccupa - tions change. When the modernist writers and their academic disciples were advancing the concepts of ""ambiguity"" and ""complexity "", it was the intellectual fashion to promote Donne and demote Milton; but that rage for difficulty has burnt itself out, and now the critical judgment is all but reversed. N evertheless, the contem - porary thematic structures which the editors have cho - sen do seem appropriate to their task. Some of the sections , ""Topographies "" and ""The Public World"" among them, make perfect sense of. the material, although there is something perhaps a little too post-modern about that one which deals with ""the production of poetry itself. It is also instructive to have one part entirely devoted to the vexed question of poetic translation, even though more of Chapman's Homer would have been welcome.
Translation of course raises the even more vexed question of "" English - ness "" itself:, is there any recognisable or valuable continuity represented by these hundred or more poets? Is there some chronological resonance be - tween generations, to be observed in the continuation of a certain cadence or form? Is there, in other words,
some poetic equivalent to that ""undulating double curve"" which Nikolaus Pevsner lo - cated in The English - ness of English Art> . But the editors seem wary of any such
nationalistic approach: they have included Irish and Welsh poetry in the original and, in his preface, David Norbrook comments rather too ju - diciously on the dangers of ""cultural imperialism"". It has to be said that most of the poets included are cultural imperialists of one kind or another, because they were concerned to memorialise and celebrate their cul - ture ; Spenser and Milton, the two greatest poets represented here, considered the English to be the chosen race. Various other questions arise from this collection, not least the role of the poet and the status of his work. The
editors are reluctant to raise questions of value and instead provide some - thing close to a representative social range, as an alternative to that persistent over-emphasis upon aris - tocratic individuals and ""private"" lyrics which characterises earlier anthologies. In this they are remark - ably successful. Not only have they brought attention to poets who are generally disregarded — John Hey - wood , George Gascoigne, Richard Barnfield and Rachel Speght among them — but they have also provided space for some of the rarer long poems of the period: Ralegh's The One and Twentieth: and last hooke of
the Ocean to Scinthia is one example. So this is an intelligent and com - prehensive anthology, and not the
least of its virtues is the social and historical introduction provided by Norbrook. Here in condensed form is an account of why poetry matters in human society, as well as an explana - tion of the political dimension of all serious literature.
In a recent volume of essays Tom Paulin exposed the nervous pol - itical collusions at the centre of much modern English verse, and here the editors have been able to perform the same service for the poetry of the 16th and 17th centuries: there is hardly a ballad, and certainly not an epic or an ode, which is not part of the general dispensation of the time. They are able to trace the path of religious controversy both in Den - ham 's landscape and in Surrey's translations of Virgil; even in the world of sexual love, with its strident chorus of lyrics and sonnets, the ""political issues"" are still maintained. Yet such an emphasis can some - times lead to a certain heaviness of interpretation or analysis, and the
most significant omission here lies in the failure of the editors to examine the relationship between poetry and music in a period when, arguably they reached the finest point of complementarity. There is not a word here about Byrd, and only one song is taken from Dowland's Second booke of songs or ayres, without any explanation of Dowland's impor - tance . This complaint aside (and where would Renaissance poetry be without its complaints?) ThePenguin Book of Renaissance Verse can be commended for the subtlety and care with which an extraordinary literary period has been restored.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0503292794/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=a27544fe

The sequel and showcase for the next generation, Grandchil - dren of Albion: An Illustrat - ed Anthology of Voices and Visions of Younger Poets in Britain, is, Horovitz claims, only one of several sequels he has in mind. Large dreams, great visions fuel this enterprise. Horovitz has fought his battles through the Albion anthologies, his New Departures editions and the Poetry Olympics readings which he started in 1980 ""to restore adventure, enjoyment, answerability and interna - tionalism to a climate of poetry readings which was then by and large in the little - Englandist doldrums"" . When Children of Albion came out in 1969, Ted Hughes wrote that ""for me it is full of surprises, real new beginnings"". In 1992, Albi - on 's grandchildren provide fewer surprises simply because many of the voices here already have large and enthusiastic audiences for their work: John Agard, Sujata Bhatt, Merle Collins, Carol Ann Duffy, Linton Kwesi Johnson, Grace Nich - ols , Fiona Pitt-Kethley , B en - jamin Zephaniah. No-one could make the claim for these grandchildren that they are underground poets like those featured in the 1969 anthology, even though, for the new book, Horovitz has tended to choose work where the poet takes the role of outsider or critic. Adventure, enjoyment, an - swerability and international - ism can be found in abundance in Grandchil - dren of Albion and it may be a measure of some of the changes that Horovitz has been working for that these ideas have now . burrowed risht to the heart of contem - porary poetry in all its forms.

A major drawback of the an - thology is that there are too few surprises and new begin - nings among the many less well-known poets included, although the Slovene Ifigen - ija Zagoricnik was one who reached out and grabbed. But Grandchildren of Al - b ion still has plenty of shocks in store . For a start, the book looks unusual , designed to ambush us at every turn. It begins on page 17. Pages one to 16, the introduction and rationale, are published else - where . The poems and lyrics are interspersed with illustra - tions , some by the poets themselves. Drawings and sketches crawl all over the pages and it is a pity that too often they are not intrinsically interesting enough to avoid making a clutter of an already substantial book. Horovitz has deliberately chosen to include work which blurs the boundaries of poet - ry : poems which move to - wards graphic art in their presentation, song lyrics — sometimes a song complete with musical notation. It is certainly not all poetry for the page, and even excellent lyri - c ists and performance poets sometimes look weak in this context, alongside writers like Sujata Bhatt who are fa - voured by the page. Perhaps it is impossible to play but the intention of this anthology between book cov - ers at all. Poetry, as Horovitz has Beckett remind us in the dedication, ""is not only to be read. It is to be looked at, and listened to"".

"Hofmann, Michael",Surviving under Big Brother,The Times,1992-Feb-13,"London, England","Surviving under Big Brother
T his is the best anthology of modern poetry for 30 years. Not since I came upon Alvarez's The New Poetry (first published in 1962), have I had this sense of the collective statement of an excep - tional generation, of a mass of powerful new material, gradually finding shape.and identity, of so many outstanding poems and so many new names to follow. In The New Poetry, Alvarez put together four. American poets and 24 British; it looked like an admonition to the British to learn from the Americans, and it worked. That anthology — with Lowell, Plath, Gunn, Hughes — heralded the excitement of the 1960s, when the dominant poetry was American and American - insp ired . Since then, the fulcrum of poetry in the world has shifted back east, and Alvarez shifted with it. In the late 1960s he became the advisory editor of a series called Penguin Modern European Poets, where Amichai, Celan, Holan and Her - bert first appeared. Daniel Weissbort and Ted Hughes got together to found the magazine Modern Poetry in Translation. There were festivals, readings,
publications, exchanges of letters. They were cosmopolitan times ("" the good old days"" Amichai calls them in an interview, also printed here), and Weissbort has drawn heavily on them in this anthology. About a third of his poets were in that Penguin series; others have been published in small or special - ist presses here or in America; two are presented for the first time in English. To have selected 28 poets from eastern Europe, written essays introducing their work, with a bibliography and interviews with some of the poets, and all in a durable form — Penguin will be publishing the paperback in due course — is a great responsibility, and Weissbort has performed it magnificently. He has identified the essential subject or determination of this poetry, survival, and accepted geographical limits and chrono - logical ones. All his poets lived through the second world war and its aftermath; roughly speaking, they are the generation of the 1920s. This gives the book a coherence,
A new collection of iron curtain poets causes Michael Hofmann to recall a lost generation an intensity and a shared experi - ence , which otherwise Weissbort is hard put to describe, talking as he does about ""an aura that em - braces their work. It is a kind of fellowship... ""' This occasional incoherence isn't detrimental, though. It comes out of his continuing engagement with the work. It helps to makf The Poetry of Survival what it is: not a closed, cut-and-dried , canon - ical type of anthology, but more an instinctual one, and Weissbort's instincts are true. For instance, his decision to
THE POETRY OF SURVIVAL Post-War Poets of Central and Eastern Europe Edited by Daniel Weissbort Anvil £19.95 begin with Brecht. Brecht is gener - ally vilified in this country, and to set him at the head of this anthology may seem strange, a communist wolf before dissident sheep, only the other poets are not sheep and I am sure they recognise Brecht as one of themselves, with his clarity, brevity, intelligence and concreteness. His unrhymed poems with irregular rhythms — devised so as to be ""reasonably
invulnerable to interruptions"" (by jamming) — are an apt and evocative way in. As I read through the anthology I asked myself repeatedly, where do these Myrmidon poets come from, what is their Gogol's ""Overcoat "", who is their father — and of course the answer is Brecht. In time, the uniqueness of the 28 poets represented here will be seen; they will make some sort of group like the War Poets or the Romantics. Their part of the world bore the brunt of the war and housed the death-camps . They went straight from the Brown terror to the Red, without passing
go. While the west looked on, complaisant or anguished, their countries were hostages to peace. There, poetry was the last thing on anyone's' minds, but still it ap - peared in the reduced, stubbly, oblique form they found for. it - - Actually , it was anti-poetry , anti - language . It was their leaders who fancied themselves as belletrists. Stalin got on the phone to poets, Ulbricht addressed meetings of the writers' union, they all had their lives and their speeches published in many volumes. The poets are the opp - osite , describing themselves vari - ously as ""an outside member who would never presume to label himself a poet"" (Holub), someone who ""never felt myself to be a poet"" (Pilinszky), who imagines ""a p oet - ry without qualities, a poetry which would be anonymous again"" (Rozewicz). Never in history have there been poets who had such a deep quarrel with language: as Celan, who wrote in German, the language of the murderers of his parents, but broken into pieces and re - fash - ioned ; as Dan Pagis, who taught himself Hebrew in order to write;
as Pilinszky with his ""ascetic renunciation of words"". Bachmann, Holan, Herbert, Rozewicz; they all inveigh against language. I am talking about this antholo - gy as an event in English, even though it is the opposite of most English poetry, which is picky, cluttered, unmomentous, anecdot - al , individualising. In the poems here, you see the wood, not the trees. They mean to be useful (Brecht's favourite word!) even when they only dramatise their usefulness: ""/ want to be on time/ even if I am too late"" (Jerzy Ficowski). It is not because I feel sentimental about the countries and the poets and what they have suffered. Their achievement — and that of their translators, most of whom, fascinatingly, are not native Eng - lish speakers, and whose versions, Weissbort says ""need not be in - stantly recognisable as a poem in English"" — makes me wonder whether the possession of one language, and an innocent unbro - ken relationship to it, will ever again be able to make great poetry. This anthology sets new bearings.

"Dannatt, Adrian",Feminist verse and its pitfalls,The Times,1992-Feb-08,"London, England","Feminist verse and its pitfalls
If the very nature of poetry is to vanquish the cliche, it is perhaps forgivable to be suspicious of poetry with an agenda. All three of these poets are politically engaged feminists, working in a terrain rich in cliches. Adrienne Rich, the only full-time poet of the three, with a 40-year career behind her, has achieved in An Atlas of the Difficult World a summation of her themes and talents. The long title poem is a triumphant vindication of the potential of her form. Margaret Atwood and Alice Walker, both better known as novelists, cannot compete in their poetry with Rich's subtlety and sophistication. Curiously, the quality of the poetry is inversely proportional to the span of the work. The weakest volume, Walker's, represents her complete poems, from 1965-90 , while Atwood's is a selection from ten years. Rich's slim but superior book covers

only 1988-91 . These qualitative dif - ferences are not a matter of content: both Rich and Walker write about the political prisoner, and all three poets are concerned with questions of race, ecology, gender and human rights. Atwood and Rich each has a poem entitled She, and Walker has one called She Said. They all largely employ loose, rarely punctuated free verse; a lyrical, fluid style that requires special care. Rich's lines are of a kind that everyone feels they could write, but very few can; her lines are as long and elegant as Walker's are short and bumpy. Their meanings are smuggled past with grace. Rich's title poem takes on nothing less than the state of America, and is a Whitmanesque ode to that stalled dream , as realistic and pessimistic as Whitman was euphoric and
optimistic. Rich transforms events that may have briefly registered as news into human experience. The notes give the source of one section as an account of an attack on two lesbians, taken from Gay Community News. The final part of the title poem is an elegiac haunting address to the reader — every and any possible reader, business executive or parent, of either sex. In the second part of her book, Rich deals more directly with her Jewish childhood and the Holocaust, a theme which, like the slavery Walker addresses, may be all too familiar but is nevertheless important. How to deal with such monstrous historic
material without adding to its banalisation is a problem faced by all three poets. Atwood's boundless verbal facility, her punning gymnastics and essential wit, do not always redeem the obviousness of the material — that exploitation, torture and masculinity are not, on the whole, nice. Certain words recur in each poem with an obsessive touch: 34 counts for the word ""blood"" and 34 also for ""red"" out of 73 works in total, not including A Red Shirt, in which the colour appears 11 more times. Atwood's poems bubble, drift and gurgle with that Seventies idea of sisterhood as largely made up of bodily fluids, which seems, in retro - spect , biologically reductive. But if Atwood's women seem dated that is nothing compared to Walker's songs of praise for Winnie Mandela or the Sandinista government. Their eulogistic enthusiasm now has a sinister ring. Walker is above all honest, which makes one doubt whether honesty is
necessarily the best policy when it comes to the lyric arts. There are good poems here, for example Light Baggage, a wise, delicate treatment of ambition and the renunciation of success: fishing in the waters of experience a slouched back against the shoulders of the world.
The disappointment is that there are only a handful of decent poems in 25 years of work. The beginning ""snapshots"" of Africa , neo-haiku dog - gerel written at too young an age, make one long for those poets who used to buy up and destroy their embarrassing juvenilia. In the preface, Walker explains that she has not deleted or changed anything she has written, whereas she quite obviously should have done. Walker terms Reagan a ""bad actor"" and praises Malcolm X in equally obvious ways. Too many lines border on agitprop parody. These three books present women as the political and social radar of a deadly world. If Walker or Atwood can shame us for being male, Rich both shames and empowers us all for being human.

R evision : seeing again. For the revised series of Oxford Books of Verse , which will influence the taste of a generation, OUP commissioned a fresh reading of the huge corpus of our poetry. The most recent results are Alistair Fowler's New Oxford Book of 17 th - C entur y Verse (published today) and Emrys Jones's 16 th<entury volume (published last year). Nearly five centuries and more than 800 poets are now represented , yet even at 3,500 pages, these volumes are scraping the surface, not the barrel. As well as adjusting reputations up and down — Philip Larkin's 20th-century Verse notoriously found no place for Ezra Pound — these anthologies have brought to light many scarcely known poems and poets. Emrys Jones includes one poem apparently never before printed, and some neglected tender lines by Thomas Bastard about a child learning to speak: ""the soft air the softer roof doth kiss / With a sweet dying and a pretty miss"". Christopher Ricks's Victorian Verse revives Shirley Brooks's ""Poem by a Perfectly Furious Academician"" :
I takes and paints, Hears no complaints, And sells before I'm dry, Till savage Ruskin He sticks his tusk in. Then nobody will buy. The earliest tradition was courtly and semi-official . Henry VIII, Eliz - abe t h and James I all have poems in these volumes. In 1599, Samuel Daniel hoped this national litera - ture would rival that of the ancients. O blessed letters, that combine in one All ages past, and make one live with all By you we do confer with who are gone And the dead living unto council call By you th"" unborn shall have communion Of what we feel and what doth us befall He thought the genius of the lang - ua g e ordained for the production of great works, and in general the old Oxford anthologies agreed. But alongside that canonical history the modern editors value diversity and introduce unrequired writing, voices from the anonymous mass There are versified prayers and wills,
doggerel notes on husbandry, dialect poems, epitaphs and the exuberant dementia of Christopher Smart. Without looking below the first rank, Fowler might have filled all his 800 pages with the 17 th century's unmatched lyrical exploration of love in all its forms, running from Fulke Greville and Drayton (overlapping here with Jones) to Traheme and Rochester. But he also admits ""some 'sub - literary verse, and some very minor poets"", for ; ""If literature ,is the nation's memory, forgotten verse may contain things we need to know"". One thing we especially need to know is what women's verse was like , and Fowler has practised ""positive discrimination"". As well as including women in his New Oxford Book of 18th-century Verse , Roger Lonsdale went further, producing a full-scale anthology of 18th-century Women Poets. Though not included there, the anonymous anguish of ""Epitaph on a Child Killed by Procured Abor - tion "" is surely a mother's: Soften the pangs that still revenge thy doom:
NEW OXFORD BOOK OF 17th-CENTURY VERSE edited by Alistair Fowler OUP, £25 mSmmmS^Smm^SmSSmS^SS^SS Nor, from the dark abyss of nature's womb. Where back I cast thee, let revolting time Call up past scenes to aggravate my crime. With hundreds of ephemeral poems called back from oblivion to set beside the Augustan classics, Lonsdale's 18 th century is radically political, particularly as it draws to its troubled close. Cowper, James Grainger and others denounce slavery; William Shepherd lam - basts imperialism; Mary Acock and James Bisset decry child labour. Not that all the verse Lonsdale prints is good. Who can have patience with stuff like this: ""In yon deep bed of whisp'ring reeds / His airy harp shall now be laid"" ? There is too much mock-heroic Miltonic grandeur. Thus sports are routinely aggrandised. Bowls: ""A large smooth plain extends its verdant brow"" ; golf: ""th' exulting orb as - cends ""; cricket: ""And see where busy counties strive for fame"".
A fter a century too much lulled by rhyming couplets, Victorian poets weighed up their words as well as their syllables. Feelings were understated and compressed into sonnets and tight stanzas (Housman, Hardy) to make the reader attend to every nuance. Ralph Hodgson could imply years of misunderstanding in the appar - ently neutral tide ""Silver Wedding"". Lord de Tabley could write 40 delicate and precise lines about a spider. Out of such restraints burst Hopkins. Even in the best tilled ground, these editors have found neglected furrows, such as the impotence poems of the late 17th century . Out of Horace , perhaps, but very Eng - lish is a long series of poems of leisured contentment: Lord Vaux""s praise of thinking (1576), Edward Dyer's ""In Praise of a Contented Mind"" (""My mind to me a king - dom is... "". 1588k Henrv Wotton's dom is... "", 1588)Henry Wotton's
, 'The Character of a Happy Life"" (1651) and Robert Southwell's ""Content and Rich"" (1595): ""My wishes are but few, / AH easy to fulfil; / I make the limits of my power / The bonds unto my will."" Mildmay Fane, in 1648, p redi - cates his serenity upon being at one with nature: - •.;. ... observe by reason .why every plantobeys its season; How the sap rises, and the fall. Wherein they shake of f leaves and all... Which whilst my contemplation sees I am taught thankfulness from trees. Unmistakably, this green wisdom is a pre-echo of Marvell's ""Upon Appleton House"" — the most perfect of all long poems, though sadly not printed entire by Fowler. Similarly, Lonsdale prints two poems addressed to Coleridge and two on Tintem Abbey. But because the Romantics fall between the 18 th century and the Victorians, they are to have a volume to themselves. And after that? Well, despite a new jacket recently, Helen Gardner's 1972 New Oxford Book of English Verse is beginning to look rather staid.

Null,"Of poetry, politics, spooks and God",The Times,1991-Nov-30,"London, England","Of poetry, politics, spooks and God
I POLITICS I I Joku OmtbeB ] The book of the year? No competition. Roy Jenkins's A life at the Centre (Macmillan, £20) is in a class of its own. Unlike the normal run of self-serving political memoirs, this is a genuine autobiography : a professional biog - rapher turning his polished skills on his own career, able to draw on his contemporary notes to recreate events with almost novelistic detail, but at the same time review his own part in them with the perspective of a historian. Although sometimes verging on self - parody , the book is a treat for con - noisseurs of the high Jenkins style , at once orotund and precise. Runner-up ? Nicholas Ridley's My Style of Govern - men t {Hutchinson, £16.99) - once again, less a conventional memoir than a robust vindication of Margaret Thatcher and all her works, written from within by an independent-minded courtier , and aimed particularly point - edly at the troika of disgruntled ex - collea gues who brought her down.
I SPOOKS AND SPIES I I Chris Petit | Whoever pressed the fast-forward but - ton on European history has left thriller writers double-guessing , and often wrong, now that huge political shifts occur more rapidly than publishers' deadlines can accommodate them: the noise heard most often is that of the author running for cover . The best—all American — went their own way. Richard Condon blew the whistle on the US, yet again, in The Final Addiction (Michael Joseph, £13.99): criminal syndicates , politicians, intelligence agencies and the media are all shown to He easy in the same bed. Charles McCany's Second Sight {Hutchinson, £13.99) completed a panoramic seven - part survey of a lifetime in espionage (and of America's clandestine history), the literary equivalent to a wide-screen epic. Benchley's Chip {Robert Hale, £14.95) by Carl A. Posey proved, in spite of low-grade packaging and drab printing, one of the most readable, and ambitious, thrillers of the year — Dostoevsky in the Balkans.
FASHION I I Liz Smith One privilege of writing about fashion is seeing In close-up the cut and craftsmanship that goes into clothes. Modern Fashion in Detail (Victoria & Albert, £19.95) focuses on the tucks, pleats, buttons and bows of 20th - century style and is even better than a front-row seat at a couture show. Valerie Mendes (the V&A's curator of costume) and Claire Wilcox have assembled a feast of detail from the museum's collections as varied as the shadow - work flowers on a Vionnet scalloped lawn dress (circa 1920) and a metal - springed pocket flap on a Schiaparelli jacket (1936-38 ) to a Katharine Hamnett studded leather jacket (1990).
Richard Davis's close-up photographs are put in perspective with Leonie Davis's line-drawings of the garments. In Vogue : 75 Years of Style (Conde Nast, £25), Georgina Howell's panoramic view of fashion through the decades, proves that politicians, pop stars and the racketings of high society mirror what's in — or out — as much as clothes.
I POETRY I [__ Rober t Nye | The best book of new verse I read in the past year was C.H. Sisson's Antidotes (Carcanet, £6.95). Sisson's poems present you with the movement of a mind that takes nothing for granted, finding plain language and memorable rhythm for its expression: Words fly like birds across the sky, And how they go is also why... It is poetry because it is better than prose. Here is work which will be speaking quietly to new readers when noisier and flashier contemporaries have been forgotten. I also enjoyed Ted Hughes's A Choice of Shakespeare's Verse (Faber, £4.99), approving his selections, and finding him illuminat - ing on the subject of Shakespeare's diction in the thoughtful little essay at the back. One of the best things the Poet Laureate has done.
I GUNS AND GENERALS I I William Jackson | John Strawson's Beggars in Red: The British Army 1789-1889 (Hutchinson , £18.99) is hard to beat in the military field , and is a worthy sequel of his Gentlemen in Khaki, covering 1 890 - 1990 . A great advocate of the regi - mental system, Strawson rubs salt in the wounds being inflicted on it by today's ill-thought through Options for Change. For those who enjoy military biographies, Bernard Freyberg VC: Soldier of Two Nations by his son Paul (Hodder & Stoughton, £30) is an equally good choice, and worth every penny of its price. And perhaps the most important book of all from the political and military historian's viewpoint is From Churchill's Secret Cirde to the BBC (Brassey's, £29.95), Charles Richardson's book on Sir Ian Jacob. It fills substantial gaps in the story of the great wartime inter-Allied conferences, which Jacob attended as Churchill's military secretary.
1 SCIENCE FICTION 1 | Tom Hutchinson Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park (Cen - tury ,£13.99): let me indulge in an ego - binge of satisfaction at successful prophecy. Its story of a dinosaur Disneyworld gone mad was, I forecast, just right for Steven Spielberg . Sure enough, he has completed production. ""They 're breeding!"" may well be the horror catch-phrase for 1992. Multiply - in g , too, over the year were fascinating what-if universes, the most startling
being The Difference Engine by Wil - liam Gibson and Bruce Sterling (Gol - lancz , £13.95), about the industrial revolution come before its time: a fog- j heavy Victorian mix of Frank Harris and Babbage computers. A more Contemporary identity crisis was Dream Science by Thomas Palmer {Harvill, £13.99), in which an in- j surance executive finds himself in a I doorless office, an existence that admits 1 only violence and the fear of being someone else's imaginings: Lewis Carroll crossed with The Night Of The j Living Dead .
\ TRAVEL I I Shona Crawford Poole i Was Patrick Leigh Fermor so pressed j by his publisher for something 1 immediately printable that he dug I Three Letters from the Andes (John I Murray, £10.95) from some forgotten 1 drawer? The suspicion is ungallant, but 1 understandable. He wrote this account 1 of a journey to Peru with six friends 20 J years ago in letters to his wife. The new. I book, so unlike his uncompleted trilogy I that began with A Time of Gifts, is not J about youth recalled in maturity, but a 1 contemporary account unaccountably I postponed. It is also vintage Leigh * Fermor. The journey was a prototype for the style of trekking holiday that is now graded severe. Would that the travelling companions one encounters on such trips today had the charm, swank, erudition, gusto and good humour of Leigh Fermor and his friends . There is no better or more insouciant observer of the bad travel experience; Puno on the shores of Lake Titicaca is a high-altitude lowpointThe 109 pages are indexed; a nice conceit. Gavin Young's good reputation as a travel writer and my liking for Joseph Conrad's novels ensured that I picked up his In Search of Conrad (Hutch in - son , £17.99) with delicious feelings of pleasurable anticipation. I followed Young's modern far eastern journey in archives , libraries and cemeteries, in search of the real people who became Conrad's fictional characters. I paid close attention to the tightly woven tale in order not to get lost somewhere between now and then, fact and fiction. It is seamlessly done but curiously bloodless, not quite here and now or then and there.
I ' ART I I Richard Cork | John Richardson's magisterial biog - raph y of Picasso (Jonathan Cape, £25) dominates the art books this year. Although only the first of a projected four-volume work, taking the story up to 1906, this engrossing achievement already bears the marks of a definitive account . Richardson knew Picasso well in the artist's later years, but there is no trace of sycophancy. On the contrary: the myth of Picasso's boyhood-precocity is firmly demolished, and his un - cer tainty as a young man clearly defined. Richardson has little time for
the Blue period's sentimentality , and is possibly too severe on the chilling symbolism of La Vie. But his frank discussion of Picasso's youthful short - comings makes the eventual arrival at greatness all the more astonishing. By the time this first, hugely readable volume closes, the 25-year-old artist has exorcised the past and begun the Cubist work that would turn modern art inside-out . I await the second instal - ment with impatience.
i CRIME | I Marcel Berlins | The book that lingered longest in the mind was Barbara Vine's King Sol - omon 's Carpet (Viking, £14.99), a haunting, disturbing, exquisitely writ - ten tale of obsession, music and the London Underground. In Birth Marks (Michael Joseph, £13.99) Sarah Du - nant introduced an entirely convincing heroine, Hannah Wolfe, feminine and feminist, intelligent, wickedly witty and totally captivating; and delivered a strong, clever plot as well. Devil in a Blue Dress by Walter Mosley (Ser - p ent 's Tail, £6.99) was the most impressive debut. It is a tough, atmospheric story of Los Angeles in 194 8, with a black private eye operating in neighbourhoods that Philip Marlowe would not have dared to enter.
I GOD i Eric James The C of E Newspaper called Love Unknown: Meditations on the Death and Resurrect ion of Jesus by John Barton, vice-master of St Cross College, Oxford, (SPCK. £4.99) ""exciting and disturbing"". The Methodist Recorder said it was ""a treasure... something of
a masterpiece"". The Tablet called it a ""splendid book"". For me, it is the best book on God in 1991. The Oxford University Press's Past Masters is a superb series of concise, lucid and authoritative introductions to the great thinkers. There could be no better scholar than E.P. Sanders to write the volume on Paul (£4.99). He brings Paul alive as missionary, theologian and religious genius. Bishop Jim Thomp - son 's Stepney Calling (Mowbray, £5.99) concerns his own calling (God recently called him to Bath and Wells), the search for God, the credibility and justice of God, and how we understand His presence. Most chapters were BBC Thoughts for the Day.
COOKING AND EATING I like cookery books that fire me with their words. Recipes set in the aspic of glossy photographs do not have that effect, but act as a barrier between the writer-cook and the reader-cook . Mary Taylor Simeti married and settled in Sicily. Much more than a cook book, Sicilian Food (Century, £16.99) is history, anthropology, literature and travelogue. Chitrita Banerji's life and Food in Bengal (Weidenfeld & Nicol - son , £15.99) is a loving tribute to her homeland and more particularly to its kitchen. She describes the seasons and festivals and the special dishes that are required of each, interwoven, with a delicately told tale of daily life in a Bengali household. Goose Fat and Garlic {Kyle Cathie, £17 .99) is Jeanne Strang's account of her adoptive home in le grand sud-ouest , in which she describes, with an engaging and appro - priately robust vigour, the solid, rustic food of the region and how to cook it.
<NEWPAGE>
MUSIC Pad Griffiths Most of the bicentenary publications vere ephemeral, but not Ivan Nagel's tatonomy and Mercy: .Reflections on Mozart 's Operas {Harvard University » ress, £19.95), whose search for the shape of the operas' characters is arried out with clarity and seriousness [hrough several avenues of historical, literary, dramatic and psychological approach. This is a humane and beautiful little book. Richly stimulating and enquiring, too, are three lectures by Edward W. Said published as Musical Elaborations (Chatto & Windus, £20), a book where music's specialness is intensified by the testing of bridges to other areas of thought: Said is oneof the few wr iters to make it seem important that Beethoven and Jane Austen were contemporaries . Pierre Boulez's Stocktakings from an Apprenticeship {Oxford University Press, £40) is not new. These jibes, japes and brilliant theoretical flourishes date from his twenties and early thirties. But Stephen Walsh's translation at last makes one of the century's key musical books avail - able in strong, supple English.
CLASSICS Peter Jones The most acclaimed academic books are usually large-screen affairs bursting with unexpected stars, locations, and extras rearranged into novel and seduc - tive scenarios. Enormously beguiling at first glance, they tend to wither under close inspection: does this evidence really support that generalisation? More than ever we need our com - mentaries , and Simon Hornblower* s A Commentary on Thucydides, vol 1,
books 1-3 {Clarendon Press, £60) strikes me as a model for anyone who wants to get to grips with that great historian: detailed scholarship com - bined with breadth and lucidity, and the Greek translated into English, too. It is the model on which all future commentaries should be based. Rich - ard Jenkyns's superb Dignity and Decadence {HarperCollins, £20), shows how to orchestrate a wide - ranging argument — the Classical influence upon the art of the apparently Gothic Victorians. Confident general - isations and aesthetic judgments spring persuasively from intensive analysis of evidence (especially the 235 black and white illustrations), and the whole is sustained by enviably elegant and witty writing: scholarly exposition at its very best. Effective persuasion depends on effective psychology, and for the election year ahead, Penguin has cunningly brought out Aristotle's Art of Rhetoric a brilliant exposition of the two (trans - lated by H. Lawson-Tancred , £6.99).
FILM Geoff Brown Who said silent cinema was idle escapism? In Behind the Mask of Innocence Jonathan Cape, £35), Kevin Brownlow lovingly uncovers a mass of American films about poverty, drink, labour strife, prison conditions, Chinks and Wops. It is beautifully illus - trated in the style Brownlow patented 25 years ago in The Parade's Gone By, although you long to see the photos move. More history in The Dilys Powell Film Reader {Carcanet, £25) — 50 years of cinema seen through the wise, witty eyes of the first lady of British film criticism. ""I emerged from Myra Breck - inri dge "", she writes, ""pining for a long
evening with Norma Shearer."" Plus the perfect stocking-filler : Allen Eyles and Keith Skone's London 's West End Cinemas (Keytone, £9.95), a magical, melancholy pictorial guide to the cap - ital 's pleasure domes over 80 years of Renaissance palaces, art deco dreams, and the current multiplex shoeboxes.
I HISTORICAL | PhilippaToomey Two of the best historical novels have the sea as the background: The Nutmeg of Consolation {HarperCollins, £13.99) is Patrick O'Brian 's most recent book on the adventures of that irresistible pair, Captain Jack Aubrey and Dr Stephen Maturin ; and Middle Passage by Charles Johnson {Picador, £14.99), the tale of Rutherford Cal - houn , a freed slave and by nature a con - man , who finds himself aboard a slave ship, sailing from New Orleans to Africa with a crew of misfits and dangerous men. Marvellous...
I CHILDREN I Brian Aldenon Michael Foreman's Mother Goose {Walker Books, £12.99) is a superlative piece of work—a great skein of nursery rhymes strung through a painted landscape that is full of wonderfully executed pictorial jokes. I haven't met with any other new children's book that is so satisfying, although among a hefty crop of anthologies I would like to single out Brian Patten's Puffin Book of Twentieth Century Children's Verse {Puffin, £5.99) — also illustrated by Foreman. Children's fiction -has been pretty drab, but Anne Fine's Book of the Banshee {Hamish \ Hamilton, £8.99) displayed some neat comic ideas.

p ^ li r r ~~l The torrent of verbiage about wine keeps pace with the ever increasing quantities of it made in ever more I unlikely places: and the quality of both I is rather similar. Modern oenological I techniques ensure that very little really I nasty drink escapes from the wineries, I and much of the writing could be I described in like terms: although all one I can ask of cheap wine is that it does not I taste actively disgusting. I I gather from Webstcrs Wine Guide, I by Oz Clarke {Mitchell Beazley, £8.99), I that one supermarket chain sells 15 per I cent of all wine, and that the most popular red is Bulgarian cabernet, f which presumably fulfils the criteria I above. Hugh Johnson's Pocket Wine I Book (Mitchell Beazley, £6.99) and I Websters are annuals — the former I comes across as sensible and bereft of I flannel, and his comments on attempts I to describe wine in words are worth I reading. Clarke's style can fairly be I called histrionic (he is an actor by I origin), and he must eat some pretty I cur ious things, whose flavours are I called in to tell us what is in the bottle. I Websters is very up to date, with I prices and pertinent editorial comment I — champagne shipments, for example. I fell by 50 per cent in the first six months I of this year, as the makers put the price I up and up and are hoping to take £20 a I bottle for non-vintage . f Rosemary George, with Lateral Wine Tasting (Bloomsbury, £16.99), offers I the most ambitious of the three guides, I in which she seeks to make the amateur
bibber taste on in pursuit of wines whose flavour is similar but whose provenance disparate: she is a master of wine, one of a band of experts whose interests seem often to be more con - cerned with the many nuances of the taste of wine rather than its main role as a complement to food. It would be nice to be able to identify wine with the near cer tainty of the professionals, although even they will admit, when pressed, that one look at the label is worth 20 years in the trade. Clarke's New Classic Wines (Mitch - ell Beaztey, £19.99) canters breathlessly round the world with plenty of pretty pictures of people, labels, barrets, maps and vines, which go to make up a large part of any modern book about wine. Clarke states in his introduction that he conceived the book while lying with a man on a Sydney nudist beach. The Winemakers Year, by Michael Buller {Thames & Hudson, £19.95) is a whimsical picture book with a some - what stagey icvd, designed for an American market. The handsome photographs illustrate how much money has been made in Bordeaux in the past 20 years. James Holiday's Wine Atlas of Australia and New Zealand {Harper - Collins , £30) is massive, expensive and full of charts and statistics: a suitable present for the aspiring master of wine. I would prefer to be given The Story of Wine by Hugh Johnson, reissued in paperback (Mitchell Beazley, £6.99), and the only one of the books under review that one would sit down and read for its own sake.

is that they were always there, but the only scholars who knew delib - erately suppressed them. When Dr Thomas Parry published his defin - itive edition of Dafydd ap Gwilym, the greatest Welsh poet, he did not include ""The Penis"" or ""The Poet Sends His Genitals as a Love Messenger"" . So these remained in manuscript (poetry being such a national preoccupation, Welsh medieval poems can exist in as many as 75 versions), and for them printing might have come and gone were it not for one man. The circumstances are as bizarre as everything else in this story. The man who found and translated them translated his own Christian name as well, and the publishing
The most startling thing about this book is that it is not a hoax. The poems exist and have existed for 500 years, far filthier than anything by English contemporaries like Chaucer, filth - ier than Rochester even, and with - ou t his snigger. They were written by the roaring boys and one roaring girl in the Welsh Middle Ages, and written in the most elaborate metre of which the oldest vernacular literature in Europe was capable. So these are doubly worrying, being not only filthy but little works of art, and by now the possibility of quotation could be inducing an attack of the vapours in the literary editor of this newspaper. But where, in a country where the first description of sexual inter - course in a novel in the Sixties caused a national outcry, have the poems been until now? The answer
MEDIEVAL WELSH EROTIC POETRY Edited and translated by Dafydd Jonston Tafol , £8.95 house was formed by him and his wife for the sole purpose of printing the poems. Dafydd Jonston, lecturer in Welsh in Cardiff, began life as an Englishman called David Johnston. Yet why should so many Welsh poets have written erotic verse? They have always been seen as an intensely conservative force, serv - ing long apprenticeships which would allow them to write in the old forms and, by praising their patrons,
upholding the social order. The answer is that erotica was a release from this. It allowed them to play. It allowed Dafydd ap Gwilym to mock the poetic convention of sending a messenger, usually a bird, to one's love. Dafydd sends his complete genitalia (""Be you fierce/my bald round love mes - sengers "" ). Some poems are satires on such European conventions as courtly love, with its pale ladies. The women here are far randier than the men (""The playful beauty gets cross/And calls out 'Hey , to bed you ape'.""), and even long before any secular work by a woman in English there is poetry by a 15 th century Welsh woman, Gwerful Mechain, who addresses an affec -
tionate poem to the female pu - denda . She is quite extraordinary, far more extreme than any modern feminist, and there is not a line of her poetry that can be quoted here. Almost every poem is a counter - part to the norm, which suggests that the erotic was an accepted medieval genre in Wales. Poets appear to have enjoyed themselves before the shadow of the chapels fell, but the irony is that not only were these poems forgotten but so was the detailed physical language used, so that Jonston could only guess at the meaning of some words. There has never been a book quite like this. If you were writing a satire on a race this would be a perfect opening chapter, for it involves the complete reappraisal of a national character. At his wife's request, Jonston did not dedicate the book to her.

Dabbing on the sweet smell of success
S heila Pickles is a perfumier whose nose is more often buried in a book of poetry than a scent bottle. Ms Pickles is the head of Penhali - gon 's, the gentlemen 's perfumiers she salvaged from extinction in 1975 and has developed into an international empire. She is pas - sionate about poetry, and loves the whiff of the leather-bound books she inherited from her grandmother — believed to be the first woman to read classics at London university — almost as much as their contents.
The same romanticism has driven Ms Pickles to preserve and develop the legacy of design she acquired in 1975, when she bought what remained of the barber shop established by William Henry Penhaligon in London in 1870. By the time Ms Pickles stepped in, the Penhaligon 's shop in Bury Street, St James's, had gone. All that was left was a collection of old labels, eight formula books, eight products (four of which were hair - d ressing lotions) and the goodwill of a dwindling list of loyal custom - ers which had once included Noel Coward, Gertrude Lawrence and the Duke of Edinburgh. The film director Franco Zeffirelli, for whom Ms Pickles had worked in Rome for five years, and with whom she had shopped at Pen - haligon 's original St James's shop on visits to London , prompted her to try to resuscitate the business. She started up with just three colognes — Hammam Bouquet, Blenheim Bouquet and Penhali -
gon s eau-de-Cologne . By then, English Fern was made only as a bath essence , and she abandoned the hair products. ""I knew nothing about the perfumery business ,"" she says. ""I went into it with this odd mix of ignorance and ar - rogance . But I never had any doubt I would succeed. I am a Scorpio. Failure just does not come into it."" The formulae she inherited clearly had a cult following, es - pecially Hammam , the spicy mix of sandalwood, jasmine and attar of rose created in 1872 and named after the St James's Turkish baths. Hammam Bouquet, the most ex - pe n sive of Penhaligon's men's f ra - gra nces , costs £32 for 100ml of aftershave, £26 for 50ml eau de toilette spray , and £70 for 30ml
extract . But Ms Pickles takes the greatest pleasure in the vintage Victorian labels, with their clean - cut script, and the more flowery Edwardian designs whose orig - inals are framed on her office walls and which are recreated to incor - po rate all the blurb required on perfumery products these days. ""Dermaline contains no perfume whatsoever"" she reads with relish from one of William Henry's obsolete labels. Penhaligon's, for Ms Pickles, is a select international club of cognoscenti, mostly men, who come to buy traditional colognes and balms in vintage packaging. She moved into Covent Garden in 1975 , as the apple carts in the market pulled out, opening her first Penhaligon's shop in Welling -
ton Street. The Dickensian an- is carefully cultivated, with mahog - a ny display cabinets and an old brass bell to punch for attention. Today it is the showcase shop in a chain of four in London, with branches in Bath, Chester and York and a corner in Bergdorf Goodman in New York. The bottle design is authentic. When Ms Pickles took on the company, flat rectangular stoppers were in use, sealed with a loop of velvet ribbon. In 1977 William Henry 's great-granddaughter , Re - nee Gold, materialised with an original bottle, and the ball stop - per was reinstated.
The success of Penhali - gon 's, Ms Pickles be - lieves , is based on a triangular relationship between her ""nose"" (the perfumier with whom she develops the formula of a scent), the designer of the packaging , and herself. All three, have been in action recently to create Cornubia, the latest Pen - haligon ' s fragrance and the first specifically created for women. ""I wanted an evening scent that was exotic and mysterious but not vulgar or too punchy,"" she says. The result is a combination of clove and coriander , with Egyp - tian violet leaves and Moroccan and Turkish roses , on a base of vanilla, sandalwood and vetyver. Madeleine Bennett, when she was at Michael Peters, the design company , worked with Ms Pickles on the distinctive Penhaligon's design formula we recognise to -
day . The design of Cornubia, however, is the work of Flo Bayley, her current consultant, who has turned the name on its side and embossed it on gold. The familiar Penhaligon's bottle is dressed in a star-studded purple box and has a fat gold bow at its neck. Cornubia goes on sale in September, the eau de toilette priced from £25 for 30ml, and the full-strength extract £60 for 30ml. The scents may be packaged to look as though they have been brewed at the back of the shop but they are produced in Penhaligon's high-technology headquarters in north London. Ms Pickles takes no notice of trends in the trade. ""I listen to my customers,"" she says. She is surprised to be asked how Penhaligon's products are tested. ""What do you mean, tested? I wear it. My sister wears it. My husband always says proudly that his is the head on which Bluebell shampoo was tested."" In 1987 she decided she needed a partner to support her plans for
international expansion. Laura Ashley , another company built on the nostalgic vision of one woman, stepped in and bought Penhali - gon ' s , leaving Ms Pickles to do what she enjoys best, thinking up new products. A year ago, when Laura Ashley's own business be - gan to falter, it had to shed Pen - haligon 's. The Limited, the Amer - ican mail order and stores chain, took over the company for $12.8 million. Leslie Wexner , the head
of The Limited , is a Penhaligon's customer of many years. ""He is my knight in shining armour ,"" Ms Pickles says. Penhaligon's range has expanded to include scented candles, room sprays and pot-pourri , as well as bristle brushes, shaving soap bowls and scent bottles in gilded silver and enamel. A range of grooming ""requisites"", packaged in navy or burgundy leather and in a choice of mock ivory , nickel , slate, chrome, and silver plate, has been launched . A grooming-kit roll costs £95; the smaller 48-hour kit pictured is £65. There are . also Penhaligon's books, anthologies of poetry, - prose and diary snippets on the Grand Tour, summer, Christmas, flowers and love. Each costs £12.95 and there are a million in print. She has been asked to do a book on scent, but turned it down: ""I find all those engravings of 17 th century Frenchmen in gauntlets and endless pictures of lavender fields in Norfolk deeply boring.""

Dante's Inferno, xv, 121-4 Poi si rivolse, e parve di coloro che corrono a Verona il drappo verde per la campagna; e parve di costoro quegli che vince e non colui che perde ""Then he turned back, and seemed like one of those who run the cross - co untry race at Verona for the prize of green cloth; and he seemed like the winner, not a loser."" Down in the seventh circle of Hell, second zone, Dante meets the sodomites, eternally crossing burning sands beneath a rain of fire. One of them is Brunetto Taring his old tutor, for whom he feels gratitude and love. The passage is inspired by Aeneas's meeting with Deiphobus in hell: Brunetto's burnt face corresponds to the mutilation of Deiphobus. European poetry is a great federation down the centuries, continually echoing and bouncing off its predecessors. As usual , Dante elaborates the scene , and heightens the pathos. The two friends reminisce, and Brunetto warns Dante about his coming exile from beloved Florence. It is a hellish bleak background, as they contemplate their separate eternities, but their meeting has brightness and beauty. Then time is up, and Brunetto sprints back to bis fires, as though he can't wait to be back. I think there is a note of hope and victory there. Poetry is the bit that gets lost in translation.

ALFRED, LORD TENNYSON from The Princess: A Medley, 1847 Now sleeps the crimson petal, now the white; Nor waves the cypress in the palace walk; Nor winks the gold fin in the porphyry font; The fire-fly wakens: waken thou with me. Now droops the milk-white peacock like a ghost. And like a ghost she glimmers on to me. Now lies the Earth all Danae to the stars. And all thy heart lies open unto me. Now slides the silent meteor on, and leaves A shining furrow, as thy thoughts in me. Now folds the lily all her sweetness up, And slips into the bosom of the lake; So fold thyself, my dearest, thou, and slip Into my bosom and be lost in me.
IN THE way that many paintings tell a story, if you look with a questioning eye, some poems paint a picture. Turner and his contemporaries considered poetry and painting to be joint arts. Poetry did the movement , painting the colours. It is the colours, from crimson to that milk-white peacock, most poetic of birds since Byzantine iconography made it the immortal bird, that paint the picture in one of the finest lyrics in English. The Danae couplet is one of the incantatory spells of love poetry, high romance without slipping into sentimental - ity . The Princess is an extraordinary mixture of haunting lyrics, and rum but compelling narrative, set partly at a high Victorian garden party, and partly in the days when knights were bold, expressing the growing Victorian concerns with geology, astronomy, mathematics, evolutionary theory, feminism, domesticity , and paternalism. It envisages a future in which, ""The man [may] be more of woman, she of man"" . It is , in part, a brave, early feminist trumpet blast. Tennyson wrote of it to his friend Edward Rubaiyat Fitzgerald, ""I hate it and so will you "", and subjected it to considerable revision. It formed the basis of Gilbert and Sullivan's send-up , Princess Ida. But the whole thing is worth a revisit, and not just for those magical lyrical spells.

They may all sound very self-indulgent , or even whimsical, but Rothschild is, in fact, a scientist; there is a clarity and objectivity here which precludes the vagaries of literary sentimentality. Yet there is also a larger theme, and in many respects this is a consideration of the way in which all natural things are conceived in harmony with one another. That is why these winged creatures can be seen to represent the state of man; in Rothschild 's account the moth evokes solitude and disaffection, its attraction for the flame like some unendurable human longing , while the butterfly in many myths embod - ies the escape of the soul from the cage or chrysalis of the body. Through the pages of this book, as a result, butterflies are seen to be curiously and almost literally spell - binding creatures, their strange ""transmigrations"" of form, as Sir Thomas Browne put it, touching within us some deep fascination for the possibilities of change and rebirth.

Rothschild 's account of the silk - moth caterpillar conveys that same sense of mystery, as the technical analysis of its manufacturing pro - cess is followed by a quotation from William Blake. Perhaps this is fanciful but, then again, perhaps not : scientists who read and under - stand Blake might well be better scientists. Nobody has claimed that Lucretius or Thomson were inferior poets simply because they assimi - lated contemporary scientific theory, or that Vladimir Nabokov was a worse novelist just because he was also an entomologist So why should scientists not also be poets? V arious disciplines are brought together, and that is the point of the book. Of course, there are very few writers who combine grace of style with carefulness of natural observation — Nabokov is one and so, too, is Marcel Proust, described here as ""the first and greatest urban natu -
ralis t the world has ever known"". Rothschild has something of the same strength, but the success of her graceful book suggests the larger question. Is there any way now that science and literature can be rec - onciled , as they were, for example, in the previous century? Darwin and Faraday wrote to be understood by an audience larger than their immediate colleagues, and Darwin is closer to Dickens than to Lin - naeus . But how can such a reconcili - ation be achieved now? Can it only be done in the lyrical and mellif - luous way that Rothschild chooses here — science as poetry — or is there some stronger, formal bond to be discovered? No doubt, cultural historians of the next century will recognise such connections, and it will then be shown how contem - porary scientific theory emerges from the same principles that animate contemporary fiction or contemporary painting. Perhaps all of this, in the context of Butterfly Cooing Like A Dove, is to break the very same butterfly upon an iron wheel — the creature which, as the scientist knows, secretes ""an aromatic substance, a pyrazine "", which may be defensive",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0503278414/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=3383b83c

The popular song, according to one authority cited in this history, ""is American culture"". Of course, this depends on what is meant by culture. In European soci - e t ies , popular music tends to become more respectable as it recedes into the past. If it is very old indeed, it is treated as poetry, as practically all Elizabethan songs now are: many people might pretend to admire a medieval ballad while at the same time managing to despise a contemporary pop song with practically the same words and senti - ments . It is a simple matter of literary snobbery. And those who find titles such as From This Moment On or Day In—Day Out trite might care to ponder such tunes from the 16th century as Dissembling Love, New New Nothing or Saturday Night and Sunday Morn. The situation is different in America, and for good reasons. A society that prides itself upon being democratic will take much more interest in popular art forms as such, and there is in any case no doubt that Tin Pan Alley (by which term Philip Furia here associates the work of lyricists as different as Irving Berlin and Oscar Hammerstein ) pro - duced in the Twenties and Thirties writing as skilful and as effective as anything then emerging from what is often called ""high culture"". Not that American lyricists them - selves seem to have realised that fact and, as Furia suggests here, they tend to be variously embarrassed or dis parag - ing about their particular art. Many seem to have come to the Eliotic conclusion that the words do not matter, and are merely the adjunct to an interesting melody. As Ira Gershwin expressed it in the preface to a collection of his own lyrics: ""Any resemblance to actual poetry, living or dead, is highly improbable ."" Highly improbable , but certainly not impos - sible ; he may not be Wyatt, or even
The popular lyrics of Tin Pan Alley's best songwriters will outlive the works of many serious poets, Peter Ackroyd writes

were an influence upon the work of such ""serious"" poets as Auden or - Eliot The ca -
20 th century . And that is the oblique point Furia makes throughout this volume: he is sensible enough to treat the lyrics for what they are, expert and graceful attempts to find the expressive face of a melody, and learned enough to make cultural comparisons on a grand scale. In fact, his frequent allusions to the work of e.e. cummings, William Carlos Williams and Mari - anne Moore only serve forcibly to suggest that the poetry of Cole Porter or Johnny Mercer will be sung long after that of Moore, for example , has been forgotten . N evertheless , on the evidence collected here, most Ameri - can lyricists are altogether insecure about their art and their position; many of them emphasise the fact that the best songs took only IS or 20 minutes to write, while others are at pains to suggest the improvisatory nature of their activity. This surely does not disqualify them from being artists , however, many famous poems and paintings have been produced with even less effort , and only the latent Puritanism of the American character could disqualify the work of men (and a few women) who spent a lifetime shaping the right words to the right melody. As a result many of the lyrics seem as witty and as poignant now as they did when they were first written, and it should not be forgotten that they
dences and phrases of these lyricists have found an enduring place in the literary culture of America: not just in the way that the ""pop art"" of the Sixties wilfully embraced commercial im - agery , but because the popular song addresses a deep need in the American spirit for colloquial force and vernacu - lar rhythm . Furia explains this better than any abstract disquisition when he lists such popular titles as / Guess I'll Have To Change My Plan, How Long Has This Been Going On?, Just One Of Those Things, I Should Care and From This Moment On. Cheap music is potent, not because it is cheap at all, but because it can create an immediate mood and, as a result of that immediacy, can conjure up the very conditions of the world (both private and public) in which it was composed . It relates to a specific time, and even a specific place ; as a result , it preserves them for ever. However, it is also important to see these lyrics on their own terms, as expressive and frequently ingenious attempts to shape words around music, so that the strict demands of what is generally an eight-bar unit are aligned with the melodic imperatives of the lyrics themselves. It is an artificial art, in other words, and that in the best possible sense — a sense which the Elizabethans , as the last great genera - tion of popular lyricists, would have understood very well. So let us now
praise some famous New York poets — Irving Berlin, one of the great geniuses of American music, who worked his way to the top. He began as ""plugger"" of sheet music and singing waiter to become an absolute master of the popular song — whether it be in his earliest success, Alexander's Ragtime Band, or in later and more nostalgic lyrics such as What'HIDo ?ot As Time Goes By. F uria also charts the history of those who followed — among them Lorenz Hart , who first combined ""society verse and popular song "", and Ira Gershwin, who helped bring the song lyric into adulthood after a prolonged period of romantic adolescence. But it is Cole Porter who more than anyone seems to embody the sophistication songwriters are thought to represent (and which mod - ern songwriters, justly or unjustly , seem to have inherited): this may be a confusion between the writer and the singer, however, with the popular conception of the lyricist as a sort of literary Fred Astaire. Nevertheless Por ter's decline after a riding ^ accident heralded the return of a more primitive chromaticism, a lyric dark age in which Oscar Hammerstein was the only fitful light Yet there had been between the wars what Furia calls here a ""golden age "". In that period American songs achieved a greatness which can properly be com - pared to that of the Elizabethan era — or, if that sounds too grandiose , at least to the tradition of the 18th-century street ballad. Such works achieve a kind of immortality because they manage effor tlessly to convey the atmosphere of a lost period, while at the same time expressing sentiments that are readily identifiable across the centuries . That was the real achieve- - ment of Tin Pan Alley.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0501845158/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=d1323813

You may well think that no great poetry is being written today. I could not possibly comment, except to observe that great poets come as single spies, not in battalions, unless you are lucky enough to be born a contemporary of Ovid, or Marlowe, or Tennyson, or maybe, pushing it a bit, Eliot And the single spies come in
unexpected disguises, and are not immediately recognised. His contem - poraries tended to think of the young Shakespeare as a ranting show-off and candidate for Pseud's Corner. Poets are not very useful, because they are not consumeful or very produceful. In one little-noticed field great poetry is still being turned out today; and that is in the field of translation. All great classics need to be continually retranslated, to keep up with the shifting tides of language and scholar - ship , and the new concerns of a new generation. A great work of literature interacts with its translations, which are its footnotes and children down the centuries . Homer sets Virgil off on to his Italian Odyssey and Iliad, and their epics ripple through the work of subsequent poets from Milton to Tennyson to Joyce. Our modern translations are the forgotten army of the great poetry being written today. They are the best translations (even, to an extent, for understanding such maligned works as The New English Bible), because they are written for us
now, and crown the works that have gone before. It is a field in which our generation excels. Today we get David West's new translation of the Aeneid, for which we have waited as long as Odysseus dallied on Calypso's island , and with as much agreeable impatience. He has trans - lated it into prose, partly because he says he is no poet (not strictly true), and partly because nobody reads things that are set out as long narrative poems any more. But set it out how you like, this deploys the power and music and range of contemporary English prose in an unobtrusively poetic way. The single spy has slipped past you unnoticed . West is an ace at the rhetorical device called polyptoton, repeating the same word in a different case or inflexion — a kind of grammatical rhyme. Virgil was also fond of the trick,
but West uses it on occasions where Virgil did not, to convey an effect in heavily inflected Latin that cannot be turned into almost uninflected English. It is the most truthful translation ever, conveying as many nuances and whispers as are possible from the original. This is a highly rhetorical version of an intensely rhetorical poem. Recent commentary has seen the Aeneid as a subversive samizdat protest against the brutalities of Augus - tan imperialism. This suits the anti - imperialist interests of our generation. Westxestores the Aeneid to its original purpose as a panegyric in praise of Virgil's patron, the ruler of Rome, although I think he skates over some of the darker undertones beneath the praise rather lightly. He turns the spotlight on bit players, whose characters Virgil caught for all eternity in a snatch of dialogue , or a description of movement. The Sibyl is

Aeneas and his faithful friend Achates explore, and observe the Tyrians hard at work building their new city of Carthage. In the middle there is a huge temple, decorated with pictures of the Trojan war, whose story has already flown around the world. Aeneas: ""Look , there 's Priam. Even here heroes are recognised . Ther e are tears shed for things even here, and mortality touches the heart"" That is literal. I said it was untranslatable. Sunt lacrimae rerum et mentem mortalia tangunt. Take it
Knight ""There is pity for a world's distress and a sympathy for short-lived humanity."" Distress and sympathy, forsooth. West ""Here too there is just reward for merit, there are tears for suffering and men's hearts are touched by what man has to bear."" Note that old polyptoton, with men and man, not in the Latin, but taking the place of the Latin alliteration. West's is the sim - plest , the closest to Virgil, and (for Venus's sake don't tell anyone) the most poetic. For our time, this is the best version of the stateliest measure ever moulded by the lips of man: ""All the charm of all the Muses often flowering in a lonely word ."" If marooned on a desert island, and invited to take along only one series of books, the stylish choice is the Penguin Classics , which give the treasures of western literature in lively modern English. The series was founded in
1946 by EV. Rieu, with his translation of The Odyssey, which has been in print ever since. It is a grand old war - horse , saying Ha ha among the trumpets, but it is showing signs of age. Here it is, brought up to date by Rieu's son, a retired headmaster. Rieu's purple patches have been toned down to modem taste; Homer's formulaic epithets
have been restored in place of Rieu's inelegant variations; Rieu's Victorian courtesies , never addressing anybody without a ""Please be good enough to"", have been adapted to modern man - ners . Peter Jones has written a stimulating and punchy modern in - tr oduction , including a chronological skeleton of the story (I have never seen this done before), showing the complexity and ingenuity of the second work of western literature. The Koran, translated by Nessim Dawood, is another winged horse of the Penguin Classics. Since it was first published in 19S6, it has sold more than a million copies, and never been out of print Here comes the fifth edition, heavily revised to keep the English up to date. Dawood was born in Baghdad, came to England as an Iraq state scholar, and graduated from London University. His is the only version, if you want to know in English what the Koran actually says, behind the thunder of the faith and fanaticism
and the poetry. Basic changes for the new edition include ""God"" instead of ""Allah"" , ""Lord of the Universe"" instead of ""Lord of the Creation"", and ""alms levy"" instead of ""alms tax"". For this celebratory edition, an index has been added, and also a parallel calligraphic version of the Arabic original in the inside top corner of each page, follow - ing the traditional arrangement of the surahs. This contemporary but poetic version is essential reading for any non-Muslim who wants to understand our modern world, and its gnarled ancient roots.
The Theaetetus is another foundation document of west - ern civilisation, one of the most poetic and philosophically rigorous of all the dialogues. Socrates applies his gadfly question to the meaning of knowledge, and makes his famous comparison of himself to a midwife, who brings to birth the thoughts of others . In it Plato explicitly abandoned narrated dialogue as cumbrous, and wrote bis argument like the text of a play. It is a great dialogue, but it is not easy, which is why we have been arguing about it ever since; and in the past they put undergraduates to easier texts. Myles Burnyeat, the Laurence Professor of Ancient History at Cam - bridge , has revised Levett's translation to catch the charm and wit of the original in modern English , and has written a magnificent introduction and commentary of 250 pages that is lucid, rigorous , fair and un-put-downable , even for the amateur. Here are four masterworks of lit - erature , brought to life again by the art and high poetry of our modern translators . The greatest poetry of the year. Anybody who does not read them is missing some of the best things in life.

COLLECTED POEMS By Donald Davie Carcanet, £25 AGYUKA O SOL?/ EAGLE OR SUN? By Octavio Paz, translated by Eliot Weinberger Peter Owen, £11.95 THE LITERARY REVIEW ANTHOLOGY OF REAL POETRY Edited and introduced by Auberon Waugh Ashford, Buchan. & Enright, £6.95 D onald Davie is a man of many parts, but do any of those parts add up to a poet? He is a sound and a generous critic, perhaps the only one to have written sensibly about Thomas Hardy and Ezra Pound, figures usually held poles apart by their various admirers. A mind this tolerant and eclectic must have made him a good teacher in those years when he had employment enlivening the Eng - lish departments of universities here and in America. Poetry and criticism have always gone hand in hand for him, ever since he published his first book, Purity of Diction in English Verse, nearly 40 years ago, though it would be unfair to make too much of the fact that he was thus declaring his critical predilections even before he had appeared before the public as a poet. For my part, I would record a small debt of gratitude for his Augustan Lyric (1974), a book which opened my eyes to the hymns of Watts and Wesley being poems. Davie's heart is in that book. The same elusive article is to be found in his Collected Poems, but you will have to look hard for it and be prepared to put up with prolixity as the price for occasional purity. I dared occasion , and came off intact, Unharmed, not therefore ashamed. The act Is unimportant; and the times I fell In fact, in thought, in wish, in all but ' will, Reflect how little credit falls to me, At fault just there, in will's discovery. This is Davie at his finest, meaning every word that he says, and putting those words together with much skill. The poem is the third of three very early ""Moral Discoveries""; its determ - ination to extract meaning from experience might be grim, like a man trying to pull out his own teeth, but the exercise is impressive. There are enough things like this, at every stage of Davie's progress, to make the volume worthwhile, though I think it has to be said that he has written too much for the good of his own talents, with a result that there is a conspicuous lack of pressure in such sequences as ""The Shires"", a tourist trot through the counties of England, and ""To Scorch or Freeze"", a lot of poems about Davie's
non-conformist conscience which are just tepid. Still, some of the more recent work holds out real promise that Davie's old age might see a return to the restraint which enriched his poetic capacity in earlier days. ""Sounds of a Devon Village"" is lovely, and ""Equestrian Sestina"" very clever and satisfying, not just in technique but in celebrating its subject by attention to detail. Davie, artificer, civil puritan, could be, on this evi - dence , the most promising old poet that we have. Octavio Paz is an interesting figure, philosopher as well as poet, one of those savants who seem more at home in Latin cultures than in our own. Born in Mexico City in 1914, he has published many volumes of verse and prose, and has been a diplomat as well as a writer. He was awarded the most recent Nobel prize for literature. A reader without Spanish might well wonder ""why?"", especially when con - fronted by the latest volume of Paz's work to appear in English, Eagle or Sun? Perhaps it is Eliot Weinberger's fault that these prose poems seem
confused, and in fairness I must point out that at least this is a bilingual edition, so those able to read the original will be free to draw their own conclusions. The title refers to the two emblems on either side of the Mexican peso, implying duality, and there is a deal of stuff in here about Mexico's pre-Columbian past, the nastiness of the modern world, the Aztec proph - ecies of doom. The goddess Itzpapalotl gets the best lines. This is appealing, but small beer as visions go. ""/ was the mountain that creates you as it dreams, the house of fire, the primordial pot where man is cooked and becomes man."" This sounds to me like the afternoon nap of a chap who has been reading Levi-Strauss , rather than the illumination of a Rimbaud. I confess to wondering if Paz is less a visionary than a man who would like to see things. Does modern poetry have to be
obscure? Auberon Waugh has been waging a campaign in his Literary Review on behalf of the idea that it does not, organising a compe - tition for ""poems that rhyme , scan, and make sense"" . The Literary Review Anthology of Real Poetry prints what he assures us are the best 130 of these efforts. I can only say that I trust this is one of Waugh's little jokes, since the book is as dreary a heap of steaming doggerel as you are likely to encounter in centuries. It is one thing to wonder if Modernism has run its course, and to hope that English poetry might find refreshment in a return to source and a judicious use of rhyme and metre. It is quite another to pretend that this can be achieved by encouraging the production of verses that for sheer brainlessness would embarrass Winnie the Pooh. Waugh should know better; and does.

Norman Cameron's Collected Poems (Anvil, £14.95) is the book I enjoyed most this year, and one that will go on being enjoyed as long as there are readers left to discover the real thing for themselves . This is poetry not as verbal decoration , but as a way of truth, words pressed plainly into memorable form by a heart that thinks for itself . Witness one confessional quatrain : Forgive me, Sire, for cheating your intent, That I, who should command a regiment , Do amble amiably here, O God, One of the neat ones in your awkward squad That gives the flavour in miniature , but the book should be experienced as a whole : it is all of a piece , and there is scarcely a bad line in it Cameron, neglected in his lifetime, comes from the volume as that rarity — a modern poet not ashamed to be inspired, or understood.

Poetry m song
0 THE last time the baritone Thomas Allen appeared in this space, he was high on Butterworth's idle hill of sum - mer . Now Virgin Classics has moved him on to Brahms's Mittel Europa for a disc of songs inspired by German and Austrian poets and the verse of Bohemia and Hungary. This is quite the best thing Allen has done for Virgin. The immediate world of each song is lived in to the full, as the voice rides the full distance of Brahnis's melodies, basks, in their harmonic warmth and tests their rhythmic muscle. Focus is sharper here than it was in his earlier Schumann disc. Whether in the con - fidences of ""Wir Wandelten"", nicely poised between curios - ity and secrecy, or in the exploitation of deep reservoirs of breath, Allen grips the attention. The programming, too, is sensible: continuity and contrast are shrewdly balanced. Geoffrey Parsons supports

Allen imaginatively at the piano, whether in the loose - limbed interplay of right and left hand in ""Wir wandelten"" or in realising the Bohemian dance which pulses behind the folksong. It is Parsons , too, who gives added ballast and breadth to the singing of Glaf Bar in their latest release of Schubert's Schwanengesang. The German baritone's voice is younger, lighter and, as yet, less muscular than Allen's. It does not take kindly to strain: this disc was made a year ago , before Bar's recent summer of indisposition, and it points the distinctive qual -
ities of this particular stage in its growth. Its long, warm lines effort - lessly shape certain songs, but are reluctant to bite deep into the rhythms of ""Aufenthalt"" . There is, though, a new sense of concentration, a greater dimension of strength already showing in Bar's handling of the darker Heine songs. He finds a real alter ego of anguish for ""Der Doppelganger"", and is the equal in stature, if not yet in deepest pitch, for the world-carrying ""Der Atlas"" . Recent musicological disco - veries have underlined the fact that Mahler's piano - accompa -
nied songs are by no means to be considered mere prelimi - naries to his later orchestral versions. Brigitte Fassbaender and Thomas Moser's record - ing of the piano version of-Das lied von der Erde (Teldec 2292 46276-2 ) was revelatory. Sieg - fried Jerusalem's new release of the Riickert Lieder and songs from Des Knaben Wunderhorn is an equally strong advocate of the more familiar piano versions of these songs, thanks to Sieg - fried Mauser's strongly de - fined accompanying. Jerusalem, highly sought after as an operatic helden - tenor , is at his best in the larger-scale , more overtly dra - matic songs. The four "" sol - dier "" ballads from Des Knaben Wunderhorn are re - freshingly bluff and coarse - textured , and the full scope of his tenor recreates the dark night of Mahler's musical soul in Ruckhert's midnight songs.

How to make lip contact with the famous: Fiona MacCarthy on one of Britain's leading works of fiction
YOU'VE HAD YOUR TIME Being the Second Part of the Confessions of Anthony Burgess Heinemann, £17.50
In one of many boastful mo - ments in this book, Burgess tells us he knows the whole of Gerard Manley Hopkins by heart. Also much of Marvell, a great many of Pound's Cantos, most of T. S. Eliot, and the lyrics of Lorenz Hart and Cole Porter. Given smallest encouragement, Burgess would no doubt sing them. This is, after all, the man who celebrated Shake - speare 's quatercentenary by pub - licl y reciting Shakespeare in Elizabethan phonemes to a dis - gusted audience, who would have preferred John Gielgud. What is nice about Burgess is the lunatic pretension, the preposterous naivety that spews out into this latest volume of his memories with even less self-checking than there was in volume one. Who but Burgess would label these memoirs his Confessions , emulating St Augustine and Jean-Jacques Rous - seau ? He refers to his book as ""a time-bound account of a life which has not been spent wholly in time"" . This might mean almost anything. I
take it to refer to those hours spent at the censorship conference in New York in a .death-like coma from which he was revived with quarts of Coca-Cola . Nothing succeeds for Burgess like excess. It is 1960 when these memoirs open. Burgess is unhappily married in chill Hove, drinking as though he and his wife were still sweltering under a ceiling fan in the tropical climes they have just left. Lynne's main failing, according to the man who has not only written a book on D. H. Lawrence but also set four D. H. Lawrence poems to music, was her lack of ""Dionysian ecstasy"" . Or could it have been simply that she always cooked in lard? One of Burgess's tenets is that women have an inborn sense of duplicity. But what, in volume one, about Burgess himself quietly learn - ing about aromatic sex while pretending to be running a literary and debating society in Malay College? And what is one to make,
in this episode, of Burgess's amaz - ing predilection for evasion and disguises, turning himself into Visit - ing Fellow of Creative Writing at Princeton, Distinguished Professor at City College of New York. Burgess travels, in his own words, ""far , wide and crazily"". He only feels at home in the Bedford Dormobile. But his book tells tales of vacances of disaster and embarrassment, the most desperate of which features Burgess distributing polyester shift dresses, purchased in Marks & Spencer, Tunbridge Wells, in the vestibule of the Astoria Hotel, Leningrad. He chooses a crimson dress to give the scarlet woman (discernible even in Russia, he assures us). The moral is never to go on holiday with men who do not like Jane Austen. Burgess has the knack of turning holidays to farce. It is that sense of sin. The work ethic and the agonies of sexual ambivalence: Burgess's Catholic
inheritance pervades these mem - oirs . His horror of idleness drives him to work at ten times the pace of any normal writer. This drowns him in the guilt of indefatigability. Is he squandering his talents as he writes on Yves St Laurent? Is he too much in the paws of producers and directors? He describes his inability to turn work down in terms of surren - dering to the temptations of the harlot Burgess knows he is not the man for the James Bond script, but ""a horrid fascination drove me on"" . He is very edgy. He takes up a lot of space reviewing the reviewers of the Burgess opus, ridiculing those
critics not totally approving, and particularly caustic about women who tend to object to all the sound and the scatology. I suppose this is the answer to his wife's infuriating chanting ""Mr Burgess disappoints"" . But some of the strictures about sticking to the subject come oddly from a reviewer who writes so very brilliantly about almost everything except the book in question. Review - ing does not necessarily entail reading, as Burgess himself warned us in Confessions volume one. There must be a verb ""to bur - gess "", which being translated crudely means lip contact with the famous. Connoisseurs of Burgess's
reviews will know how often he infiltrates socially mobile kissing into them, under the watchful eye of his literary editors. This book could be subtitled the beginner's guide to burgessing. The air fills up with kisses as Burgess becomes successful and well-known and more Hollywood in manner. He embraces the ""elegantly ageing"" Paulette Goddard. Later on he describes himself as going all the way from Cesena to Scanno to kiss Monica Villi. His recollected hug with Mary Ure is eerie. Ure, says Burgess slightly smugly, ""did not long survive my kiss"" .
Is Burgess fact or fiction? This has always been a puzzle. Except for explaining how he is and is not Enderby, Burgess in this volume gives his readers scant enli ghten - ment . One cannot, for example, totally believe in his second and absurdly happy marriage. Does the real-life son of a pub-keeper from Moss Side end up in the land of Un Aranciaio Orologeria in a stupen - dous letto matrimoniale, of the deep wide kind in which the wives of mafia bosses dictate midnight pol - icy , with a beautiful young intellec - tual Italian aristocrat? A wife, moreover, who shares Burgess's
philosophy of beds: that they are meant not to be made but to be unmade. Burgess, the puritan, is tormented by his luck. What makes Burgess such a tense and odd and interesting writer is that conflict between his craving for belonging and his resentment of the sources of his plaudits. He claims to be irrevocably unEnglish. But there is something wonderfully, comically English about his Muggeridgean urge to bite the hand that feeds him. Burgess copies the demean - our of the international genius while retaining the whiff of the Workers' Educational Association.
<NEWPAGE>
Burgess is a near-miss genius. These Confessions are not perfect. They are less good than the last ones: too long and too repetitive. The Borges/Burgess dialogue in living Anglo-Saxon wilts at a second telling. Antonio Borghese, "" friend - ly , even hospitable, but inseducible"" (even in Iowa), is not as compelling as the old-time Burgess in the borderland of the erotic flicker. But nobody has ever written so convincingly on those strange inner compulsions of the writer, and no one can compete with that mad bad Bur - gess language. This book shows that he is still the wizard of the word.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0500328044/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=b49138b9

A NEW TREASURY OF POETRY Selected and introduced by Neil Philip Illustrated by John Lawrence BlacHe,£14.95
M aking anthologies is like composing music with other men's tunes. The important thing may seem to be
how many varied tunes the antholo - gist knows, but the craft lies in turning them into a shapely whole — a poem made out of poems. Such a definition needs empha - sising , particularly where antho - logies for children are concerned. Only rarely are we fortunate enough to be offered a richly composed work like this one, which subordi - nates everything to the vibrancy of urgent poetic voices. The book takes for its introit Edward Thomas's ""Words "", and such a celebration of right language echoes through the 287 poems that follow, whether in Roger McGough's explosive ""Poem for a Dead Poet"": ... Words? Why he could almost make 'em
talk or in Emily Dickinson's grave ""A Word is Dead"". Such examples give some token of the breadth of Philip's sym - pat hies . A dozen more could be found to show his recognition of the romantic thrill of poems which, more than any amount of backyard verses, can root and burgeon in children's minds, while his skilled use of juxtaposition makes one poem illuminate another. John Lawrence has a complete understanding of what kind of illustration such sensitive antho - logising requires. The result height - ens the integrity of the volume, which must be numbered among the great anthologies for the young.

ROSALIND BELBEN, LEE HARWOOD AND TOM RAWORTH: Undoubtedly the reading of this week. Among Belben's five novels are The Limit, Dreaming of Dead People and last year's te Beauty Good? Harwood has published 16 books of poetry over the past 20 years, represented by the major collection Crossing the Frozen fl/Ver(Paladin) and his past work appears increasingly poignant, determined to articulate positive qualities of beauty against a disenchanted world. By contrast, Raworth writes fast and pithy poems, delivered at breakneck speed. His is a truly jazz-inflected poetry; from line-to-line and word - to - word , it twists and bobs, it soars. The publication of Tottering State (Paladin), a selection of work from 1963-1987 , confirmed him as a major poet whose achievements are sadly neglected in his homeland.

C arol Ann Duffy writes gos - sips rather than poems, but this is not necessarily a bad thing, granted that any poem is some way of freezing speech so that the freezing doesn't show too much and the speech remains real and becomes memorable. At her best, Duffy achieves something interest - ing in this direction: Love holds words to itself, repeats them till they're smooth , sit silent on the tongue like a small stone you sucked once, for some reason, on a beach... No accident, I think, that such lines define the process that in - spires them. This poet is intelligent, and self-aware , enjoys observing her mind at work, and is amused and dismayed by her own body and the bodies of others. The work in her third collection, The Other Country, has a consistent, lively seriousness which would make it

considering his ""emotions"" as things to ""get through"" ? The answer, no doubt, is the mind that came up with Hawks - moor , so we may respect the writ -
er 's sincerity even if his detachment appals. Of course, Ackroyd may be joking. Some of the poems are post - modernist pastiche in which it would be hard to say where his heart is, or even if he has one. The better poems are sad in probably unintended ways, though this man is so clever you can never be sure. Valerie Gillies is a decent poet who deserves to be better known
outside her native Scotland. The work in The Chanter's Tune (Canongate, £7.95) extends the range of her previous lyrical pieces, providing longer meditations which explore myth, topography and history to good effect. I like the way in which these poems are rooted in the elemental world, and although Gillies seems to have difficulty in letting herself go, emotionally and intellectually, there is both intelligence and sensitivity in the way her poems are made. In common with Duffy and Ackroyd, she is driven by a passion to get the poem ""right"" however awkward the results may sound. In her more successful poems, of course, the craft and the truth are at one, but none of the verse in this
book is much below the level of that marriage. Selected Poems of Vittorio Sereni {Anvil Press, £5.95) is the first substantial volume of English translations of the work of Sereni (1913-1983 ), widely regarded as the finest Italian poet of the generation after Montale. The early work is hermetic and peculiar, using a jerky line to embody difficult states of mind and feeling. The later stuff is more moving in that it broadens out to include a concern for other people, without any sacrifice of intensity. The translations by Marous Perryman and Peter Robinson seem faithful to the way in which Sereni works through fancy to create a nice fugue of insideness and outsideness. There is a good introduction and notes, as well as representative work from all periods of the poet's life. This is uncommonly, good value for a paperback.

#"". i« ' m he greatest thing that Sever happened to Rich - 9 ard Harris was, he be - B lieves, getting tubercu - ""*"" Iosis at the age of 19. Confined to his home in Limerick for three years; there was nothing he could do but read. His bedroom became his university. ""In those days there was a bit of a stigma attached to tuberculosis so I didn't tell my parents at first. But then, because T was always sleeping , I became the object of derision in the house. My father thought I was shirking. ""When they found put the reason for iny always being tired there«# a complete reversal of attitude to overcrowding affec - tion , which in some ways is worse than derision."" 1 He was 23 before he was given a clean bill of health and allowed to begin his adult life with a ticket for the boat to Liverpool., ;' fibril in 1930, the fifth child of eight,, he was brought up in Limerick , in a staunchly Catholic farnily of mixed Catholic and Protestant origins, who owned a terjgfe 'flpuir; mill. They were, he says, in relative terms, very well off, but it was a wealth which was tp. din^inish yearly as he was growing up, as the large companies, took over the mass milling of flour and thebaking of bread.
TH^; farnil y company finally went bankrupt in 1962 just after he had made the film This Sporting Life . He bought the mill with its large silos on the Shannon docks and said he would only sell it when the wind and the rain had washed away his great-great-great grandfather's name James Harris (and Sons) from the sign.. ""I 'ye just sold it thisi week,"" he skys . ^ ""The : name: is completely gone.""v A skilled and wealthy property speculator, he got a good price.""Property values, even in Limerick, have gone up enor - mously in the past 30 years. . As a child he was as he is as a man — always desperately seeking attention. This he puts down to being in the middle of such a large family . He never had anything that was new. And, though it is difficult to believe, he swears his father would forget his name. ""What 's his name again?"" his father Would say. ""That's Dick,"" Ms mother would reply. - , ' /Perhaps not surprisingly he was known to run away from time to time, sleeping rough by the river. ""I was Mid , excessively wild. I can rerherriber my mother looking at my father and saying 'Ivan , what
are we going to do with him? The wildness in adult life is well documented. He is still, he feels, exceedingly restless. Educated, along with his five brothers, at the Jesuit Crescent College in Limerick he was for years a daily communicant, going three miles on his bicycle every morning. At night there would be the family rosary. Although no longer a practising Catholic, he still says the rosary and has two sets of rosary beads always with him. As a boy he had two great loves: rugby and writing poetry. He played for his province, Munster, at rugby (""Because I was big they would put me in the second row, but I didn't do much in the scrum. I played it like a wing forward, wanting to be off and trying to score tries"" ) and he wrote poetry.
The two pursuits could hardly have been less compatible. ""I love poetry, always have done. When I was ill with tuberculosis I discov - ere d Gerard Manley Hopkins , although my father's reading was Mickey Spillane. I wrote all my poems in school books. You should read them. They were published in 1972 and were a big success in America."" As a boy he. was more reticent about his poetry. ""I'd have been regarded as a sissy if people had known about it. A big strapping Irish boy writing poetry? I'd have been regarded as an oddity."" For different reasons, some of which he does not fully under - stand , he was reticent about acting and, when offered the lead in a school production, turned it down and settled for a part in the chorus. The theatre, however , was a major influence on him. :
""In those days they'd have touring companies visiting Lim - erick and I'd go to see them all the time."" Not involved with any amateur dramatics, he did appear on stage in a professional capacity a few times during his teens, playing, on one occasion, the Crowd in Oedipus Rex, for which he got two shillings a week. A more formative moment came, he thinks, at around the age of 18 when he persuaded his father to let him go to Dublin to see a rugby match. ""I had never been anywhere other than to Cork for rugby matches or to County Clare where my parents would rent a house every summer, but I wanted to see Ireland play Scotland. I think it was around 1948 or 1949. ""So I mowed the lawns and helped out in the mill and did all
these things and went off to Dublin with the boys, Paddy Lloyd and Gerry Murphy and the others. And after the match we were drinking cider in a bar, you could drink more cider for less money, and planning to go to a dance when I saw this notice: ""The Gate Theatre presents Micheal MacLiammoir in Pirandello 's Henry IV. And I said 'That's where I'm going. I'll meet you later at the dance.*"" He would like, he says, to be able to say that seeing MacLiam - mo i r is the nice romantic reason he is now bringing the Pirandello to London's Wyndham's Theatre 40 years later, but it would not be true. The play did leave its mark,
though. He can still remember some aspects of the production. I t was shortly after this that he discovered he had tuberculo - sis . With two brothers al - rea dy in the family business and not enough money to pay for him to go to university (there were no grants in Ireland in those days), the three years * convalescence gave him time to think'about his future, and to get over the fact that he would never play rugby, for Ireland. He read prodigiously, and still does. The Jesuits had trained the mind; as he became a burden to his friends and they visited him less fre - quently , tuberculosis helped to complete the education.
""Just think, if I hadn't got TB I'd probably now be a 60-year-old ex-international attached to some club or other who turns up at dinners and talks about the old days and is a total pain. ""Instead of which, I'm sitting in :the Savoy Hotel in London being roasted by the English Press for being irresponsible and tempera - mental , both of which are not true :— in this instance."" (He is feeling particularly bruised about the advance pub - licity for Henry IV, not all of it flattering , some of it no doubt unfair, and much of it gossipy.) In 1953, with £21 in his pocket, he came to London. He didn't have any options. There was no future for him in Ireland. After being turned down by the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and the Central School, he was accepted by the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. After a year at LAMDA he want to work for Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop. ""I was very, very lucky. I learned more in one month with her than I did in 12
months at LAMDA. She was extraordinary and had a tremen - dous influence on my life. ""She'd say 'go for it . Mixer' . She always called me Mixer because that was the first part I played in the West End in The Quote Fellow. That was my first pro - fessional job at the Comedy in 1956. £10 a week."" In all he worked with Joan Littlewood off and on for three seasons , including the Pirandello play Man, Beast and Virtue. Perhaps that is partly why he is so keen to get Henry IV right, he suggests . That was where he learnt so much about Pirandello. ""If Joan Littlewood did a play it was like doing a PhD in it, her preparation was so thorough."" What he particularly likes about
Henry IV is that it is about a man who re-invents himself. He knows that feeling. ""We all create our - selves and rewrite ourselves con - stantly . I did. ""My mother gave me birth, my father sired me and I've got all those genes from the Protestant and Catholic sides of my family and the Freemasons, they're all mixed in. But I created myself. Somewhere along the line I slowly created Richard Harris. ""All th'is stuff about people being the results of their social environment is just sociological rubbish . People come out of here."" He taps his forehead. ""That's what Pirandello's about and that's what I believe."" By the time he reached Holly - wood he had largely invented the
creature he was to inhabit for the next 40 years. He got to know every one of his theatrical genera - tion and to drop the names of the celebrated on every possible occa - sion . He did not, however, satisfy his father's curiosity . On his return to Ireland his father asked if he had met Betty Grable,or ""Betty Grabble"" as he called her. ""No , Dad,"" he said. ""You know Betty Grabble was my hero, Dick, don't you?"" ""I know, Dad ."" Now 60, with his two sisters and his closest brother, Dermot , dead, death and the afterlife are pe - cu liarly on his mind. A few years ago a medium told him of a spirit called Rosie who was with him, a woman from his family who had died before he was born.
When his brother turned up with a mass card from 1912 for Rosie Hartey (his mother's fam - ily ), he began to take the medium seriously . He carries the mass card in his pocket and says he talks to Rosie constantly. He will not be buried in the family vault in Limerick. Both his parents died without him ever making friends with them. ""I didn't dislike them by any manner or means. They were OK parents. It was a good family. We were all happy. But I never got to know them. It wasn't deliberate on their part. They had so many kids to look after. ""But I feel, why would I want to be buried with someone I never got to know? I never made my peace with them.""

Pasternak once defined poetry as ""The crackling of squeezed icicles"", which is good enough , and then again as ""Two nightingales singing a duel "", which is even better. The matter gathered in the new paper - back presentation of his work bears out these splendidly physical defi - nitions very impressively. The book contains his Poems 1955-59 , translated from the Russian by Michael Harari, and the prose of An Essay in Autobiography, translated by Manya Harari. The essay dates from round about the same time as these late poems , and can be taken as an ideal companion to them. Both prose and verse have an admirable lucidity. Under and over every - thing , the picture here given is that of a complete poet, which is to say of a man constantly and seriously engaged with language in the task of clarifying himself so that he may the better be its vessel. Pasternak sought integrity as a man, lucidity as an artist, finding simplicity at deeper and deeper levels.

Rilke once said that poems are not, as the sentimental imagine , simply thoughts and feelings put into lines of a certain shape... they are experiences. Similarly , John Berry - man , attacking an even more pervasive modern heresy, pointed out that the one thing that critics who are not themselves poets tend to forget is that poetry is composed by actual human beings , and tracts of it are very closely about them; ""When Shakespeare wrote *Two loves I have*, reader ,"" said Berry - man , ""he was not kidding."" Rilke and Berryman would have known where they were with the work of D. J. Enright, though I have immediately to qualify that by admitting that he is a far more pedestrian poet than either of those two natural high-flyers . Enright, 70 this year, has made a virtue of refusing to fly at all, and an almost ar t of keeping his metrical feet on the ground. . ""His idiom is undeceived,"" says Douglas Dunn. ""Dennis Enright

That is the conclusion of a modest, uncompromising, and moving poem called ""On the Death of a Child"". Not another refusal to mourn, be it noticed, but a sort of muttered prayer to find a little grace and proportion to mourn properly. I admire this poem, and there are others quite as good in Enright' s Selected Poems 1990, a solid book, and funny as well as sad. At best, indeed, funny and sad in the one breath: My mother's strongest religious feeling Was that Catholics were a sin - ister lot; She would hardly trust even a lapsed one. My father was a lapsed Catholic. Light verse is an art, like any other, with few masters. This is sharp and entertaining stuff, though it would
be sharper if it rhymed and scanned. Still, Enright rings true here, as elsewhere, and it is this element of not kidding , even.wSen he is kidding , that I like in his work . I believe him about his mother and his father . I wish he had written more, with a wider emotional range, about other important experiences : wives, lovers, child - ren , friends. At 70, a man might also be reckoned by the quality of those friends. Life By Other Means collects 21 essays about Enright's life and work by A. S. Byatt, Donald Davie, Derwent May, Pat - ricia Beer, Anthony Thwaite, Paul Theroux, and others . .- • - Blake Morrison has a telling anecdote. An American critic had asked the poet if anyone had ever applied the phrase ""obsessiye humanity"" to his work. No, said Enright, he didn't think they had.

"Wood, James",In search of an England that never was,The Times,1990-Mar-17,"London, England","England that never was
When you are rooted in a place , G. K. Chesterton once wrote, that place disappears . You take as given what should perhaps only be taken as lent ; you assume as inherited that which should be invented. Nationhood becomes an attribute rather than an activity. English literature — and in particular English poetry — is full of instances of such ""disappearance "": again and again, poets define England at the expense of one group or another, or idealize as pastoral that which is in reality far from ideal. There is a direct link between such poets of the early 18th century and the nostalgic yearning of the Georgians of the early 20th . Chesterton (who was in fact discussing Kipling) took this dis - a ppearance of England to be a good thing — he was, in turn , part of this very tradition of disappearance , with his belief in a medieval Merrie England , and his romantic venera - tion of the decency of the little rural man. John Lucas, unsurprisingly, takes this disappearance to be a bad thing, and is himself part of a newer tradition of academic dissent rooted in the work of the critic Raymond Williams. This is, in - de e d , part of the problem with Lucas's unsatisfactory book: Wil - liam s * The Country and the City is forever breathing down the neck of Lucas's slighter but derivative work. This particular territory is so well ploughed that all Professor Lucas can do is fall into the predictable furrows. The methodology is tried and tested. You find out what version of England your selected poet (Clare, Gray, Wordsworth, who - ever ) is offering. You note that this vcisiuii is itu uicainauuii
^uawtuy a pastoral one) of harsh realities : where are the agricultural workers? Where are the references to Enclo - sures ? And then, the inevitable conclusion — this poet's version of England is exclusive not inclusi ve , this poet is appropriating an au - thority —the authority to speak of and for England — which he does not in fact possess . When Raymond Williams first did this in a previous Hogarth Press book, it was thrill - in g : he drew our attention to those parts of England which had dis - appeared , which had been made invisible . He gave a voice to the voiceless. But John Lucas is far from thriningr his methodology is borrowed , his insights merely be - queathed by better critics, his language as bare and banal as academic discourse can be without actually erasing itself from the page. And there is a deeper problem still with his analyses of Goldsmith, Blake, Wordsworth, and Tennyson.
James Wood ENGLAND AND ENGUSHNESS Ideas of Nationhood in English Poetry 1688-1900 By John Lucas The Hogarth Press, £18
It is this: all writers who write about England offer a version of England; but this does not necessarily mean that aU writers are addressing ideas of nationhood , or what it means to be English . In writing about na - tionality , one has to keep the focus tight, or the categories simply expand and fill with air. Of course all English poetry is in some way to do with Englishness; but then all English poetry is also in some way to do with language. Much of Professor Lucas's book is an un - ins p ired survey of the main themes of 18th- and 19th-century poetry, with Englishness forced into the argument to make the critique a little more exciting. To take one instance, Lucas writes of Words - worth 's rewriting of some of .the poems in The Lyrical Ballads Rightly, he stresses that this was part of Wordsworth's adjustment from an earlier radicalism to a later conservatism . ""And so, whereas in Th/> T.vrir/il R/jfl/j/fc he I13H thmnm vw tviivi Bif mM,^f m*mm^&
^ ^^rw (^**»»* mw ^auwvvu into radical doubt any reductive idea of a unitary image of the people and, by implication of England and Englishness ,"" so Wordsworth's image of the people becomes, ""by implication"", his image of England and Englishness. Similarly, Lucas discusses Arnold's poem Dover Beach, and points out (predictably enough) that Arnold lacks the authority he assumes , when he condemns the entire world as having ""neither joy, nor love, not light"". Lucas takes this — again by implication — to be a dismissal of England , since clearly, Dover Beach is on some level a poem about England . But on what level? That is surely the interesting question , one which Lucas will not answer, because he is too busy assuming that Arnold' s poem is about England on all levels. And yet Arnold's elegy Thyrsis, which directly links the loss of England with the loss of a friend and fellow poet (Arthur Clough), does not appear in this book. But this is a poem directly, rather than indirectly , about England and Englishness . In this dangerous area of writing about nationality and its representations , in which the poor critic is beset by all kinds of temptations, one cannot live on implication alone.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0500066643/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=11071a25
Null,Jet-set muse in shades,The Times,1990-Feb-17,"London, England","^& *4 ' *^ S|
For all its cult of the colloquial , one does not feel , in the company of most modern poetry , that the work was quickly written. The chatter of Byron or Browning , the headlong singing of Shelley, the honeyed eloquence of Keats and Spenser, all seem quite alien to anything our century might achieve. It is as if the earlier poets were self-conscious only in matters of technique, and could allow their work to boil j and pour within commonly regarded formal limits; whereas your average modern, however good , is too easily inhib - i ted by self-criticism . John Berryman 's poems go down the page in a great hurry — the thought tumbling, the images head - over - heels , the feeling a sprawl. The man wrote like a market Who's
dead, who's dying, oh the cost of soapflakes ! That sort of thing. Intricate gossip. A siege of voices surging at experience. Notes for my psychiatrist while travelling in search of new psychoses. You have to read him fast His muse wears big dark sun-glasses and might be mistaken for a member of the jet set. Perhaps the best tribute one can pay to such aliveness is to write about his collected works as though he were still with us, never having thrown himself from a bridge in 1972 after waving a characteris - tically casual farewell to some passer-by . That involves irrev - erence , but then Berryman would have asked for nothing less. Collected Poems 1937-1971 , then , quite deliberately establishes the poet himself as a bit of a dear. The first successful piece in it, ""The

COLLECTED POEMS 1937-1971 By John Berryman Edited by Charles Thorobury Faber, £17.50 THE DREAM SONGS By John Berryman Faber, £17.50 Ball Poem"", is full of tenderness for a little boy who has lost his ball, while inspired by knowledge of the distance between the poet and the object of bis pity: I am everywhere , I suffer and move, my mind and my heart move With all that move me, under the water Or whistling , I am not a little boy. Charming ? Disarming ? Of course, but the game's more complicated . Berryman does not just take the reader into his confidence (which is considerable) but into bis lack of confidence (which is vast). He
visits his past selves regularly. The late sequence ""Love & Fame"" (1971) is, like most of his work, an exercise in autobiography done with such a degree of seemingly unpremeditated wit that the effect
is wholly (and, in the circumstances of his suicide, most disconcert - ingly ) present . - .- K Pleasant, too. The poet sends himself up like a little literary rocket Significant, I think, that these good moments come from a sequence rich in such incidentals, if not quite satisfying as a whole. Berryman always worked forwards and backwards, needing a complex structure , a lot of room. His most successful work, it seems to me , is to be found in the sonnets which he wrote in 1947 but refused ,to publish — for laudable personal reasons — until 1966. The best of them have an unusual passion ; modern and archaic in the same breath : iti I wished , all the mild days of*middle March '' , This special year , your blond. good-nature mighlC (Lady) admit — kicking abruptly^ tight With will and affection down; your breast like starch— [ Me to your story... »
The 385 poems called The Dream, Songs , published as a separate volume, have fluency and power in their exploration of the persona of an imaginary character named Henry (** a white American in early middle age sometimes in black - face "" ); unfortunately they also rely on a regular three-stanza form m irregular rhyme which rarely puts that eloquence to any serious test These are chatty poems, literary, diary entries; still, it is good to have the voluminous whole of Berry? man's life-work so ably edited. %*#

"West, David",Latin lover and performing flea,The Times,1990-Feb-01,"London, England","Latin lover and performing flea
O vid is the performing flea of Latin poetry and no translator could hope to jump so high or draw such gilded coaches; but Melville has worked a miracle. It is difficult to imagine that there will ever be an English version so faithful to the Latin , and written in such sound and engaging verse. Melville insists on rhyme , believing that the brilliance of Ovid's verse cannot be re - produced without it; but he avoids the tedium of an unmixed diet of rhyming couplets by using a variety of metres, notably a Melvillian quatrain : Your husband will be there at the same dinner I wish your husband his last meal tonight. I'm just a guest then , gazing at my darling While at your touch another takes delight. And you to warm another's breast will snuggle While round your neck his arm at will he throws . No wonder that for fair Hippodamia , When wine went round, the Centaurs came to blows .
But the translator can't win. There is a gain in suppleness and variety, but it does not compensate for the loss of the Ovidian glitter. Another difficulty for the trans - lator is the level of Ovid's lan - guage . It is so plain, natural , and easy . When he was young he found it difficult to write prose but the poetry flowed — et quod temptabam scribere, versus erat. There are moments when this translation sounds a little dated . This would never have done for Ovid , who was above all a creatur e of his age: The good old days indeed ! I am, thanks be, This age s child: it 's just the age forme . Perhaps , after all, the answer is to drop rhyme and find a scholar poet Guy Lee in 1968 was further from the Latin but closer to the Ovidian esprit. Your husband? Going to the same dinner as us? I hope it chokes him ... You' ll lie there snuggling up to him ? He' ll put his arm round your neck whenever he wants?
OVID The Love Poems Translated by A. D. Melville Oxford, £15 You would not know it from the title page, but the introduction explains that when we leave the Amores and come to the Ars Amatoria , we are reading not Melville's translation , but bis modernization of the dazzling 1935 version by B. P. Moore. For example , when ladies go to the theatre ""They come to look and to be lookedat too. . . "" (spectatum veniunt, veniunt spectentur utipsae ) ""Secure the mistress first: post - pone the maid. .. "" ""Gods have their uses: let's believe they 're there... "" ""I hate a wench who gives because she's bound, While coldly thinking of the wool she's wound . I like not joy bestowed in duty's fee, I'll have no woman dutiful to me.""
D elicious . And yet And yet Although it has all the ""snap and tang"" of the Ovidian elegiac , the fixed rhyme and the fixed number of syllables make it just that little bit less genial. It cloys quicker. Rhyme is tremendous fun in Byron and Gilbert It can't be much fun for a faithful translator. These are astonishing poems, and Melville (and Moore) have worked wonders with them, all the more so since Melville finds Ovid's attitude to women offen - sive , and the poems heartless. But surely Ovid is at play, and the elegiac lover and the elegiac mistress are pawns in his game. The man himself is generous , joyous, warm-hearted / right - minded , sunny-natured . The world he creates is a fantasy world, like Mr Wodehouse's, and like Mr Wodehouse's ""it will never stale... but will continue to release future generations from captivity that may be more irk - some than our own "". To condemn Ovid's attitude to women is like condemning Wodehouse's atti - tude to aunts. ;.

An original guru and pseud A
T ambimuttu arrived in London from Ceylon in 1938 with nimble fingers , a seraphic smile, and (unusual in those days ) a long loose silky mane of hair. He claimed to be a prince at home, and he intended to become the prince of poetry in London. He was only 23. Geoffrey Grigson christened him quickly Tutti - Fru tti . There was something about bis cast of mind and ways with women that a certain sort of Englishman at once and instinc - tively disliked. We hear more from the admir - ers than detractors in this volume, which is what is called a Festschrift and so by definition favourable to the subject, though it is always possible to read between the lines. The 60 contributors of memories of Tambi provide a vivid picture of the chaotic character who founded and edited Poetry London , one of the few small magazines to survive in wartime, and who virtually invented Fitzrovia , an Indianate country of vagabonds and sadhakhas or seek - ers , in which he occupied the man of wisdom role. Who was Tambi? Fact or fic - t ion ? Genius or charlatan ? The best thing in the book is ""Swami Rock, Riga Rock"" , Tambi's own evocative story of his upbringing. In it he explains the Indian propensity for changing clothes and reversing personalities. Tambi himself had their inherited techniques. He would mesmerize people, with the stillness of the snake charmer. And then he would vanish in a little puff of smoke. He loved ecstasy , a quality that seems to have endeared him to T. S. Eliot , if not the Hampstead rationalists . Eliot welcomed him to England. With his childlike perceptiveness Tambi made the comment : ""Mr Eliot is really a

wild man, like me."" England , on the edge of war, was ready for the riot of the emotions Tambi offered. The covers of Poetry > London were de- J signed with A regulation lyre ?| birds, symbols of % pure ecstasy, in versions by Suther- ' land and Moore and
Ceri Richards. ^SJ Tambi, looking back, ^ attributed the upsurgings « of ecstasy to his childhood visits to the Hindu temples.
These liberated and exhilarated all his senses ""like a plate of very hot rice and curry "".
As it happened, Tambi was himself a poet. On the basis of the poems included in this collection it is tempting to conclude he was not a very good one. Gita Sarasvati, A Theology for Modern Science is a psychedelic version of The Waste Land , with far too much about those Cosmic Geese and Ganders. Tambi's talent was for bringing but the poetry in others . He believed that every man had poetry within him, a mystical principle he took to its logical conclusion by handing out his grant for editorial expenses to the man who came to clean the windows at his flat Tambimuttu was the ultimate consulter of the navel. As described by a girl-groupie — a number of whom contribute fondly to this Festschrift — he
would quite literally gaze down at his diaphragm, seeking inspira - t ion , before answering a question. At moments we are certainly in Peter Sellarsland. Tambi's cult of anti-ego was a help when trouble threatened . He was always in debt, and he was frequently pursued by the anxious owners of the manu - scri pts he kept under his bed in an overflowing chamber-pot The famous Trance of Tambi was defence inviolable and im preg - nable : ""I am not a person : I am a mood, a weather , an accent of the
mind."" But in fact for a man who claimed to be so incorporeal, Tambi was remarkably prone to fleshly pleasures. Back in Ceylon, a little voyeur in the making , his glimpses of white women through an open door or window had excited and delighted him. He lost no time in England. In the Poetry London office his advances on the secretaries were so frequent and insistent a protective male assis - tant had to put up his umbrella. Balmy, barmy Tambimuttu. He
took baths extremely rarely, but an office girl recruited to provide a wash-and-whipping reported that surprisingly, his smell was baby - swee t In London in the wartime Tambi was successful because he was so different: the brown face in the white city; the pacifist in wartime. (He would playfully flick over the medals of the warriors returning to the Wheatsheaf .) In the Fifties in America the magic seemed to leave him. The explana - t ion offered by Robin Waterfield , most acid and enlightening of writers about Tambi, the spectre at the Festschrift, is probably the true one: that New York had become blase about gurus. It had had too many holy men of wisdom of its own.
If I were choosing examples for a study of the derelict interior I should certainly go for Tambimuttu. He specialized in the literary bed-sit : unmade bed, strewn books and beer cans, and the lopsided (signed) portrait of T. S. Eliot hung up on a nail. In New York , as he drank and drugged himself into oblivion, his succession of apartments, stop - overs , and hovels got starker and more desperate , suffused with ancient curries. Yes, there is an awful lot of assorted curry in this book. Tambi was a flower-power per - son long before that movement was defined. In the 1960s he came into his own again, consorting with the Beatles (in the Maharishi period) and producing a few numbers of Poetry London/Apple Magazine. Tambi was a crashing snob, and he adored the Royal Family . One of his last projects was a grandiose edition of Indian Love Poems, illustrated by John Piper. He sent a personal copy to the Queen of England, choosing as his unlikely emissary , David Frost You take what you get in a Festschrift. What is missing is a serious account of Tambi's rela - t ions with his uncle, Ananda Coomaraswamy , who, a genera - t ion earlier, made the same un - set tling journey from east to west He too became a feted figure around London, the acceptable shaman of his age. His was the famous dictum ""Every man is a special sort of artist"", and he persuaded avid audiences (Eric Gill among them) of the essential sacredness of Hindu erotic art A biographer of Tambi would need to take account of the role of both the uncle and the nephew in infiltrating Hinduism into English culture.

S hane MacGowan is the lead singer of the Pogues, a band which has cut a jagged course through the meek Eighties with their mix of punk attitude, Irish folk song-writing and im - passioned delivery. Poguetry, a book of MacGowan's fierce lyrics, illus - trated by expressionistic ink drawings by John Hewitt and the documentary-style black - and - white photos by Steve Pyke, has upset some sections of the media. It is published by Faber and Faber, and the general reaction to it has been: how can such a distinguished publishing house add a rock-and-roll item to an august poetry catalogue? ""It was commissioned as a popular culture book and not as a poetry book,"" says Tracey Scho - field , the editor responsible for commissioning it. Does this mean that Faber and Faber does not consider MacGowan's lyrics to be poetry? ""No , they are something quite different,"" Schofield says. ""There is a narrative and they make great stories, but they have choruses and are quite formal."" According to the illustrator, John Hewitt, ""it has brought a lot of snobbery crawling out of the woodwork. The original idea was for a Pogues tour book; there are so many members of the band that
they are like a travelling troupe and they are very democratic All the crew has equal status."" Grad - ually the project turned into an illustrated book of MacGowan's lyrics. ""After all, without him there wouldn't be the Pogues,"" says Hewitt ""He is the focus."" Initially Hewitt, who conceived the idea of the book with photog - rapher Pyke, wanted to do detailed illustrations to accompany the songs, but ""they became immedi -
ate , captured-moment sketches,"" he says. ""Some of them do refer to the lyrics but it's more my observations."" Hewitt's usual subject matter — London streetlife, the low-life rather than the street credible — made him an appropriate match for MacGowan, whose preoccupa tion with the steamier side of life is well-known . And Pyke's method of photography was equally suited to the Pogues' style. He practises the
""propped up against the wall with a drink and a camera"" type of reportage . ""It's a nightmare if yon try to set up a band picture,"" he says. ""You have to catch them like Pennebaker [director of 1965 Bob Dylan documentary Don't Look Back] does with his films."" MacGowan's lyrics are compel - ling observations of the world around him: pubs, poverty or contemporary pretension. Angry feelings pour out of him but, in the final reckoning, he is an incurable romantic as well. ""One summer evening drunk to hell I sat there nearly lifeless An old man in the comer sang Where the water lilies grow And on the juke box Johnny sang About a thing called love And ifs how are you kid and Whafs your name And how would you bloody know"" (Tide: A Pair of Brown Eyes) Faber and Faber have printed 10,000 copies of Pogaetry. ""There is a young audience who are not being catered for, who enjoy lyrics and visual stimulation,"" says Schofield. There is, more than likely, an older one as well.

B ooks! said Scrooge. ""Humbug ! I wonder what we have pub - lished in 1989 that is worth cutting down trees to make paper for the stuff? The only book published this year that I like the sound of, aptly titled Vain Conceit, was by a young nephew of mine, Ddomladen Jeremiah Taylor.

He was secretly gratified at being haunted yet again, as the only exemplar of literary Christmas known to the great British reading public. Dick - ens ' was emotionally involved with Scrooge. He wrote about himself in the third person at the time he was working on A Christmas Carol: ""Charles Dick - ens ' wept and laughed and wept again, and excited himself in a most extraordinary manner in the composition : and thinking
whereof he walked about the black streets of London, fifteen and twenty miles many a night when all the sober folks had gone to bed."" Dickens always exaggerated his 'performance. He was a journalist. The Ghost of Christmas Books heaved his annual sigh. He was supernaturally tall, and spec - tacled , and bent over his walking - s t ick , and, in spite of an eternity of authors' lunches in the best res - tauran ts and publication parties of cheap plonk in plastic cups in the worst restaurants, preternaturally thin. His body was transparent : so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking through his waistcoat, could see the unpaid VAT bills in his back pocket . His name was Christopher Simply-Saintly , and henyas in the process of setting up hisbwn publishing house in order to try to please the vain and grumpy nephew of Scrooge .
""Come on, old thing ,"" said the Ghost of Christmas Books. ""You know you don't really mean it Some of our best novelists have
books out in time for Christmas. Our only living Nobel literary laureate, Bill Golding, has finally brought his historical nautical trilogy home from the sea—phew , and splice the mainbrace, chaps, it has been a long journey, but worth the sea-sickness . Graham Greene, who should have won the Nobel years ago but for the malice of a Scroo whoops! — a mean - minded judge, has two books out for Christmas: admittedly cold cabbage recycled, viz. letters to editors and the collected epigraphs to his works, the latter working out at £1 per word written for him by somebody else. Then there are novels from Ackroyd, Anita Brookner, Drabble, Barnes, Fran - cis King, Atwood, Iris Murdoch, Martin Amis. This is a vintage year for fiction.""
""Poppycock !"" snarled Scrooge. ""As Scrooge Taylor says, a novel is less important than a roof over your head, and a good deal less important than a square meal. Is there no Arts Council? Are there no literary prizes? Why should I have to support mendicious and mendacious authors? Who is this Murdoch you rave about ? The same one that you made me read a year or two ago? I'll warrant that her book is full of people with strange names like Gildas and Marzillian, Womans Own melo - drama dressed up in north Oxford chatter, a madman who thinks he has discovered the secret of the universe, and a closed community much like those found in James Bond junk, but less enjoyable. She has been writing the same book for years, and I didn't even like it first time round.""
T hat is your loss, Ebenezer,"" said the Ghost of Christmas Past, gently. ""There are many in the Iris Murdoch fan club for whom Christmas is incomplete without a new Murdoch. Her idiosyncratic mixture of emo - tional intensity and high intelli - gence is part of the attraction. I do not see how somebody with your Christian name can grumble about strange names. And, since you refer authors to literary prizes
for their bread, it is interesting that none of these first-rate novelists was even listed for a prize. It demonstrates better than most years the perverse and wicked lottery of literary awards.A smile of Schadenfreude flickered across Scrooge's thin mouth , like winter sunshine glin t - ing on a coffin Jid. ""I did enjoy the wailing and gnashing of teeth,"" he said. ""The Booker prize was won, I gather from the fellows at the 'Change who take an interest in literature ,"" (Scrooge pronounced it literachooer, with a sneer), ""by a book written by a Japanese about an English butler , who did not even know that you should decant vintage port, and then thought
that it was handed round. Pah!"" ""Well , as a matter of fact, The Remains of the Day is a sad and funny story of failed love and failed ideals,"" said the Ghost of Christmas Books, who was an old - fashioned , kindly reviewer. ""And wry, and sensitive, and all the other OK critics' epithets, and a perfectly honourable winner of the Booker, though some of the butlering may be a touch eccen - tric .

... , Irving Wardle
In this first departure from the classical repertory , the Cheek by Jowl troupe presents a piece based on the life of Ireland's only woman executioner. All the programme claims for Lady Betty is that she ""probably"" held this job at Roscommon Gaol in the late 1700 s. Declan Donnellan takes the legend of Lady Betty (recorded by Oscar Wilde's father) as a springboard into folklore and the fatalistic grip
of Irish history, creating a text that draws upon the dream structures of fairytale and Irish stage routines. She channels the compa - ny 's performance skills into dance and traditional Irish music. One tastes the flavour of the show with the opening sight of the death's-head heroine (Sally Dex - ter ) storming through the chorus, ragged petticoats whirling, and then imperiously commanding them to dance until they drop. The action then unfolds in the manner of a ballad, drawing a savage contrast between the Prot - estant ascendency and the des ti -
tute Catholic population. Betty reappears as a docile young ser - vant , being coaxed into a pre - seduction minuet by her employer . She then sinks into outcast starvation, and unwi t - tingly kills her unknown son when he takes shelter in her hovel. The reels and unearthly back - s tep dances are spellbinding, but they sometimes swamp the nar - rative . What is always clear is Betty's transformation' from an obscure, wretchedly abused girl into an figure of reputed power: from degraded outcast to witch and then to licensed killer.
Donnelan is in full command of the Celtic folk-tale idiom, but he is not locked inside it: he can switch to patriotic rhetoric, authoritarian British speech , and even bring on a turnkey comedian (Ray McBride) with gags about word-r processors. But poetry is the central and most sinister element . It takes over whenever death invades the stage : Betty kills her son as if in a controlled dream, and when she hangs the ""whiteboy"" rebel (Gerard O'Hare ), ropes and shackles van - ish , and she gently cradles his head for a long sleep. Politically she is an ambiguous figure, but in Dex - ter 's demonaic performance she fearsomely projects the control - ling shadow of the Irish past.

Sorley MacLean is widely acknowl - edged as an important poet in his native Gaelic — perhaps the most original and inventive poet to use Gaelic at all. Those who cannot read him in that language should lose no time in acquiring his From Wood to Ridge, a collected poems where Gaelic and English versions are printed on facing pages, the English in the poet's own transla - tion . Here at last is a key to some of the most fiercely impassioned po - etry of this century, poetry con - cerned with what Alun Lewis once called ""the single poetic theme of Life and Death"". MacLean's first book, Dain do Eimhir, published in 1943, still
remains his best — a sequence of love poems crossed or cursed by a self-torturing awareness of history. MacLean at the point of writing these poems was a committed Communist, ashamed that he had not fought in Spain, torn between personal and political passion. Perhaps the pressures were greater in that his Highland world was so narrow? Perhaps that world was not narrow at all, but the force of MacLean's feelings would have gone to the making of powerful poetry at any time and in any place? Whatever the reason, here it seems are the poems which none of the English language poets of the 1930s managed to write.
But for you the Cuillin would be an exact and serrated blue rampart girdling with its march-wall all that is in my fierce heart. This, the beginning of ""The Blue Rampart"" , is typical of MacLean in that while it does not employ the word ""love "", it is suffused by that emotion to such a degree that its intensity restores tarnished images to a state of grace. The other big achievement here is without doubt the strange poem ""Hallaig"" , in which the deer on the high hills are celebrated as creatures of myth. This has an extraordinary tone — raw, peremptory, preoccu pied with absolutes, indifferent to cleverness, the real thing. MacLean reveals himself to the reader with - out Gaelic as a poet of the first rank within the Gaelic tradition. Rilke has a phrase somewhere

What it does manage, though, is to suggest the feel of Rilke's thought, the winding verse-sentences , the way his poems move in a logic that is.quite other than the logic of prose. All that one ought to say briefly of Rilke, as of MacLean, is perhaps this: in his poems we are in the presence of inspiration. Inspira - t ion , the action of what Words - worth called ""the feeling intellect"", is not, of course, taken very seriously in poetry just now.

"Ackroyd, Peter",The theatre of Poetry,The Times,1989-Jul-15,"London, England","Peter Ackroyd on the collaborations of Isherwood and Auden
V erse drama might have been invented for Au - den , it so suited his natural gifts: the sudden shafts of sententious - ness , the wonderful gnomic ab - s t rac ti ons , the technical dexterity, the fluid cadence which consorted both with the most theoretical argument and with the most pellu - cid detail. In fact it might be said that he began with drama—his first published writing (published, that is, beyond the ambit of school and university magazines) was a short theatrical piece entitled Paid on Both Sides ; it appeared in the Criterion in 1930 and there is no doubt that its editor * T. S. Eliot, was happy to find that his own incipient taste for modern poetic drama was shared by the most enterprising representative of the younger generation of writers. They might be said to have created between them, in England, the kind of theatre that was already a powerful force in Europe. But if there was some similarity of direction between Auden and Eliot, there were equally important differences. In these early years
Eliot saw the drama as a rare hybrid of the Mass, of avant-garde ballet, and of the music hall — remote and hierarchic, but filled with- the rhythms and diction of pantomime speech, as if Massine has suddenly begun to talk like Marie Lloyd. For Auden the drama was vaguely connected with a more than usually vague political awareness of what were then known as ""ifte masses"" — but if from the beginning he had said that drama was essentially a ""social art"", his own practice would soon disprove it. He and Isherwood (the joint authors in a volume where, without Edward Mendelson's exact scholar - ship , it would be impossible to know where one ends and the other begins) had seen the future of the theatre in Germany, and it seemed to work. And what could be more heady for this generation of new writers than the spectacle of a truly avant-garde aesthetic being effort lessly combined with political sat -

Certainly it seems to have been one of the initial inspirations behind the formation of the Group The - atre , the home for most of Auden's dramatic work, and the exemplar of what he called ""a co-operative"" and a ""community"" . Auden was no doubt trying to inveigle the ""masses"" in this enterprise, too, but the audience at the Group Theatre productions were rather more rar efied young men in dark blue shirts and horn-rimmed glasses (the shirts in particular were de rigueur) who soon settled down to enjoy what were essentially extensions of undergraduate revue. And that is largely what has been repr inted here — 10 years of verse drama, published and unpublished, but with the major items being Paid On Both Sides, The Dance of Death, The Dog Beneath the Skin, The Ascent qfF6 and On the Frontier These last three were written by Auden in collaboration with Isher - wood , although Auden was nec - essarily the dominant partner.
The first of these pieces, Paid On Both Sides, is called a ""charade "", which, despite its un - pleasant association with country house parties, is really a kind of early 20th-century masque: from the beginning Auden was trying to place his poetry in some context other than the proclama - tions of the individual self. But a reading of these plays is enough to suggest that the obsessions which informed his verse, and the context which helped to create it, are here merely on an away-day ticket which will bring them safely back to home. Even in this first short drama are to be found the stage cockney (always rendered in Auden's work with something sus -
piciously like a sexual thrill), the head of a reformatory for boys (ditto), the manager of a lead mine. But this was an exercise, and Auden first really came to prom - inence in the theatre with the staging of The Dance of Death in 1934, a play which still retains all the exuberance of its youthful inventiveness, and all the humour of a writer who prefers to play with, rather than elaborate upon, his ideas. The Dog Beneath the Skin and The Ascent ofF6 are perhaps the best known of these collabora - tions ; and, with their combination of comedy, myth, ritual, and Jaco - bean rant, it is impossible not to admire their dexterity even as it becomes increasingly difficult to penetrate beneath the private jokes, the recondite vocabulary of ob - sessions , and what can only be described as a form of political camp — the aspiration towards meaning combined with the gig - gling rejection of it, the use of potent symbols and beliefs in a context that really places them
within a repertoire of comic effects. And yet out of such things great beauty can emerge, and (although Isherwood himself of course wrote fiction) the dramas in this volume make it easy to understand why poets have a better track record than novelists in writing for the theatre — this is partly because drama itself has its deepest roots in poetry, but also because poetry was, in this period between the two world wars, a highly theatrical art. It might be said, in fact, that the greatest dramatic writing of the early 20th century is to be found in its poetry — The Waste Land being perhaps the most obvious can - didate for such a position. Of course that impetus has passed — fiction is now the dominant literary form, and, if novelists are drawn to any art other than their own, it is to film rather than to theatre. And yet until a novelist writes a film-script as powerful as The Ascent ofF6, the advantage will remain with the poets of the recent past, and with the plays so carefully and amply repr inted here.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0503236584/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=e7fc8487

With Gunther Herbig from the Detroit Symphony still standing in for the ailing Andre Previn at the Royal Philarmonic Or - ches t ra 's continuing Beethoven series, a kind of climax was reached when Krystian Zimerman appeared as the soloist in the ""Emperor"" Concerto . Since he first came to youthful prom - inence , over a decade ago, he has been among the most poetic and imaginative pianists around, even if occasionally controversial. ; To hear his views on one of the favourite works in the Concerto repertory was never less than stimulating, often with delight in the clarity of his articulation at the keyboard and in the fluency of his passage work. Any doubts in the opening movement were confined to his overall grasp of his struc - t ure , being inclined to press forward a shade too much to sense the power and searching character that bears the weight of Beetho - ven 's argument For the slow movement of the
pianist and conductor were in agreement on a sensible medium tempo, which allowed the oppor - tunity to appreciate Zimerman's shading of colour and rhythm , and his instinct for subtly pointed detail. This made it the more strange that he should favour such a tearaway course in the Rondo finale, darting this way and that and not really pulling it together until the closing pages. The orchestra gave him soundly paced , sometimes stolid support , following a first part of the programme in which they vig - orously dispatched both the Over - ture to Egmont and the First Symphony. The latter had the virtue of being given its fullest extent, with practically all the repeats taken in each movement , which meant that its proportions acquired a more imposing effect There was , however , little attempt by the conductor to go beyond the outline of a phrase, or to coach much felicitous feeling from the strings in particular.

"Wood, James",In love with breaking free,The Times,1989-Jun-03,"London, England","BM$&m&W £
James Wood celebrates the work of a purist late romantic who has written 'some of the finest modern lyric poetry in English'
} riters , said W. H. Auden, XXT are usually in the unfortu - V V nate predicament of hav - "" - ''i ing to speak the truth without having the authority to speak it Auden, who never lived under a dictatorship , was giving authority a personal, authorial gloss — writers don't always have greater access to large truths than anyone else, though it is their business to dispense them. What Seamus Heaney is con - cerned with in this fine book is a harsher lack: that dark moment , experienced by writers throughout the unfree world, when authority is no longer simply how you will choose the next word, but a question of who will choose it for you. Heaney writes beautifully of the Russian poet Osip Mandel - s t am , for instance , arrested in 1934 for his grim poem about Stalin : He rolls the executions on his tongue like berries
He wishes he could hug them like big friends from home. Mandelstam 's is ""a modern martyrology, a record of courage and sacrifice which elicits our unstinted admiration ,"" writes Heaney ; and he is rightly sceptical of the pallid pleasures of much poetry in English , when compared with the flushed vigour, the huge temerity of today's Mandelstams — writers like the Polish poets Zbig - niew Herbert and Czeslaw Milosz. But there are other Czechs of poetic authority , closer to Auden 's lucky individualism. What authority, for instance , does the lyric poet have in the face of tempestuous tragedies, material eruptions? What good are

jeers which the lyric poet en - counters . Lyric poetry, he writes , is often an em - barrassin g intru - sion , ""a free gift
freshly-baked lyric at every nat - ional festivity , but the idea of his doing so at every national tragedy is hideously laughable. ""Elegy in a Hillsborough stadium"" ... ? Heaney writes about the tangled ethics of these eternal worries with all his customary intelligence , all his habitual passion. Conceptually tighter than his last selection of prose (Preoccupations) this book returns to its governing theme in nearly every chapter the joys and
in the presence of the unfree and the hurt"". And yet Heaney cele - bra tes the miracle of this freedom as well as any poet has ever done in prose (even Mandelstam , I think). The lyric poem is, writes Heaney, ""a paradigm of free action"" (this recalls Auden's comment which he does not mention , that ""every good poem is very nearly Utopia"" ); it ""always has an element of the untrammeled about it... in this way, the order of art becomes an
achievement intimating a possible order beyond itself ."" Heaney distinguishes between two states of tongued governance : 1, when poetry is its own govern - men t , when it has ""its own vindicating force... the tongue granted the right to govern""; and when poetry is itself governed, not only by authoritarian diktat but by subtler pressures — by the social and semantic meanings which ev - ery word inherits, and by the needs and desires of the public. (Pope would be an obvious example ; Heaney's is the American poet Elizabeth Bishop with reticent , mannerly tones, and her "" inclina - t i o n to conciliate the social audience"".)
This binary division confirms (if we did not already know it) Heaney as the purist late romantic, in love with explosions of the heart , with the joyous liberties of breaking free of verbal government , to reach that moment when , as he writes , ""the tongue is suddenly ungoverned"". And why should Heaney sink this lovely buoyancy? His romanti - cism has produced some of the finest modern lyric poetry in English (along with Derek Walcott and Richard Wilbur). Furthermore, his poems criti - cally meditate on the very checks and liberties about which he writes so well in prose. In ""Exposure"" for instance , Heaney ponders on for whom he writes, for the inner lyric ear or the outer social ear ""For what? For the ear? For the people?/ For what is said behind-backs ?"" One can only pray that the Muse will grant him many more years of ungoverned joy.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0500391782/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=9f50cee1

BBC SO/ Zagrosek Festival Hall/ Radio 3 Brian Eiias is not a composer to play for safety. His latest work, introduced at last night's BBC Symphony Or - chestra concert, takes just about every possible risk, facing technical hazards in setting Russian words and putting them into the most rarely successful of musioal forms , the orchestral song cycle, and also going for moral danger in taking its texts from prison poetry. No doubt this was the
greatest. peril, that the music would seem merely to be profiting, in the at least comparative comfort of the Festival Hall, from the sufferings of its chosen poet, Irina Ratushinskaya. But there was no question of that, partly because Eiias handles her verse with tact and care even when his amplification of it is most vociferous, and partly because there is such abundant inventiveness in this half-hour score. Amply gifted as an orchestral com - poser , but finding himself only very seldom given the chance to exercise his imagination. i
CONCERT Eiias seems to have been able to identify with the condition of creativity exploding out of constraint. The result is a set of five songs in which the music responds directly to mood and image, but finds a great deal else to do as well. They are songs of innocence and experi - ence , the contraries repre - sented by childhood and imprisonment or, in the music, by the clamour of the first and fourth numbers and the quietness (nostalgic or expectant?) of the second and
last. Particularly impressive is the final pairing: the tearing, brutal sounds of ""Pencil Let - ter "" which never get in the way of the singer, so that the latter can remain fresh and personal (these are settings of Ratushinskaya's voice as much as of her words), and then the high, dry atmosphere of the finale, introduced by a cadenza for celeste with other tuned percussion.

PETER ACKROYD My choice of the most enjoy - able reading this year is en - tirely connected with poetry: John Ashbery's latest volume, April Galleons (Carcanet, £8.95), is astonishing in its range and power. Crossing The Frozen River (Paladin, £5.95), Lee Harwood's col - lected poems, is the work of a poet who deserves much greater recognition. Collected Poems and Selected Prose of A. E. Housman, edited by Christopher Ricks (Allen Lane £18.95), must stand high on any list for sheer enjoyment. VICTORIA GLENDINNING Penelope Fitzgerald's The Beginning of Spring (Collins, £10.95) is an unforgettably sad and funny novel set in Mos - cow in the winter of 1913. So much about the texture of life in the nervous, ice-bound city is conveyed that you feel, afterwards, as if you had read a much denser book.
WOODRO W WYATT Horsesweat and Tears by Simon Barnes (Heinemann, £12.95) is the most civilized book I have read on racing. It describes a year's life in the stable of John Dunlop, a leading trainer, with its trag - edies , disappointments, excitements, hopes and suc - cesses . Goodbye Fleet Street by Robert Edwards (Cape, £12.95) is the rattling auto - biography of a brilliant editor . New anecdotes about Lord Beaverbrook, Robert Maxwell and others abound. Tolstoy by A.N. Wilson (Hamish Hamil - ton , £16.95) is an original approach to the towering but tiresome subject. It is enth - ralling and beautifully written. RICHARD HOLMES
In a blazing good year for modern English biograpy, I have particularly relished a little Celtic twilight and scep - ticism in the shape of Richard Ellmann's a long the riverrun (Hamish Hamilton; £13.95), selected essays, paradoxical and alas posthumous, from the old biographical master of Joyce, Yeats and Wilde. In the same spirit, a heretical and wonderfully provocative ac - count of the earlier slorm - and - stress generation, Romantic Affinities: Portraits from an Age 1780-1830 (The Bodley Head, £16), by the young historian Rupert Christiansen, has greatly pleased. Finally, enormous, melancholy satis - faction from Philip Larkin's Collected Poems (The Marvell Press/Faber, £16.95).
FIONA MacCARTHY Peter Gay's Freud: A Life for our Time (Dent, £16.95); Michael Holroyd's Bernard Shaw, Volume 1 (Chatto & Windus, £16); and Dame Alix Meynell's Public Servant, Pri - vate Woman (Gollancz, £16.95), the most captivating autobiography for years, by the widow of the publisher and poet, Francis Meynell, who was herself, as Alix Kilroy, a woman of power at the Board of Trade. It is a candid and intelligent por - trayal of an unconventional marriage and devoted female friendship with Evelyn Sharp.
JAMES WOOD One book arrived this year with the finality of a tomb - stone , and a sad inscription for a title: Larkin's Collected Poems (The Marvell Press/Faber, £16.95) means what it mourns — there can be no more poems. Inside that book, however, are the best poems written in England since Eliot. Larkin the public property is a nostalgic whose famous philis - tinism seems like the quaint quintessence of Englishness. But the Larkin of the poems is not a nostalgic but an elegist. A nostalgic remembers the presence of the past; an elegist
dismembers its absence. For him every moment is elegiac because every moment has disappeared as soon as you live it, and certainly as soon as you record it in a poem. JONATHAN MEADES Peter Conrad's Down Home, (Chatto & Windus, £12.95) is not in the least ""down home"". There is nothing quaint, noth - ing folklorically cracker-barrel about this autobiography, which poses as a travel book, which in turn mutates into an hallucination of Tasmania and thence into a gaudy run-in with mnemosyne, a medita - tion on belonging, an in - vestigation of place-time . Alain Robbe-Grillet 's Ghosts In The Mirror, translated by Jo Levy (John Calder, £10.95), is another tour de force of reminiscence contaminated by invention, another record of luminous self-creation
From Larkin to Lodge, Macmillan to Mozart, Ireland to Hong Kong — a selection of Times writers and critics suggest some of their favourite books of 1988 to give as presents
BRYAN APPLEYARD Michael Moorcock, one of our best novelists, was studiously ignored by the Booker judges. Mother London (Seeker & Warburg, £9.95) was his masterpiece and should be read and re-read in years to come. John Ashbery's April Galleons (Carcanet, £8.95) was as beautiful a collection of poetry as one could wish for. As if that weren't enough, Don DeLillo's Libra (Viking, £11.95) gave one the uneasy, but definitely exhilarating, feeling that the Americans are doing something newer and better in prose as well.
CHRIS PEACHMENT Most pleasure of the year was afforded by Alan Ross's Coastwise Lights (Collins, £12.50). The autobiographical element of his book is decently modest, it is written in ex - cellently clear prose, which reads like the raw material for his poetry, and it contains acute, friendly portraits of postwar literary figures from the likes of Julian McLaren - Ross and Henry Green to Agatha Christie. I also enjoyed Barry Unsworth's Sugar and Rum (Hamish Hamilton, £11.95), and David Lodge's Nice Work (Seeker & War - burg , £10.95).
FICTION JOHN NICHOLSON In a disappointing year, I'll go for two newcomers. The Eden Man (Andre Deutsch, £10.95) is wildly funny and better controlled than anything writ - ten by Tom Sharpe since the early Seventies. Neil Fer - guson 's Putting Out (Hamish Hamilton, £10.95) was another very accomplished first novel. It's a spoof thriller set in the upper reaches of New York's rag trade. George MacDonald Fraser's The Sheikh and the Dustbin (Col - lins Harvill, £10.95) brought the Private McAuslan saga to a suitably rousing conclusion.
ELAINE FEINSTEIN Love in Time of Cholera by Gabriel Garcia Marques (Cape, £11.95) is a delight; a pungent, quirky tale of long marriage, patient courtship and sex in old age, very much his best book since 700 Years of Solitude. Nice Work by David Lodge (Seeker & War - burg , £10.95) is an ingenious and extremely funny look at contemporary. England di - vided into two nations every bit as- much as in Disraeli's time. And Tom Wolfe's amaz - ing Bonfire of the Vanities (Cape, £12.95) is satire on a grand scale - {he fastest and most compulsively readable book of the year.
PHILIP HOWARD Oscar and Lucinda by Peter Carey (Faber, £10.95) is a Booker winner that one can enjoy as well as admire.
Starting with a religious war between the generations (which borrows a lot from Gosse's Father and Son), it travels to Sydney of a century ago. Here, it describes a rich world of Dickensian charac - te rs , with fascinating detail on private pursuits from glass - making to gambling, drama and jokes. Nice Work by David Lodge (Seeker & War - burg , £10.95) mixes Lodge's Never-Never Academe of Rummidge University with the harsh world of industrial decline outside. STUART EVANS Baby Todd and the Rattle - snake Stradivarius by Teresa Kennedy (The Bodley Head, £11.95) for its hilarity, its
fantasy and its elegiac mo - ments involving two families in a web of love, laughter, envy, lust and attrition woven around the magic fiddle. Rich in Love by Josephine Hum - phreys (Collins Harvill, £10.95), for its richness in that very attribute as well as in character and incident, as a delightful young woman sorts out the gentle turbulence of her unpredictable family and in so doing discovers herself. City of Marvels by Eduardo Mendoza (Collins Harvill, £10.95), for its picaresque account of a villainous ad - venturer against the backcloth of Barcelona bustling and groaning with growing pains at the turn of the century.
ISABEL RAPHAEL After the hurly burly guess - work of the breakfast table, how pleasant to sit down with Philip Howard's paperback of Word-Watching (Elm Tree Books, £4.95), relish the wit of the false etymologies, and enjoy the erudition of the true definitions. The best news oh the novel front is that Anita Brookner is back on form with her new book, Latecomers (Cape, £10.95); and Alison Lurie is tart and sparkling in The Truth about Lorin Jones (Michael Joseph, £11.95). ANDREW SINCLAIR Ted Hughes and William Blake take the Bible to heart. Only as little children may we aproach the divine. Tales of the Early World (Faber, £5.95) may seem to be a children's book, but it is for all who can wonder with the young. I cannot remove Gert
Hofmann's The Parable of the Blind (Seeker & Warburg, £10.95) from my insight. He tells the story of Brueghel's painting of the six blind men stumbling and screaming. The door of the underworld is opened by The Lyre of Or - pheus (Viking, £11.95) by Robertson Davies. This last and best of his trilogy of novels about the influence of a mysterious Canadian painter is a book for Boxing Day to release the belly-laugh .
THRILLERS TIM HEALD In the new Deighton, Spy Hook (Hutchinson, £11.95), successor to Game, Set and Match and precursor of Line and Sinker, all the old favourites lurch about the international stage shooting themselves and each other in the feet. They're finally begin - ning to grow on me, and this time the prose seems to have lost some of the middle-aged spread I thought I'd detected.
lected Letters 1926-1950 (Max Reinhardt, £30), the last of four volumes edited by Dan H. Laurence, has given me a lot of pleasure.
SCIENCE FICTION TOM HUTCHINSON I realize I was only lukewarm in my original review of Isaac Asimov's Prelude To Founda - tion (Grafton, £11.95), the sixth in his remarkable future - and psycho-history . This, coming last, is the curtain - raiser to the others, Dr A. having obviously had sixth thoughts about how it was all going to originate. It was a book that took me back to the others and the realization that here is one of the most staggering achievements in modern SF.
POLITICS JOHN GRIGG Having just finished R.F. Foster's Modern Ireland 1600 - 1972 (Allen Lane, the Penguin Press, £18.95), I think it is the book I have most enjoyed this year. Foster is a young Irish historian without illusions. His book is large, but light and comfortable to hold; ex - tremel y informative, but never dull. A shorter book with much the same quality is Robert Kee's Munich, The Eleventh Hour (Hamish Ham - ilton , £ 14.95). As a book to dip into, Bernard Shaw's Col -
JOHN CAMPBELL The biography of the year must be Alastair Home's Har - old Macmillan 1894-1956 (Macmillan, £16.95). This vol - ume only takes him to the door of No 10, but his diary throws new light on one of the unlikeliest careers ever to have been crowned by the premiership. Norman Teb - bit 's Upwardly Mobile (Weid - enfeld & Nicolson, £14.95) narrowly beats Lord Carr - ington 's more gentlemanly reflections for sheer direct - ness . Tony Benn's diary really takes off with volume two, Office Without Power, 1968 - 72 (Hutchinson, £16.95).
POETRY ROBERT NYE Harry Kemp is the real thing — a poet who has gone his own way, indifferent to fame or fashion. The privately printed edition of his Collected Poems has all but sold out, but a copy may still be available from the author at 6 Western Villas, Western Road,i Crediton, Devon EX 17 3NA. I also very much admired Robert Wells's version of The Idylls of Theocritus (Carcanet, £9.95) and was glad to see Philip Larkin's Collected Poems (The Marvell Press/Faber, £16.95).
CLASSICS PETER JONES Adrian Spooner's Lingo (Bris - tol Classical Press, £4.95), a beguiling farrago of Greek myths, cartoons and language games, is the book for any parent or teacher who wants their 11-13 year old to revel in it. G.E.R. Lloyd's The Rev - olution of Wisdom (California, $45) is one of the great contemporary syntheses in the history of ideas: a true classic. It is brilliantly readable.
THEATRE JOHN HIGGINS Kathleen Tynan's biography of her husband was perhaps the most valuable guide to the theatre published last year. Tynan, now out in paperback
(Methuen, £5.95), was not only a portrait of a man far more revealing than one could reasonably expect from a wife, but also a sharp-eyed view of the inside track of London stage and literary life in the Fifties and Sixties. Gerald Clarke's biography Capote (Hamish Hamilton, £16.95) also portrays a man and his time. Capote's end was ugly but his beginning was as bizarre as that of the Holly - wood star he might have been. IRVING WARDLE Volume Four of Shaw's Se - lected Letters (Max Rein - hardt , £30), which completes Dan Laurence's 23-year lab - our , is a bedside book to last a lifetime, and the greatest piece of theatrical editing since Heminges' and Copdell's First Folio. Chekhov Plays, trans - lated and introduced by Mich - ael Frayn (Methuen, £3.95), is another long-term labour of love by Chekhov's best Eng - lish friend, Constance Gar - nett . Vladimir's Carrot, by John Peter (Methuen, £6.95), opens up the theatrical ho - rizon like nothing since the young Eric Bentley.
ART
JOHN RUSSELL TAYLOR The Art of Paul Gauguin, by authors too numerous to men - tion (Little, Brown, £40), would be the perfect desert island book, supposing one could drag such a hefty vol - ume ashore. It began life as the catalogue of a major show, but just as.a picture book it is splendid, and the texts throw floods of light on the art as well as the life. Nearer home, I have much enjoyed Michael Felmingham's The Illustrated Gift Book 1880-1930 (Scolar, £35), which is all about Rack - ham , Dulac, Heath Robinson and, yes, even Mabel Lucie Attwell.
MUSIC PAUL GRIFFITHS Two music books this year stand out for their engaging humanity and inquisitiveness. H.C. Robbins Landon's 1791:
Mozart's Last Year (Thames & Hudson, £12.95) con - fidently disposes of myth and substitutes truth that is, quite properly, stranger. And many of the truths arc prclty slrange that turn up in John TyrrelPs appealingly organized and al - together fascinating Czech Opera (Cambridge, £25).
FOOD/WINE FRANCES BISSELL Stephanie's Feasts and Stories by Stephanie Alexander (Unwin Hyman, £16.95) is a warmly inviting and generous book, from its sunny cover through its richly detailed recipes to the unstinting praise Alexander gives to her peers. Like all good cookery books, it is more than just a celebration of good food; it is a celebration of a place. Alexander lives and cooks in Melbourne, and she joyfully shares with us Austra - lian cooking today. JANE MacQUITTY
Rambling, infuriatingly illogi - cal and from time to time erroneous, Andrew Barr's Wine Snobbery (Faber, £12.95) is nonetheless one of the more enjoyable wine books I have read this year. Dubbed ""an insider's guide to the booze business"", it does its best to expose the seamier side of the wine trade and mostly succeeds. Drilling for Wine by Robin Yapp (Faber Paper - back , £6.95) is just the opp - osite : a highly entertaining, anecdotal dentist - turns - wine - merchant yarn that will appeal to all.
FASHION LIZ SMITH Voguedng into its archives for the History of 20th Century Fashion (Viking, £30), in which Jane Mulvagh skips from stately Edwardian S - bends to the body-skimming Lycra leggings of the Eighties. Sadly, the book lacks colour in both illustration and com - ment . Far more fun and stylish is Nicholas Drake's romp through The Sixties, A Decade in Vogue (Pyramid, £16.95), and Nicholas Cole - ridge 's expose of the intrigues and eccentricities of the busi - ness in The Fashion Conspir - acy (Heinemann, £12.95). For pace, plot and style all are outclassed by Fashion in the French Revolution (Batsford, £14.95), Aileen Ribeiro's co - piously illustrated account of a decade in which the niceties of dress, for either sex, dem - onstrate their shades of pol - itical opinion.
CHILDREN BRIAN ALDERSON Fleeing from a deluge of non - sexist , non-classist , non-racist angst for teenagers, I look refuge in Gabriel Garcia Marquez's ageist Love in the Time of Cholera (Cape, £11.95), and would like to think that that splendid work might give adolescents more to enjoy than the jobs run up for them in the sweatshops of Bloomsbury. For the young who are not yet up to such things, I would like to single out as books of the year the picture book by Sarah Hayes, This is the Bear and the Picnic Lunch, illustrated by Helen Craig (Walker Books, £1.99), and the highly original slory - scquence by Peter Dickinson Merlin Dreams, illustrated by Allen Lee (Gollancz, £9.95).
SCIENCE DAVID JONES Modern logic is a devious and
intricate structure, far re - moved from trite deductions about Socratcs's morality. In Forever Undecided: A Puzzle Guide to Gbdei (Oxford, £5.95), Raymond Smullyan expounds it as a scries of nightmarish fables like Alice's adventures in wonderland. GodcFs crucial Incomplete - ness and Consistency Theo - rems and their corollaries emerge almost naturally, and some recent advances in the subject are lightly sketched. Enthralling, demanding, mind-blowing ; a good way into the subject for students and non-specialists , but should have an index.
ROYALTY HUGO VICKERS Recent episodes of Heir of Sorrows by Silvic Krin (Pri - vate Eye, £2.99) are much subtler' than earlier ones. I relished Love in the Saddle and Born to be Queen, and have been known to amuse/bore my friends with readings. The highlight of every episode of Krirfs latest endeavour is when the hapless Prince recalls the words of his mentor and guru. Sir Laurens van dcr Posl: ""When a man builds a bridge, he must first decide on which side he intends to begin.""
SIIONA CRAWFORD POOLE There arc travel books that explain places brilliantly, such as Jan Morris's Hong Kong (Viking, £14.95). And there are books that do a very good job of describing them. Simon Winchester's Korea, a Walk in the Land of Miracles (Grafton. £12.95) was the pick of this year's bunch. I had no particular interest in going with Eric Hansen on foot across Borneo in Stranger in the Forest (Century Hutchin - son . £12.95). But it turned out to be touchingly more than a young American's tale of sweat and leeches. With him I, too, have been there, done that .
RUSSIA ANDRH NAVROZOV Scenes f om Russian Life, by Vladimir Soloukhin (Peter Owen , £13.95). ""A cigarette after bathing, raspberries with milk, a cucumber with a tiny thread of dill (it should not be removed), here is my political credo,"" wrote Vasily Roz - anov , one of Russia's subtlest thinkers, a few years before his death of hunger in 1919. In the West, with rare exceptions like Emerson, introspection is a cerebral affair ; Russia's contribution to world culture is the use of the heart as a precision instrument.
WILLIAM JACKSON The most important and intellectually satisfying, if not enjoyable, military book of the year was Professor Hinsley's latest volume of the British Intelligence: History of the Second World War (HMSO, £29.95). Through no fault of his team of official historians, it was published when public attention was focused on Spycatclier, and so received far less attention than it deserves. Ii throws new light on the planning thai did so much to win the battles in Normandy, and on the mis - takes made by the Allies that led to the disasters at Arnhcim and in the Ardennes.

Uneasy poetry
It is the obvious music to conclude an ""Armistice Festival"", and in - deed Britten's War Requiem has astonishing moments: the inter - twining of plaintive ""Lacrimosa "" melody with Wilfred Owen's tenderest poem. ""Move him into the sun""; the great gathering of multitudes in the ""Sanctus ""; the lone baritone articulating the shock ending of ""Strange Meet - ing "". Having decided to link Owen with Catholic liturgy, Brit - ten was too canny a dramatist not to exploit the uneasy mutual resonances. But any pacifist who sets out to honour the war dead is going to be in a curious intellectual position. There is a feeling of woolly ambiguity, if not actual duplicity, about a work which asks ""what passing-bells for those who die as cattle?"" , and then supplies the bells, the trumpets, the mourning choirs, indeed the full panoply of a pompous state funeral , with its inbuilt implication that there is some point in dying for your country after all. Britten here seems to be diluting the uncom - promising message of this great poetry of anger.
War Requiem Festival Hall
Perhaps that explains the un - even musical inspiration. There is a contrived aspect to the heavily pictorial chamber-orchestra writ - ing ; and large chunks of the ""Dies irac"" simply fail to depict vividly either the Catholic conception of Judgement Day or Owen's vision of Armageddon in Flanders. The work also needs an at - mospheric venue. With the cham - ber orchestra squashed against the main forces, and the boys' choir in an unresonant doorway, this performance, directed by Sir David Willcocks. lacked that ambience. Yet there were many fine things: immaculately tuneful singing by the St Paul's Cathedral choristers, some excellent brass playing from the Philharmonia and strongly characterized solo singing from Sheila Armstrong, Philip Langridge and Stephen Roberts. The well-drilled Bach Choir of - fered a stunning pianissimo in the ""Kyrie"" and ""Pie Jesu""; the orchestra overpowered them at the ""Libera me"" climax, but perhaps it should.

The Jungle Latchmere, Battersea
quietly spoken, thoroughly under - stood poem about death. ""Black March"" puts the grey visitor in sombre guise , whereas ""Angel Boly"" is ghoulish murder, in which the balance between a lip - smackin g relish for batty exag - geration and a stony taste in the mouth is brilliantly sustained by poet and performers to the end. Jane Downs and Sarah Cahn play the older, more reflective voices; Jacquetta May and Cath - erine Thornborrow the lolloping young ones. Sarah Harper's fluent direction develops each scene from some minor item of its prede - cessor , and only near the end stirs the incidents into a muddle.

Devised by the performers and director for a company with the user-friendly name of Buster The - atre , the show is performed against a setting that is partly suburban (presumably Palmers Green), partly Douanier Rousseau. Brightest feature on stage is the doorway under the stairs, painted to represent a colossal tiger's snarling jaws —though , curiously, the acted version of the poetry featuring jungle terrors is the least successful. The imagery here calls on traditional fears, masked by traditional silly-assery . The company's training in swift changes of mood, lithe movement and bold expressions brings best results when a sense of vague alarm builds to something defi - nitely scary (locked in a cellar, punitive games) and climaxes in a

""I was much further out than you thought,"" explains the dead man in Stevie Smith's best known poem, ""and not waving but drown - ing ."" As a quick , sharp self - portrait of desperation, the last four words are hard to beat. The temptation to include them in a show created from her poetry must have been difficult to resist, but the decision to leave them out is correct, since the just - discern - ible storyline on which the poems are threaded is quasi - autobio - graphical . Four actresses play Stevie Smith's heroines, weaving her unmistakable verbal pattern of quirky , cocky, narcotic images , and the irruption of a male narrative voice would make a nasty hole in the web.

"Davalle, Peter",Poetry before wicket,The Times,1988-Aug-10,"London, England","Poetry before wicket
( RADIO ^ V CHOICE J I have no patience with cricket and even less with anyone who is obsessed by it — bottom of my list of favourite friends is one who cannot carry on a conversation with - out sporadically giving an impression of someone at the wicket, knocking an invisible ball for six — so I approached John Latham's play Heavy Roller (Radio 4,3.00pm) with deep misgivings. Skip (Clive Swift), ageing captain of the village cricket team, is so far gone about the game that he once powdered over the dis - figuring measles of one of his team so that he could fulfil a fixture . He bought his home because it commanded a view of the cricket pitch, fills his house with catch-practising equipment, and wakes up the family at 6am by perfecting his off-drives m the hall. Small wonder his daughter has little
time for him and his wife is packing her bags. You would infer from all this that Heavy Roller is a comedy. It isn't . It is, in fact, a drama shot ' through with poetry. Skip knows when to bring on his spinners because of the ""swoop of brown seeds in the
wind"" that tells him how the turf is drying out, and on humid days, the sawdust he sprinkles across the crease clings to his fingers ""like lost children"". Perhaps cricket writers use images like this, too. If they do, then I could be tempted to scan the sports pages of The Times. After Simon (Radio 4, 11.00am), Marjorie Loft - house 's report on MPS disease in children, is not one of your medical miracle stories. Youngsters continue to die from MPS, families continue to be shattered by it, and doctors have to be satisfied with improving palliative treatment because there is still no cure.

""Every decade of a mans life has its own for tunes, its own hopes, its own desires."" And, if the man is a poet ,— he might have added — its own poetry . * In First Lines Jon Stallworthy has given us a remarkable, valuable anthology of those early imagi - , native efforts which posterity, un - : mindful of Goethe 's words, brands with the term ""juvenilia "".

Yet in addi - tion it allows the anthologist to uncover the fortunes, hopes and .desires of those forgotten decades 'in the lives of poets, the ""early years"" often glossed over in their biographies or edited out of their collected works.

Precise and confident, they are the work of hands which, to quote Novalis's definition of poetry, can heal the wounds in - flic ted by reason.

In his introduction the editor recalls young Mozart ; the parallel could be developed further. It often seems that , in its baroque and classical youthful phases , the Euro - pean musical tradition was quite incapable of producing anything bad; it was not until the romantic composers began their assault on the human soul that the bad took its place beside the sublime. Within the scope of this analogy it may be held that no poem in this book is
bad, for none of the poets is as yet old enough to attempt anything that could bring about such an outcome . In other words, these are poets in the baroque and classical periods of their lives. Where they went from there is another story. The Victorians seem to have had an easy time under - standing themselves. Charlotte Bronte, we learn, wrote more than half of her poems between the ages of 13 and 20, noting at 24: ""At this age it is time that... a few at least of the countless illusions of youth should be cleared away."" Tennyson
would have approved: he com - posed ""an epic of 6,000"" when he was 12. Not so in our century. James Joyce's first poems, collected in Chamber Music, were also his last : prose , then as now, seemed the more solid foundation for a writ - er s career. In my view, English lost one of its finest poets: Shy thoughts and grave wide eyes a fid Jtands That wander as they list — The twilight turns to darker blue With lights of amethyst.
T.S. Eliot's life choices were even harder. The 16-year-old 's ""Lyric"" already contains traces of what Peter Ackroyd has diagnosed as his later sycophantic academi - cism : Time and Space , capitalized , appear in the first line. ""My English master ,"" Eliot proudly recalled, ""was much impressed and asked whether I had had any help from some elder person."" No, one imagines him replying, I am quite old myself, thank you.

'Accroche Note Almeida
The Pascal Dusapin recital given by 'Accroche Note, which I men - tioned briefly yesterday, in - troduced us not only to a remarkable composer but also to a quite extraordinarily sharp group of musicians, well up to the feats of virtuosity and exasperated inten - sity this music requires. Perhaps the most astonishing piece .was Itou, for bass clarinet, which winds up in the tentative, weakly supported treble of the instrument and ends with a beautifully hollow, hollowly beautiful sequence of harmonics: Armand Angster was the player, as also of the more punchy If for regular clarinet The other piece that stood out in this hour of fierce energies was II -
M - ko for unaccompanied soprano, a hurried recitative and a work which, as the composer tellingly puts it, ""does not know whether it should be spoken or sung"". Fran - coise Kubler wavered in these borderlands to captivating effect, as she did again in the new Anacoluthe for voice, contrabass clarinet and double bass, a strug - gle for sense that makes one look forward with keen anticipation to the opera on which Dusapin is working with the poet of this piece, Olivier Cadiot . A second recital by the same group featured pieces by Fran - coise - Bemard Mache, and in particular a stimulating group of works close to the primitive. Jean - Michel Collet gave cracking performances of the drum piece Kemit and of Phenix for vibra - phone and tom-toms ; Kubler sang a postulated Hittite incantation with conviction and simplicity.

f radio ^ V CHOICE J ® Kaleidoscope (Radio 4, 4.30pm) was in a particularly enterprising mood when it decided what to do about the Literature as Celebration con - ference in Dun Laoghaire a fortnight ago. Cocking a snook at Auden for saying that poetry makes nothing happen, it detached from the con - ference a clutch of eminent poets and put them in front of the microphone to discuss what it is like for outsiders (a Russian , a St Lucian, an Australian , and an Irishman) to operate within the same
linguistic culture (English). The result is a stimulating rebuttal of the calumny, put about by prose writers, that when poets sit round a table, things go from bad to verse. There is a welcome down - to - earthness about Joseph Brod - sky , Derek Walcott, Les Murray and Seamus Heaney. And chairman Michael Schm - i dt ensures that it stays that way . Heaney, in particular, knows how to answer those who say they can't get the hang of poetry. In writing, he says , it is what you can hear and reproduce that matters, rather than what you can speak.
""Writing is, m one way, unspeakable."" Heaney thinks Murray has the same kind of disobedient energy as Auden. Agree with him or not, there is much to chew on in his theory about the return to favour of rhyming poetry. He says the
public used to let poets get away with free verse because the Bible used it, but now that few read the Scriptures, they prefer their verse to be rhymed .

"Peachment, Chris",A modest literary life,The Times,1988-Jun-11,"London, England","Autobiography is an area in which writers tend to be self-centred . Alan Ross is the exception to the rule, writes Chris Peachment A lan Ross wants his two volumes of autobio - graphy , Blindfold Games and Coastwise Lights (the latter pub - lished this week) to be seen as the raw material from which he began to write poetry, and only incident - ally autobiographical. He is being unduly modest, because they are more than the prosaic pretext for the poems which stud the books. This second volume is also in part a fascinating history of metropolitan literary life from the end of the war, when Ross was demobbed from the navy (Able Seaman, Russian Con - voys ), through the Soho and Fitzrovia set of the late Forties, past the more recherche figures of
the Fifties, such as Julian Mac - laren - Ross and Henry Green, and up to the Sixties, when he edited the London Magazine. It is also a collection of character sketches of people he has known; he writes most tenderly about painters such as John Minton and Keith Vaughan. So where, to echo Roy Campbell, is the bloody horse? The answer to that is: in every single well-chosen word. Ross might not be elbowing his way to the foreground as is the practice in much modern autobiography, but nevertheless a picture emerges of a perceptive man, with a rare liking for his fellow men, a strong interest in cricket and horses, and a fine prose style. One wonders why he had not been a novelist.
""I did try once,"" he says, ""but without much conviction. It al - ways seems extraordinary to me how, out of all the multifarious things that happens to you, a no v - elist can settle on one subject and turn it into a book. The war was tremendous for someone like me; it gave you a subject gift-wrapped .""
His shipboard adventures, in - cluding being sealed alone in the forward magazine of a sinking ship with a hose pipe to play on the glowing metal, are expertly told in the first volume, Blindfold Games. But while at sea, ""all I wanted to do when I got ashore again was to head for Soho. The grand life, that others.dreamed of, never appealed."" He maintains that Soho was at its greatest just before the end of the war, after which most of the people went off to find jobs, leav - ing only the most fuddled of hangers-on still cadging drinks at the bar. Julian Maclaren-Ross , who was the model for the exper - imental novelist X. Trapnel in Anthony Powell's Dance to the Music of Time sequence, was an enemy of promise. ""He should have been tremendously success - ful . He was very gifted. He had an enormous memory for the di - alogue of all the films he had seen, and would have made a good scriptwriter. But everything in
him was failure. He would take 10 advances from different publish - ers , and therefore be unable to publish with any of them, because the other nine would be wanting their money back. His fur coat and his cane, all that/o//e de grandeur would have been fine if he had found someone to look after him, and give him a sense of worth."" R oss was more fond of Henry Green, whose strange gerund-titled novels {Living, Loving, Doting , Ending ) go in and out of fashion. ""His father ran a small industrial firm, and for most of his life Henry made fun of him shuffling about the office moving a piece of paper from desk to desk. But then when Henry inherited the firm, he just couldn't make a go of it, and drank himself to death in no time. He had been such a handsome, dandyish man, but by the end he looked like a tramp. It was very sad."" Ross had long been friendly with painters and illustrators, and
the sale of some carefully bought works of art enabled him to buy a race horse. ""In 20 years, I won about 30 races so it just about paid its way and was great fun. It cost about £5,000 a year to stable and train a horse, so if you win a couple of races then it will pay its way. Nowadays though, there are very few small British owners left. It's .the sort of hobby that was possible then, but no longer."" His other great passion was cricket, and if a man could write that England never lost a Test series throughout his career as the Observer 's cricket correspondent then he can justly boast of having lived through a Golden Age. Nowadays, he devotes himself solely to editing the London Magazine, which he does single - handed from a shed in the back garden in South Kensington. It has an enviable record of introducing new writers to the public, and he can claim William Boyd and Graham Swift, among others, as
recent proteges
The life of small magazines, how - ever , does not become easier with the passing of time : ""The Arts Council has been very generous in the past, but 1 suspect that every - thing soon will have to be self - sup - porting . When I began in 1960 a phone call to Chatto or Faber or OUP would guarantee an advert - isement being placed simply be - cause they thought it was a respon - sible thing to do. Nowadays, some accountant bleats something about ""cost-effectiveness"" and so they don't do it. Now people are talking about sponsorship, but sponsors always want a box at the theatre or a seat at Lords. Not much mileage in a literary magazine."" It is iniquitous that one has to keep reminding people, in these Thatcherite times, that there are some activities which should never be judged by the size of their wallet.

"Holmes, Richard",Canto for Old Ez,The Times,1988-Jun-02,"London, England","Big new life ofthe tricky Master of Modernism and many masks
Canto for OldEz
Pound is the man they put in the cage at Pisa on a charge of high treason (1944), and then awarded the first Bollingen Prize for Poetry (1949). He was, in every sense, a difficult case: political crank and poetic genius, who continues to inspire both reverence and con - t empt , as brilliantly demonstrated in the present biography. I remem - ber the first time I heard Old Ez (on a private tape spirited out from Italy) he wasn't broadcasting Fascist propaganda, or reciting the Cantos. He was reading , in a wonderful crackerbarrel - corncob - Kentucky voice, the stories of Brer Rabbit to his grandchildren. I was completely enthralled (aged 12 ), but saw even then it was an act, a magical nutcase performance. Later I fell in love with the poetry (""Provincia Deserta"" changed my life); and later still fell out with all the crazy economics and ""gargling anti-Semitism"" . A fairly typical experience, I should think. '! Humphrey Carpenter, one of the most fluent and intelligent of modern biographers, (Tolkien and Auden), would probably see a pattern in this. ""Brer Rabbit"" , he
writes, ""is a perennial trickster, especially resourceful in adver - sity ."" This turns out to be his commanding image of Ezra Pound, an ""agile and slippery cfeature"" , who could never be quite caught ""by the tail"". In each phase of his work, Pound has ""merely cast off another skin and slipped away, leaving one clutch - ing just a persona or mask"". In this vast biography, Car pen - ter pursues his protean prey at epic lgngth and with massive docu - men tation , through 900 pages of endlessly fascinating research. Pound's trickster masks include the troubadour lover, the Whistler dimdy, the P.T. Barnum show - man , the Confucian sage, Dr Pound the learned economist and anti-Semite , the Last Ant from the broken European ant-heap (that's Pisa), Old Gampaw Ez the certi - fied nutter, and lastly King Lear of the ""silent"" years at Rapallo.
-But the tone is set by Carpen - ter 's relentless scepticism about all these roles. He writes in a key passage describing Pound's 13 years incarceration at St Eliza - beth ' s asylum: ""To play the noble sufferer , the maligned but un - complaining sage, the wise man in the madhouse , offered far more potential than that ofthe elderly and not very popular poet still exiled in a Europe that had seen the defeat of his ideas."" He is equally sceptical about the value of much of the poetry, seeing fSound. as essentially an editor - translator of other men's work — whether Bertran de Born, Li Po, or T ,S. Eliot . "" What we have, then, is a major biography of one of the greatest and most controversial figures of Modernism, which is severely reductionist in its effect The title is a layered irony. It is an epic that produces a shrunken, splintered
anti-hero ; and one reads it with both admiration and a curious sense of dismay. Technically, it is a formidable achievement of vivid foreground narrative. The early years in London and Paris, with their glittering, cast-list of Eliot, Lewis, Ford, Joyce, Lawrence , and Hemingway, are presented with spirit and mockery. New corres - pondence with Eliot (the Possum), and Pound's parents, give a superb picture of Pound the generous promoter and eccentric nuisance, forever creating some new Vortex. The middle period in Italy, of Social Credit theory and Fascism, is handled with sharp polemicism, and the Cantos are indicted for their chaotic obscurity, of ten ""infuriatingly incomprehensible"". Much play is made of the battier ideas — Eleusi' nian sexual mys - teries , or the brain as a ""Great Clot of Genital Fluid"". There is new material on the involved and rather tragic triangle with Dorothy Pound and Olga Rudge. The episode of Pound in the US Army Detention cage at Pisa (like something out of Dante), is a triumph of biographical reconstruction; though characteristically the Pisan Cantos
A SERIOUS CHARACTER The Life of Ezra Pound By Humphrey Carpenter Faber, £20
— with their infinitely moving ""Ode on Vanity"" — are interpreted not as tragic repentance, but as merely another crafty mask. ""The tone may be regretful, but there is not the slightest ideological shift"" Many readers, like me, may find this hard to accept: The anfs a centaur in his dragon world. Pull down thy vanity, it is not man Made courage , or made order , or made grace. Pulldown thy vanity , I say pull down. Learn ofthe green world what can be thy place In scaled invention or true artistry .. .(Canto81). The legal and psychiatric argu - ments over Pound's indictment for treason are explored very critically and at great length. Carpenter concludes, convinc - ingly , that there was a conspiracy of experts to certify Pound; but describes the poet's own enigmatic position rather harshly, with much emphasis on the crazier ""acolites etc."". He seems unaware of the immense good work done by true
Poundian disciples and poets like Peter Whigham (my own teacher), William Cookson, and Peter Rus - sell — who ""made it new"" for so many young writers. His account of the final years of the "" demi - god "" , using fine interviews ob - tained by Donald Hall, D.G. Bridson of the BBC, and Allen Ginsberg, is alone touched by a certain nobility. Ginsberg — ""The Buddhist Jew"" {his own descrip - tion ) — formally blessing Pound in a Venetian restaurant for ""the series of practical exact language models scattered through the Can - tos like stepping-stones"" which had inspired him, produces a rare touch ofthe comic sublime. So how does one balance the scales? Humphrey Carpenter has certainly superseded the genial but over-protective portrait given by Noel Stock in 1970 . Our view of Pound is enormously sharpened
and clarified. But for all this, I think there is a failure, a fore - shortening , ofthe literary perspec - tive . Pound was not merely ""a broken bundle of mirrors"". He was a bold , large, symbolic (and hugely American) figure, eccentric to the point of madness, but fulfilling a public and historic role in the tragedy of 20th-century Europe which is almost unique among Anglo-Saxon writers of our time. The scale ofthe comparison is with men like Andre Malraux, or Mayakovsky — rather than with Brer Rabbit. Moreover the in - fluence of his poetry — from Cathay to the Cantos — has been astonishingly fruitful. Modernism is inconceivable without Pound. It may not ""all cohere"" {in Pound's regretful words), but it has sung and shone. I rather like Heming - way 's parting shot: ""Of course Ezra is an ass, but he has written damn lovely poetry.""

"Nye, Robert",Live news from elsewhere,The Times,1988-Mar-10,"London, England","Live news from
Poetry, by tradition variously defined , is the personal account of what it is like to be alive. Who says so? The poet Harry Kemp says so, in - troducing his own Collected Poems (available from the author at 6 Western Villas, Western Road, Crediton, Devon, EX 17 3NA) with an essay full of good shrewd things about poetry in general and Laura Riding in particular. Kemp once collaborated with Riding, most gifted and original of 20th-century poets. His first poems were pub - lished in Epilogue, that "" Criti - cal Summary"" edited by her and Robert Graves in the Thirties. Now, at the age of 76, he is the only one still left alive of that small distinguished company to whom Riding was once the Muse. The others, true poets all, Graves , Nor - m a n Cameron , James Reeves, Alan Hodge, have received varying degrees of public recognition for their work, but Kemp has been unaccount - ably neglected, a state of affairs exemplified by the fact that his life's work now comes forth in a privately printed
edition. Books of such prov - enance are usually ignorable. This one is not, having lines like these entitled ""Catalpa "" in it: The tree of heaven is the last to leaf. After the oak, weeks later than may or beech. I have watched cautiously as pressure built Within the steel-grey buds, while daffodil And white bell flower and wilt: Like one reluctant ever to spill Or improvise happiness , or break From precarious silence into speech .
^^mj^^^M SJ^^^^
Kemp learned from Riding a seriousness about words and their ways which seems to have left him reluctant to break his own precarious si - lence , but the best of these poems not only have the necessary pressure of that reluctance behind them, but are themselves not unlike the leaves of the catalpa according to one of the citations in the Oxford English Dictionary: ""Remarkably simple and heart shaped"". Which is to say that here is a poet whose work, packed with hard thought at one with strong feeling, strikes me as thoroughly modem in idiom, yet just as thoroughly part of the great tradition of English poetry in both manner and matter. Look again at his definition of poetry. Did it seem commonplace? In fact, imply -
ing as it does that poetry is not an art but a special mode of knowledge, it is actually more strange and accurate than Matthew Arnold's moralistic notion that poetry had better be a ""criticism of life"" . or Wordsworth's somewhat im - potent fantasy of it as ""emo - tion recollected in tranquillity"" . Kemp 's per - sonal account of what it is like to be alive comes across as individual poems trying to find words for states of mind and feeling all but beyond them, verbal homes for. a homelessness of spirit which gets comfort only from its own profession: We who for what if's worth are adept At saying several things'at once — Content as trees in this; . Whose manifold leaves and branches Ape our structured words and thought — Are rooted nonetheless In singleness of heart, ' Being sprung from seed our Muse Planted in moonlight and laughter And watered with her tears.
From the casual self-appraisal of the first two lines to ;the unrhetorical visionary exact - ness of the last two, with what comes between all magical thinking-through-metaphor , this is surely the right real thing — something quirky, honest, and singular, yet said with such grace and force that one feels the less alone for hearing it, and will not forget it having heard it said. Harry Kemp, plainly a lucky misfit in the world of contemporary poetry, and even luckier per - haps to have been a slow and late developer in that world where poetry is more than contemporary, deserves and will reward the attention of all who persist in looking to poems for unique news of what it is like to be alive. ,

Frances Horovitz: Poet, A Symposium, edited by Brocard Sewell (Ay)esford, £6.90)
At long last posterity is removing its dust sheets from the work of Frances Horovitz. What is uncovered is a poetry that
shrinks academic criticism to dwarfish appraisals, and reviewers' prose to mere stam - mered gratitude. One should just quote ""In Painswick Churchyard"" , for instance, in which the poet watches her young child at play: He picnics among tombs — pours imaginary tea, a yew tree his kitchen ""You will live with me in my house"". Oh could I believe the living and dead inhabit one house under the sky and you my child run into yourfuture forever . The quality of these poems —several of which are re - pri nted in this symposium — has to do with rare indefinables: a certain tone, a spindly charm, or what Fleur Adcock, writing about 20th - century women's poetry in general , has called ""a kind of sparkle "". But Adcock omitted her from the recent Faber Book of Twentieth Century Women's Poetry (despite the fact that Horovitz, born in 1938, was well within the book's cut-off date of 1945) and her Col - lected Poems of 1985 (Bloodaxe) went largely un - noticed . And yet a few of these poems are better than any - thing published here in the last decade. Frances Horovitz died in 1983 from cancer of the ear, and this book opens with an account of the frail, stunted tenure of her 45 years. She started writing soon after her marriage , in 1964, to the jazz - poet Michael Horovitz. She appears to have spent little time at the flimsy altars of that decade: her poems are unruffled by the seethe of events or by the sub-Ginsberg shrillness of so much writing around her. She was left alone,
able to meditate on ""loving and the seepage of our lives"" , able to respond to the humili - ations of long-term illness with amazing tranquillity: ""Thin as a swan's bone/1 wait for the lessons of pain and light"". She seems not to have wrestled with death but to have gently, tearlessly tussled with it: ""There I was all those years trying to lose half a stone,"" she told Jane Percival from her bed, , ""and now I'd give anything to put on three stone."" Elegies, like shrines , have to produce significances beyond the sadness of their occasions. Only two of the poems printed here (by Anne Stevenson and Penelope Shuttle) do that, and none of them can do proper homage to Horovitz 's own writing. The Collected Poems are, after all , what we are left with, when all the symposia and elegies have withered. One is reminded, gratefully, of John Updike's appreciation of Wal - lace Stevens: ""What a good use of life, to leave behind one beautiful book.""

Harry Fainlight was a rare spirit who may just possibly have been the Coleridge of our age. Like Coleridge, bis life seemed rained by addictions; but, his principal addiction being to poetry, bis life is now his poems , and these are by no means ruinous.

If it is true that each generation discovers its own appropriate medium, then surely this is an age of prose: fiction is flourish - ing while poetry has become something of a sideshow, conve - niently used as a signal for ""deep "" feeling by certain Irish poets, but otherwise seen as a piece of candyfloss to fill spaces in the columns of the weeklies, or as a publicity stunt, or as a springboard for some other kind of literary career. It takes an anthology such as this, therefore , to remind us of what ought not to be forgotten — prose may be the more difficult art, but poetry is the higher, the only discipline that can really save language from corruption and mis - use . Poets are indeed the un - acknowledged legislators of mankind, since poetry offers the only language that can in the end reshape the world. This is not a polemical anthology on the old model, however, since, as its title suggests, the poets collected
in this volume represent a group only iii a chronological sense — most of them began writing in the Sixties, and the vast bulk of the poetry here was composed within the last 15 years. If it represents any kind of reaction it is not against the fashionable poets of the moment (who will in any case die of inanition sooner rather than later) but rather against the whole context of English poetry which prevailed when these particular writers began to publish their work — a reaction, in other words, against the ortho - doxy of the Fifties and Sixties when this ""right little, tight little island"", to borrow a Victorian phrase, produced right little, tight little poems. It was a time of insularity and of an almost wilful Philistinism, when English poets, believing that they had nothing to learn from the great modernists of a previous generation, fashioned a style that was at once parochial and out - moded — characteristically dealing with what were considered to be the

A VARIOUS ART Edited by Andrew Crozier and TimLongville Carcanet. £12 .95 more ""ordinary]' emotions, as if that were some kind of riposte to the pioneering work of Pound, Eliot and even Auden. It represented an aesthetic of narrow forms, narrow cadences , and an even narrower idea Of poetry, which reached its apotheosis in the work of Philip Larkin. This is not to say that such verse was necessarily barren or inconsequential; at its best it had the virtues of good prose chopped up into conveniently smaller lines. But it did mark a time when English poetry entered a kind of self -
imposed retreat. So what does this anthology offer instead? The context in which these poets operate may itself be of some significance. They have all been distributed in what would once have been called ""small magazines"" and by small publishers; but if they have been ignored by the metropoli - tan publishing houses, they have been equally overlooked by the national press (with the honourable exception of The London Review oj Books , which has included long articles on at least three of the poets represented in this volume). This is no doubt in part because some of these poets are not readily com - prehensible to the casual reader, but
it should be pointed out that those writers who never go beyond the inherited dispensation of language are unlikely to make progress of any other kind. And that, after all, is the main point: as Andrew Crozier says in his introduction, ail these poets share a ""commitment to the discov - ery of meaning and form -in lan - guage itself. In fact, some of them ought already to be well known — J.H. Prynne , for example , is wi th - out doubt the most formidable and accomplished poet in England to - day , a writer who has single - han d e d l y changed the vocabulary of expression , and who, through his teaching at Cambridge, has re - educated the sensibility of an entire generation of students. Then there are younger poets here, too, such as Iain Sinclair and Nick Totton, who have in very different ways re - defined the possibilities of political or ""public"" poetry at a time when it has fallen into disrepute .
Some of the writers in this anthology have been connected with Cambridge University — in a way they represent the fastidious distaste for metropolitan fashion with characterizes that place — but it, would be wrong to label the collection as in any way academic. There are poets here, like John James or Tim Longville, who manage to bring into the cadences of their verse a quite new range of urban imagery and popular meta - phor — and they often do so through the medium of a direct, speaking voice. It is appropriate, too, that a number of long poems have been included — Douglas Oliver's ""In the Cave of Suicession"" [sic] and Iain Sinclair's ""Lud Heat"", for example, are two works that really create new forms of narrative poetry. What is most significant about this collection, then, is the enlarge - ment of the possibilities of poetry that it represents; to read it is to experience a rare sensation of
freedom , since within the space of something fewer than 400 pages a range of wholly new concerns can be seen to enter the sphere of poetic language. As a result, there are poets here whose work could redefine the world of any reader- interested enough to pick up this anthology in the first place. Of course, there are dissimilarities of tone and of mean - ing — in many ways this is as disparate a collection as anyone is likely to find — but what all these poets share is an attention to language so profound that the words
themselves draw them forward into new areas of meaning and connota - tion .

/ ^ TELEVISION > V CHOICE J 9 The Second World War may not have produced poetry of the calibre of Wilfred Owen's or Siegfried Sassoon's but it did inspire many or - dinary men and women who were not normally poets to break into verse. Soldiers, sailors, airmen and nurses drew their inspiration from the special stresses of war and the results were often remark - able . War Poets of' 39 (BBC2, 7.15pm), in the Open Space series, draws on more than 10,000 poems, collected by the Oasis Trust under a former Daily Mirror journalist, Vic - tor Selwyn. Some are jolly, as when a housewife expresses pride that her pots and pans have helped to make a Hurri - cane . Others are moving and poignant, laments for the fallen like a nurse's dedication to the man she loved. Yet more are cynical , bitter and angry, chipping away at the myth that between 1939 and 1945 Britain was one big, happy, united family. This is the unofficial history of the
Second World War, the con - flict as seen from the grass roots . The poems are in - troduced by Spike Milligan (who wrote his first serious verse as a young gunner) and General Sir John Hackett and performed by four actors, Paul McGann , Irene Richard, Paul Jesson and Neil Dudgeon. This may sound more like radio than television. But the producer, Peter Lee-Wright ,
had the imaginative idea of presenting his actors not just as readers but as characters, putting them in appropriate uniforms and setting them against stylised studio back - drops of Greece or Cassino or the African desert. With vivid use of colour and lighting, the fusion of word arid image works splendidly.

Under the Banyan Tree, by R.K. Narayan (King Penguin, £2.95) In one of the gentle stories in this collection, an estranged husband and wife meet while sheltering from a storm under the wide, dark leaves of the banyan tree. Their emotions entangle, their communication fails, and the woman rushes from her husband's desperate attempt to make contact to disappear behind a ""curtain of raindrops"". The tales, linked by a strange and convincing pattern of affinities and contrasts, draw on folk lore, fairytale, and simple anecdote to create condensed vignettes of human
experience. Each dwells on a different facet of human weak - ness , whether it is limited understanding of others, lit - eral or metaphorical blind - ness , fear, greed, or physical weakness. Imaginary Friends, by Alison Lurie (Abacus, £3.95) A sociology professor and his young colleague set off for the remote town of Sophis to investigate the behavioural patterns of a small group of spiritual anomalies, the Truth Seekers, which, through the medium of the voluptious Verena, claims to be receiving verbal communication from the plant of Varna. The narrator is the matter -

As he notes, with a ludicrous attention to detail, the members of the group stripping down to their nylon underpants in a ritual burning of natural fibres, and, with hot-under-the-collar anxiety, the breathy advances of the entranced Verena, his factual prose becomes charged with irony. The sociological investiga - tion is turned on its head as, losing the distinction between truth and fiction, the two teachers become victims of their own survey.

Both rhythmically and melodically, the writing seemed particularly dull here. And throughout the cycle there was too much recourse to literal and regular repetition of brief ideas for no good reason.

There were glimpses of playing of higher quality in Haydn's ""Drum Roll"" Sym - phony , No 103, and in Stravinsky's Petrushka, given in its version of 1911, though still the latter could have done with a coat or two of European Community Youth Orchestra gloss.

Robert Frost once actually defined poetry as ""what gets lost in translation."" There is truth in that, of course, for a poem nearly always happens somewhere close to the roots of any given language. The better the poem, the harder to trans - late or transplant it Hearts are easier. To say that a thing is impossible, though, is not to say that it should not be tried. Elaine Feinstein's versions of Tsvetayeva seem to me to give an English reader a real chance to acquaintance with one of the most interesting and peculiar of 20th-century Rus - sian poets: / know the truth — give up alt other truths! No need for people anywhere on earth to struggle Look — it is evening, look, it is nearly night: what do you speak of, poets, lovers, generals? The wind is level now, the
earth is wet with dew, the storm of stars in the sky will turn to quiet. And soon all of us will sleep under the earth, we who never let each other sleep above it. This is effective because it seems to be thinking and feeling its way into being as it goes along in English, while remaining as true as possible to its Russian original . Miss Feinstein has kept in mind a remark of Octavio Paz's con - cerning the ""transformation "" of a poem from one language to another, and she reports in her own notes here on an occasion - al experience of suddenly hav - in g the sense of ""writing the poem itself, freshly , as though for the first time.""

At all points I
was reminded of a marvellous sentence which I came across in a letter she wrote to Rilke: ""I do not live in my lips, and he who kisses me misses me."" That is the heart of Marina Tsvetayeva, and Elaine Feinstein conies close to it. Roy Fuller has it in common with Tsvetayeva that he is a passionate, formalist.

"Navrozov, Andrei",The cliquish Muse in a mortarboard,The Times,1987-Jan-29,"London, England","The cliquish Muse in a mortarboard
In her introduction to this anthology, Helen Vendler dwells on the contrast between British and American poetry, reminding us that her home - land was an enormous wilder - ness only recently settled, educationally and ethnically diverse, with a poetry that was bound to be diffuse, heteroge - neous . This, of course, is a truism. According to the US Cen - sus , in the sample year 1900 12 million (or roughly 16 per cent) of a total population of 76.3 million were "" foreign - born "". One may wonder whether this admixture made that much of a difference in a country whose culture was dominated by a native elite. But let us assume that such a measure of cultural diversity is significant. Of a total of 23 living poets anthologized by Miss Vendler, 17 (or roughly 74 per cent) are
professors at American col - leges and universities. May not one assume that this measure of cultural uniformi - ty is just as significant? In fact, is it not astonishing that an editor so visibly preoccupied with ""diversity"" should be so blatantly cliquish in her choices? Whatever America is or may have been, The Faber Book of Contemporary Ameri - can Poetry, is about as ""diffuse"" as an IQ test, and as ""heterogeneous"" as a KKK picnic. The history of self-serving misidentification of poetic practice with academic rou - tine in the US began with the publication in 1938 of Under - standing Poetry by Cleanth Brooks and Robert Penn War - ren (still in print after four editions), although Louis Untermeyer's Modern Ameri - can Poetry (now in its seventh edition) had flirted with the
THE FABER BOOK OF CONTEMPO - RARY AMERICAN POETRY Edited by Helen Vendler Faber, £9.95
notion as early as 1919. Adopted as standard texts by US colleges and universities, these books shaped the Ameri - can intellectual's perception of poetry as a subject of academ - ic analysis for generations. When Untermeyer's anthol - ogy first appeared, a bitter Basil Bunting spoke propheti - cally of the coming of ""the age of poetry for commentators."" More recently, the academic canon was expanded and up - dated when Donald Allen's
New American Poetry 1 945 - 1960 , currently a common university text, was published in I960. Thus Miss Vendler's anthology is but the last of many steps towards an Ivy League orthodoxy of poetic expression and critical discus - sion in what Peter Quartermain has called ""the history of the politics of poetry"" in America. This lat - est endeavour ought to have been entitled The Conformist's Book of Contem - p orar y Academic Verse , al - though , from the commercial point of view, How To Get Tenure: The New American Poet's Guide might have been rather more successful. Ac - cordingly , Miss Vendler's "" In - troduction : Contemporary American Poetry"" contains every critical platitude an aspiring academic poet needs to win the approval of his peers.
Consider poets who are women"" . In the old days, Miss Vendler laments, their poetry ""was limited both in subject (love, God, children, death) and in expression."" But today, she exults: ""Art , race relations, cultural mythology, meta - physics are now available subjects for any younger woman."" The tone of this juxtaposition reminds one of Soviet guides conducting tours of the Tolstoy estate at Yasnbaya Polyana, near Tula, who explain to visitors that while in the old days there was but one writer, Count Tolstoy, today there are hundreds of writers in the Tula region. But never mind the chatter about ""available subjects"" (does Miss Vendler really bejieve that, as a poet, Rita Dove is more free to discuss anything, including ""art"" , in 1980 than Emily Dickinson was in 1807?). The unforgiv -
able thing is Miss Vendler's deliberate exclusion of women whose achievement is at least as great as, say, that of Elizabeth Bishop (d. 1979) - Djuna Bernes (d. 1982); Ba - bette Deutsch (d. 1982);or Laura Riding, for instance - yet who are outside the aca - demic poet's purview. As for the men, the unforgivable omission is Anthony Hecht - in my opinion the only big name of contemporary Ameri - can poetry bound to endure — although the absence of Rich - ard Eberhart is at least as puzzling. And - if diversity is so important — where is Jo - seph Brodsky? ""The poets included here"" , Miss Vendler warns, write ""from [sic] a Freudian culture, one in which a vaguely Freud - ian model of the soul has replaced an older Christian - ized Hellenic model."" A mod -
ern - day car salesman would be more subtle. ""This Buick Sky - lark is not for everyone"", he would purr. By contrast, Miss Vendler, with the combined cultural power of America's academic establishment be - hind her, pitches Freud the old Detroit way: ""The model of the soul you can't afford to miss."" In reality, of course, one can be just as pedestrian describ - ing a sunset one sees as a sunset one dreams about. But unlike its quaintly old - fash - ioned predecessors, Miss Vendler's model of the soul exhibits creative sterility in - stead of concealing it under the ""Hellenic"" hood. There can be little doubt that this anthology, published in Amer - ica as The Harvard Book of Contemporary A merican Poet - ry , is destined to go down in the history of manufactured ideas as the Edsel of our generation.

THEATRE Road Royal Court Jim Cartwright's scorching, bang-up-to-the-minute play is a State of the Nation piece with a vengeance. What form the vengeance will take is still unclear but if the author's super-real creation of life at society's scrap heap is to be trusted, then vengeance will come for sure. Road to Nowhere is implied in the title but on the route to that exit, drink, sex and slagging off can fill the nights. Guided by Ian Dury's
coarsely sardonic hnkman, we are taken into a score of rooms , picking up fragments of the life of those who inhabit this Northern dead-end road. For this production, the second revival in a year, half the stalls have been ripped out. Paul Brown's design incorporates a promenade built out from the stage to reach under the dress circle. The audience can walk any - where it likes; actors are likely at any moment to offer us chips, ask for a light or even dance at the disco. (I danced with Pauline.)
A tart pursuing her man will chase him all the way up to the upper circle. Iain Glen's skin - head , taut as a stretched bow, becomes a disciple of Buddah on the dress circle balcony. The openness and original - ity of Simon Curtis's produc - tion is a striking image for one
humanity can be assertive, extraordinary and just plain lively in any sort of place. This exhilarating play is also a lament for a vanished England. ""I can't get over the past, how it was,"" Alan David's ex-National Service - man recalls, quietly, with tears in his eyes at the recollection of days when everyone felt special but safe. Susan Brown's old dear, donning herself up in a scrap of mirror, remembers the war while retrieving milk from the cat's bowl for her cup of tea. The author gives these
strength, sometimes in one longish speech in a single appearance. He can also powerfully screw up the ten - sion , and contemporary drama has few incidents more resonant than the three scenes that follow the boy and girl who get into bed together and starve themselves to death. The world Jim Cartwright shows us is a raw one and his language, coupling obscenities and street poetry, gives a passionate, unavoidable truth about a dis-United Kingdom.

Bopha! Cottesloe If ever there was an example to prove Dario Fo's theory that art forms are born out of physical necessity it is the work of groups like the Ser - pent Players and the Earth Players, now operating in the church halls and classrooms of South African townships. Pieces like Asinamali and Percy Mtwa's Bopha! (both first seen at Edinburgh last year) give new definition to the term ""poverty theatre"" ; no longer an avant-garde elitist movement as it was in the
1960s, but an urgent popular style adopted by its prac - titioners because they have no choice in the matter. Like war poets with only old envelopes to write on, they compress huge passions into minimal resources, and pro - duce an impact that leaves you wondering why the theatre should ever need anything more than actors with well - trained bodies and something to say. Bopha! is an 80-minute fable about the role of blacks in the South African police. It tells the story of two brothers: Njandini, a servile cop with
immense pride in his petty official status; and Naledi, a reluctant recruit who joins the force as an alternative to destitution. The action turns on the ""suicide"" of a detainee, and the ensuing funeral which is bloodily broken up by the police — including Njandini who discovers that his own son is among the battered mourners, and resigns from a job he now recognizes as a betrayal of his people. If this were a naturalistic piece, you would be un -
comfortably aware that this change of heart is brought about by threats, which some - how manage to ignore the actualities of the burning tyre necklace and other reprisals which the township comrades inflict on traitors. In the author's production, and as played by the daz - zlingly accomplished trio of Sidney Khumalo, Aubrey Maolosi Molefe and Aubrey Radebe, it has the force of a biblical parable reinforced with magnificent dance and music, and the zest of village comedy.
| THEATRE Although there are no in - s t rumen t s , sets or lighting design, the effect is that of total theatre, as Mtwa is able to speak as expressively through vocal and bodily rhythms as through dialogue. The basic message, for in - stance , appears in the opening spectacle of an eloquently choreographed work song which then changes, as the cast goes into uniform, into jerkily ridiculous drill and shouts of ""to the left"" which disintegrate into ugly gibberish . Throughout the piece, se pa - rate episodes are punctuated with songs which translate personal into public drama: and which finally carry the story out onto the streets when the three actors become the crowd of mourners whose angry lamentations dissolve in cadencies of vocal machine - gun fire. Given that climax, and indeed the theme itself, the production is amazingly free from self-righteous indigna - tion .

Ted Hughes once confessed — in Poetry in the Making (1967), a collection of talks for children that includes some interestingly unguarded auto - biographical matter — that he began writing poems in adoles - ce n ce , when it dawned upon him that his earlier passion for hunting animals in his native Yorkshire ended either in the possession of a dead animal, or at best a trapped one. He wanted to capture not just live animals, but the aliveness of animals in their natural state: their wildness, their quiddity, the fox-ness of the fox and the crow-ness of the crow. The writing of poems became for
him the making of verbal cages which might achieve this - or, rather, as in the not dissimilar case of D.H. Lawrence, the poem it - self was intended to fit the quickness of the animal like another skin, a tegument of language. This activity has led some of his critics to see Hughes as a nature poet; though it seems to me that he is really always after bigger and more mysterious game than that label would suggest, and such a famous piece as ""The Thought-Fox "", for ex - ample , is as much about the act of writing a poem as it is about the animal that provides the poem with its inspiration.

No such awareness of com - plications need bother us in reading the Laureate's new book Flowers and Insects (Faber, £7.95). Here, bri ght - ened by handsome illustra - tions by Leonard Baskin, are 17 pretty straightforward rhapsodies in praise of bits and pieces of the natural world which have caught Mr Hughes's attention. I don't think anyone could find this less than charming, though those with a pre - Rite - of - Spring approach to country matters may consider there is altogether too much about thrusting, dugs, and pollen in such a poem as ""Sunstruck Foxglove"". A little of this goes a long way, and it might be possible to wish that Mr Hughes would write some
human erotica instead of for ever finding pornography among the plants: As you bend to touch The gypsy girl Who waits for you in the hedge Her loose dress falls open... All the same, I like the sly humour which surfaces here and there, most successfully in ""Daffodils "", where it seems that he attacks his own ten - dency to poeticize and sexual - ize the poor flowers., and even accuses himself of prostituting them. The results are too often banal for the book to be
considered a success, and much of the versification is slipshod or downright shoddy. I count all this a pity, since Ted Hughes has always struck me as a serious and authentic poet, restless in everything save his commitment to poet - ry , which is total and pro - found . No doubt he will survive even the strait-jacket of the Laureateship, though on the evidence of this little volume's retreat into noisy prettiness (all those exclama - tion marks! so much huffing and puffing and general flow - er - bullying to find what are meant to look like postures of joy!) it may be touch and go.

Daunting voice of Scots poetry
I am all for Giantism in Art"", wrote Hugh MacDiarmid, and it should not now be necessary to make the case for MacDiarmid's stature. Antho - ny Burgess has called him unequivocally the greatest poet in any branch of the English language this century. Yet one fears that it is still necessary, despite the publica - tion of The Complete Poems in 1978 and their appearance as a Penguin Modern Classic last year. It is not altogether surpris - in g . MacDiarmid is a daunt - ing poet . A good deal of his best work is in Scots , and what
is generally believed to be his masterpiece , A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle, is written in an ambitious Scots, not always immediately compre - hensible to Scotsmen, let alone Americans or the En - glish . Even in Scotland he may still be a poet more admired than read. His later work, in what he called Synthetic En - glish (by which he meant that he drew from any variety of the language that suited his immediate purpose ), is at once nervous , intellectual , clotted and verbose. He was a poet of ideas, and the Engjish have always shunned ideas in poetry . His weaknesses are more immediately apparent than his strengths. It is possible to read a good deal of
Hugh MacDiarmid: The Terrible Crystal by Alan Bold (Routledge & Kegan Paul, £4.95) MacDiarmid and conclude that he was a bad poet. He is often clumsy; his sense of rhythm can be defective; he can lapse into feeble line - fillers like ""I wis""; his borrow - ings were so extensive as to attract the charge of plagia - rism on more than one occa - sion ; his wide reading was often ill-digested ; and he sometimes seems to believe that the mere mention of a name is enough to prove his argument . Alan Bold admits all this in his book which is a model of expository criticism. He is no blind admirer of MacDiarmid. Admitting his weaknesses, he shows conclu - sively how little they matter. Almost any poet who writes on the grand scale, as MacDiarmid consistently did, will frequently fall flat on his face. MacDiarmid at his worst is as dull and pathetic as Wordsworth ; at his best he is as sublime.
Wordsworth is indeed a comparable poet . They share the same sense of a lost Eden, in MacDiarmid's case the Langholm of his childhood, but also the largely mythical Gaelic world he began to create for himself in the
Thirties . They share the same neo-Platonism - MacDiarmid's unending search for a lan - guage that could contain all language is a search for the Platonic ideal. As Wordsworth turned back to the language of common speech in reaction to the poeticism of the 18th century, so MacDiarmid, believing that most of the important words were killed in the First World War, turned back to Scots as ""a vast unutilized mass of lapsed observation, made by minds whose at ti - tudes to experience , and whose speculative and imagi - na tive tendencies were quite
different from any possible to Englishmen and Anglicized Scots today"". It is an inchoate Marcel Proust-a Dostoev - skian debris of ideas — an inexhaustible quarry of subtle and significant sound. It is one of the great merits of Mr Bold's book that he keeps before us MacDiarmid's neo-Platonism . Contradictory in so much, he was consistent
in this. Mr Bold makes clear also how important Nietzsche was to him. His Communism indeed was Nietzschean rather than truly Marxist; he saw it as the next phase of human evolution. It was his Nie tz - schean basis that enabled him to say without absurdity, ""I am Scotland today"", for hev had cast himself as an uber -

"Ackroyd, Peter","Apollo's Hansard, the politic art",The Times,1986-May-22,"London, England","Apollo's Hansard,the politic art
If politics is the art of the possible, then political verse is an almost impossible art: whoever heard of a lyric on the nature of compromise, or an elegy to pragmatism? But in fact there is a tradition of just such poetry (sometimes suitably disguised by allegory, or worse), and it is a merit of Tom Paujin's new an tholo - g y that it emphasizes the neglected aspects of poets who are generally regarded as ""immortal"" and there - fore above the routine business of life. Buf if man is a political animal, there is no reason why the songs of Apollo should not sometimes issue from the lips of partisans. And so, in his interesting introduc - t ion , Paulin rightly discounts the theory that ""art"" and ""politics"" are mutually exclusive occupations, and that a poem is a free floating agent which by some miracle has been cut
loose from social, historical , or biographical realities . This was a modern heresy inaugurated by T.S.Eliot, endorsed by LA. Richards, and subsequently institutionalized by a variety of mulish academic critics . But there are no electrified fences between the world and the poem: as Paulin says memorably here, "" ... politics is like a rain-storm that catches us all in its wet noise"". This of course poses peculiar problems for an anthologist since it means, or implies, that all kinds of poetry can be interpreted as express - ing political awareness — any poem without an overt ideological stance might be described as conservative , for example , and even the most hermetic lyricist, concerned with Love and Death , could be diagnosed as a purblind supporter of the status quo.
Gi ven this difficulty, a diffi - dent editor would proba - bly only have included those poems that are di - rectly and overtly engaged with political realities - certainly they comprise a long list , stretching from anonymous Thirteenth-Century lyr - ics through Dryden and on to Pound. Tom Paulin has adopted a broader attitude, however , which in practice has meant that he is happy to include poems that appeal to him for a variety of reasons; thus we have twelve pages of John Clare, whose ""To the Snipe"" could be described as
Peter Ackroyd reviews a book that shows how politics gets into everything, even the songs of the poets
THE FABER BOOK OF POLITICAL VERSE Edited by Tom Paulin Faber. £17.50 ""political"" only in the vaguest sense. Perhaps as a protest against blood - s p or t s ? But Paulin does have a theoretical perspective to lend a certain coher - ence to this heterogeneous selection , and in his introduction he distinguishes between a broadly ""conservative"" or ""monarchical"" tradition and a ""puritan"" or ""republican"" one — thus Dryden and Milton , Jonson and Blake, Eliot and Lawrence, can be seen as resisting
each other in endless battle rather than resting together in the quietus of a putative ""great tradition "". As a theory it has the merit of simplicity, but unfortunately it avoids what might be described as the problem of belief, aptly summarized in the expression that the truest poetry is the most feigning. The problem is best stated by the poets themselves. It was Thomas Chatterton who once said that he held in contempt any man who could not write on both sides of a controversy - a fluency emphasized by the American poet , Karl Shapiro, who maintained that he wrote as a Christian on one day and as a Jew on the next. It is in this context, of course, that ""politics"" is best seen as
an extension of aesthetics - since the overriding aim of the poet is to create significant form, he or she will entertain almost any belief in order to reach that happy state. Eliot was not really a ""monarchist "", despite the enormous cultural weight he is forced to carry in Paulin's in troduc - tion as an emblem of conservative pessimism. He was not really a monarchist because he was never really anything. In any case, if the history of modernism teaches us anything it is that the greatest ""conservatives"" are also the greatest poetic revolutionaries. What is the politics of that situation? But if Paulin's theory has the virtue of simplicity it also has the further merit, for an anthologist , of wide applicability . This book begins with Dante and ends with Miroslav Holub, including Ecclesiastes and ""Please to remember the Fifth of November"" en route . In fact the choice is eclectic to the point of oddness. There are 36 pages of Marvell , for example, and only two pages of Shelley; and, if there was room for 27 pages of Dryden's Absalom and Achitophel (readily available elsewhere), surely a small
space could have been found for Rochester s famous God bless our good and gracious King, Whose promise none relies on; It is easy to play the game of omissions, but it is a necessary task with an anthology that at least aspires to being authoritative. Why, for example, is Thomas Hood omi t - t ed ? His ""The Song of the Shirt"" was arguably the most important, and certainly the most popular, political verse of the last century; Elizabeth Barrett Browning's ""The Cry of the Children"" might share the palm with it but she, too, is not to be found here. Nor is Crabbe. But surely the most significant absence is- that of Ezra Pound? There is not one word by or about him here, although he is without doubt the most important political poet of the Twentieth Century. Some omissions are necessary and even instructive as an index of fashionable taste. It is easy to understand why Paulin has avoided all the ""beat"" and ""bomb culture "" poetry of the Sixties and early Seventies ; unfortunately, however, he has included some equally dubi - ous material of a later date; and one has only to look at recent Irish verse, over-generously represented here, to realize that the pressure of political events is no guarantee of poetic merit - or even of poetic interest. As a result this anthology, to paraphrase the words of a former ""monarchist"" Faber editor , begins with a bang and ends with a whimper - or, rather , a yawn. The notes are random and cryptic ; the textual apparatus (why have the spellings been variously modernized, half-modernized , or left intact ?) notable for its absence.

"Moorehead, Caroline",Enjoying a life of quiet interests,The Times,1986-Apr-26,"London, England","Enjoying a life of quiet interests
""Make them laugh, make them cry, bring on the dancing girls"" , Philip Larkin would say to his friend and biographer Andrew Motion, when they talked about writing, particu - larly poetry. When Larkin died, earlier this year, Motion did his best, in a long poem for the Times Literary Supple - ment , feeling there was per - haps something a little unseemly in writing so soon about a man he had greatly admired. But Motion wanted to cele - brate him at the moment when thoughts and memories were still so strong. He could hear the exact note of that ""Eeyore"" voice, saying over the telephone ""This is your subject speaking"". ""The first two, the laughing and the crying were ok"", Motion comments on his poem. ""I was a bit short on dancing girls."" They were easier to come by in The Lamberts: George, Constant & Kit, the biography he publish - es on Monday.
Andrew Motion became a friend of Larkin's when he was teaching at the University of Hull at the end of the seven - ties . They listened to jazz together and watched the box - ing on television and when Motion felt blue Larkin cheered him up, usually by ""being very much bluer
himself. Motion had come to Hull straight from the Newdigate Poetry Prize and a master's degree at Oxford on the poet Edward Thomas, which he was busy ""respraying and resoldering"" into a book. The idea of going North had seemed immensely attractive: it was so unlike the Oxfordshire landscape of his education — he was at Radley — and the Essex marshes that had been his home. His father was a brewer, from a long line of brewers and his childhood was horsy. Even so, the coun - tryside beyond Hull ""had something of the hauntingly
The Lamberts, George, Constant and Kit, form the subject of the first biography by Andrew Motion (right) poetry editor ofFaber&Faber . Interview by Caroline Moorehead
odd, deserted landscapes of my youth that I still walk about in in my mind's eye"" . For all that, for the walks and the times with Larkin, he had enough of Hull after three years, missing his friends and the things like opera and movies in London that he had never imagined he might miss. He left, against dire warnings from his friends, and spent his savings on a journey to India. He came back, broke, to find a letter on the mat, telling him that he had won the Observer Poetry Prize: £5,000 and the time to write a book on Larkin.
Still, there was no proper form to his life. He became two day a week editor of the Poetry Review, commuting from the house in Oxford he
had bought with money be - queathed by his mother, who died after ten years in hospital paralysed following a riding accident. On other days he traveljed the literary circuit, giving readings of his own poetry, growing increasingly uneasy that in so doing he was somehow becoming that dreaded self-conscious figure ""a poet, rather than just someone who sometimes writes poetry"". Then came a more marked act of fortune. Andrew Motion was visiting Chatto & Windus, trying and failing to interest them in the life of another poet, when Carmen Callil, the
managing director, asked him what he felt about the Lam - berts as a subject. He wasn't certain. He had never heard of George, the painter, and knew nothing of Kit beyond the fact that he was manager of The Who; Constant, the composer, was clearer: ""Something of a hero even, through Anthony Powell's Morland: I thought of him as an arbiter of fashion and man of sense."" He was soon hooked. Better still, Chatto suggested that he join the firm, for two days a week as Poetry Editor, while he made trips to Baltimore and Australia, in search of George's roots, and so he embarked on three and a half
years of the biographer's ferreting and dredging. They went well. Three gen - erations meant three spans of time, so research was not all contemporary, not all histori - cal ; there were archives as well as interviews. The Lamberts' interests were much his own: paintings through his mother, music through singing in the choir at school and pleasure in adult life. But Motion admits that while he likes Wagner, Con - stant preferred French and Russian composes; and rock and roll is just an adolescent memory. But he especially admired the way the Constants were never abso -
lutely first rate: ""In some ways, it's better to value them for not being achievers of the top rank: they illuminate pre - cisely by not being stars."" Andrew Motion's conversa - tion suggests that his life is now in good shape. He mar - ried a year ago, an editor at Chatto, so the firm has pro - vided him with a book, a wife and a job. He is still only in his early thirties. He has a house, a ""perfect Pooter house"" in Hackney. There are no plans for more biography, but Mo - tion is relieved to find the poetry was waiting for him when the Lamberts were done, ""growing up like weeds through stepping stones"" . He writes a poem a month, ""by
biological regularity"" and feels itchy if he doesn't, but he does so almost casually, not with anxiousness. It remains for him the most enjoyable of all art forms. Andrew Motion's small of - fice houses trophies from the Indian journey hanging on the walls. They include a row of cane carpet beaters, fashioned in twirls, which serve as ornament and screen. Motion wears carved silver bracelets. Against the wall, when I went to see him, lent a black cane; not, he said, either an Indian momento, nor a tribute to his fascination with the age of the Lamberts. He has had arthritis in his knees since the age of 17, which ""makes me very cross when it rains,"" and forces on him a ""slowed down life of constant reading"". More than most, his life has been circum - scribed by a small bank of interests .
Not long ago, a friend gave him an astrologer's birth chart she had drawn up of Jane Austen: it showed her life leading in one clear direction, towards solitude and writing. Andrew Motion sees his own in precisely the same pleasur - able mould, a contented focus: poetry, biography, publishing.

"Nye, Robert",Bright new panes broken,The Times,1986-Feb-13,"London, England","Bright new panes broken
Robert Penn Warren once likened the impact of the last poems of Sylvia Plath to ""a keen, cold gust of reality, as though somebody had knocked out a window pane on a brilliant night"" . A bright pane broken... Sylvia Plath thought in images. Poetry makes rooms for itself in the house of lan - guage . Rooms are necessary, and many poets can spend their lives in them contented - ly , looking out, glad of the walls and the company. But every now and again a poet comes along with an irritably developed sense of claustro - p hobia ; and then the furniture gets flung about and the window-pane broken; and ev - eryone else is suddenly de - lighted to be made aware of how stuffy and smelly the room had become, drawing in great breaths of cold, seeing the stars without interference. Sylvia Plath, whatever the merit of her achievement from poem to poem has done
it for many poets writing now. Carol Ann Duffy was born in Glasgow in 1955. She seems to have been educated in Roman Catholic convent schools (there are furiously anti-Christian , or more exact - ly anti-Papist , outbursts in her work) before taking a degree in philosophy at the University of Liverpool in 1977. Standing Female Nude (Anvil Press, £3.95) is her first book, a collection of 49 poems, in which the common factor is a skilful deployment of a kind of dramatic mono - logue informed by much quirky humour, and a good ear for the varieties of colloquial speech. At her best, though, she speaks in what I assume to be her own voice; and while that voice has learned something in the way of liberation from Plath's example, it achieves a clarity, a mixture of charm and truthfulness, which breaks the windows of perception in new ways altogether: / have turned the news

It happens that I recently had to edit an anthology of contemporary verse, and these lines of Duffy's, begin - ning a poem entitled ""Dear Norman"", were the first of hers that I ever read, leaping out by reason of their unmistakable poetic quality from a mass of otherwise dreary unsolicited manu - scripts . The second stanza of this poem, concerned at the

equal with dolphins. I shall name him Pablo, because I can. I wish I had room to quote the rest of the poem, if only to show how effortlessly Duffy maintains the meta - phor , while contriving to imply quite a lot about the nature of erotic fantasy and the power of the poetic imagination, rounding off the whole thing with a nice joke: Tomorrow I shall deal with the dustman. Let this one poem stand here as an introduction to a book that marks the debut of a genuine and original poet.

War , India , cricket ... and poetry. The subjects that preoccupy Alan Ross in this book of memoirs strike me as an odd mix. War, Indiaand poetry I could understand. Cricket, India and war - no problem. It's the cricket-attfif-poetry that sticks in my craw. But I freely admit that the only kind of cricket 1 know is compulsory cricket, and I despise everything to do with it. When Mr Ross tells us that his book is an attempt to show how ""a single-minded devotion to sport developed into a passion for poetry"" something in me resists. A single - minded devotion to sport doesn't develop into anything. It has nowhere . to go. It's like a single-minded devotion to collecting train numbers . It represents a stunting of the personality. And in fact Mr Ross does not, in this volume, write particularly evoca - tively about cricket. He writes for the enthusiast, allowing the recitation of names to do the work of description. Wisden-fanciers will know what he's on about. The rest of us won't. This drawback is not, incidentally, inevi - table . I've never been in the saddle and I have no interest in chasing foxes. But Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man has me enthralled. The story Mr Ross is telling - first there was cricket, then there was poetry and the war - is not dissimilar to Sassoon 's. And it is clear that Mr Ross feels a great sympathy for Sassoon. Like him, he is not at odds with the society in which he moves. He is, though, rather strikingly alone in it. Perhaps this is why, in his accounts of naval life, he often mentions that people are writing letters home. For him at this stage, there appears to have been no one to write to. He feels at one stage that, since he has no family ties, people think that if anyone should get hit it ought to be him. His love poems of this period were, he tells us, addressed to an imaginary woman. His actual sexual encounters appear to have been casual.
James Fenton reviews the memoirs of our man who caught the feel of war, cricket, and life BLINDFOLD GAMES By Alan Ross Collins Harvill. £12.95
Although there is much charm in his account of childhood in India, and although description of Haileybury and Oxford slips down easily enough , it is really the war and post-war sectiion of this book that commands all the interest and attention. Throughout the memoir, poems are interspersed with prose accounts of the experiences that gave rise to them. These poems were not all written in the heat of the moment. A notebook was begun, was lost, was recovered several years later. Poems were reconstructed or confected from different periods - the long poem about an arctic convoy, ""JW 51 B"", is peopled with characters from a different ship, because at the time of that convoy Ross scarcely knew anybody on board Onslow. Here is one of Mr Ross's shorter war poems , ""Captain 's Fur Collar :"" Stained and wet as shot rabbit And his eye clinging to a thread Like spit , a bullseye that might Be swallowed whole, taking sight with it. Hiding his forehead He picked his way from the bridge With the indifference of a waiter. We found him hours later, Bolt upright on the edge Of his bunk two decks below, Eye dangling like a monocle, face like.snow.
Horribly memorable on one reading, like JarreH's ""Bull-Turret Gunner"", it is perhaps the grotesqueness of the monocle image that stays with you. On subsequent examination however the horror deepens. To think of the injured eye as a bullseye, in the sense of a boiled sweet, is disgusting. To present the incident so laconically is hard on the reader . And properly so. And then there is that line With the indifference of a waiter, which springs something of a surprise and which seems to contain the meaning of the poem: this is what heroism is like, it is a kind of indifference. For the poets of the Second World War differ from those of the First in haying no particular axe to grind. It is not a question of saying: either you swallow the whole bogus death-or-glory business or you listen to the way it actually is. They say: you want to know how it is? Very well then, I'll tell you. The purpose of the war does not have to be trumpeted, nor is it questioned.
Here is Mr Ross in the role as genre painter , or war artist: The bulkhead sweating , and under naked bulbs Men writing letters, playing ludo. The light Cuts their arms off at the wrist, only the dice Lives. Hammocks swing, nuzzling in tight Like foals into flanks of mares. Bare shoulders Glisten with oil, tattoo-marks rip - p lin g their scales on Mermaids or girls' thighs as dice are shaken, cards played. We reach for sleep like gas, randy for oblivion. (From ""Messdeck "".) It is with the Second World War poets that one gets a strong sense of what life was like not at the moment of action but the rest of the time - off - duty , in the long boring interludes,
memoir, which proceeds with some lively characterization of the men the poet served with. Conditions in the defeated Reich were so extraordinary that they have produced many good accounts. Stephen Spender 's European Witness , for reportage ; Boll's early stories; not to mention The Third Man. Mr Ross had the writer's luck to have known a character as colourful as Mr Norris and as ruthless as Harry Lime, the murderer Chesney, real name Donald MerrelL In post-war Germany he was a successful racketeer , and the author 's bridge partner. When he planned his last murder he attempted to enlist Mr Ross as an alibi. The story is wonderfully told. Finally , I strongly recommend the poem ""Interrogation "", in which a captured Leutnant refuses to say where he has laid his mines. They break his nerve by placing the man in the bottom of the ship and steaming out to the mined area, so that if the ship hits a mine the Leutnant will be the first to go. A vivid anecdote, soon told , but like much in this book not to be forgotten.
away from the front. And this is all very much part of the story. Of course , for those on the arctic convoys there was no such thing as an interlude . The boredom, extreme discomfort, and intense danger came in the same triple-decker sandwich. The poem ""JW 51B"" is the most ambitious in the book, and while I do not think it the best handled it is unanswerably there as an achieve - men t . And it benefits , in this book, from keeping company with the prose",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/IF0500454318/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=b13828a1

Ice-cold, astringent talent
Someone once said that in the poems of Geoffrey Hill waTirmth is like a dying sun seen through a wall of ice. Now I think Hill would be not displeased by this criticism, so rong as it was conceded that the wall of ice is of his own making - in other words that it is itself the intricate, brilliant, yet transparent artifice which is the very fabric of his verse. He is a poet who erects verbal constructs between himself and experience, but within the various strict forms of those constructs he refines his thoughts and feelings so astringently that one would be hard put to find a slack line in his Collected Poems (Penguin, £3.95), an important volume which brings together for the first time his work over three decades.
Two sonnet sequences entitled ""Lachrimae"" and ""An Apology for the Revival of Christian Architecture in England"", dating from 1978, seem to me especially impressive and revealing in that thev deal with what I take to be a central

Hugo Williams's Writing Home (O.rford. £3.95) provides an illuminating contrast. Williams began. I believe, as a minimalist, but in this - his first full-length collection for ten years - he has left coyness and cleverness behind him, no longer demanding that the reader find significance in what he chooses to leave unsaid. In writing about his childhood and adolescence, and particularly in exploring his relationship with his actor father, he achieves a poetry of considerable elegiac tenderness informed and questioned by an intelligence that

The mood is again that which Hill attributes to Peguy, of one who is ""self-excommunicate but adoring"". Such a stance strikes me as wvorthy of respect, but it has also to be said that it fits rather too well with Hill's tendency to use his mastery of form as an excuse-for remaining tight-lipped.

glue factory which called itself the New Apocalypse. Since then Heath-Stubbs has found his own ways of making sense, settling for poems in a classical mnanner which was pastoral as he once described it in the angular and delightful Epitaph which he vrote for himself:
Mr Ieatk-Stubbs as you must uinderstand
Came of a gentlentan's famrly orut of Staffordshire
Of as good blood as any in Engtand
But he was wall-eyed and his logs too spare....
Even good pocts don't always hit their particular stride as regularly as that and the pieces in The Immolation of Aleph (Carcanet Prcss, £4.95) deploy more wit than deep feeling in their playing around with the theme of exile from Eden. All the same, we should value Heath-Stubbs for his devotion to poetry and for the high standards which he has always set himself in making it, things
Norman MacCaig is the man who put the ME in metaphysics. Self uinder self, a pile of selves I stand, he tells us in one of the first poems he has thought worth preserving in his Collected Poems (CIhatto & Windits/The Hogarth Press, £9.95), adding that when the process of his cerebration dissolves the landscape he so much enjoys, it is only to discover Farm within farm, and in the centre, me.
MvlacCaig's delight in the natural world is constantly inhibited by this solipsism. In the very early work - he has included nothing from his first tvo volumes - this restulted in a verbal surface as thick as glue and only slightly less gelatinous. Middle MacCaig, the poet of Riding Lights (1955) and The Sinai Sort (1957), expressed his intrusive sense of self more gracefully, using strict forms and a riddling logic to worry meanings out. This is the MacCaig most to my own taste, a fine if limited love poet of real persistance. Latterly lie has toned down the vit, loosened the metrical corset, and taken to writing rather leisurely and occasional poems about anything that amuses his sensibility. These verses have their admirers, being invariably wellturned, but the real MacCaig threatened briefly to be a twentieth-century Di!nne And we do his talents a disservice if we allow him tb forget it.
John Heath-Stubbs first appeared in print at about the same time as MacCaig, when 'they were fellows in the verbal

EDWARD THOMAS: A PORTRAIT
By R. George Thomas
Oxford. £12.95
_r many years before he
started writing poetry, Edward Thomas was a daun, tingly prolific Open Road prose writer, and he practised what he preached. So this is very much a book ofjourneys and arrivals. It is a life-and-work book, an Edward Thomas route book, taking in the long straight Roman roads of Britain, the higlhways and byways where he met his tramps and vagabonds, and finally the derelict side roads around Arras where Thomas was killed in 1917.
Thomas wrote so much himselfand a good deal has been written about him, some of it pretty dubious. It has been all too tempting to see him as a poet-hero of the First World War, finding his true metier in the exigencies of battle. One great value of this book. by a long-term Thomas expert, editor of the Collected Poens. is the cageyncss irtth which hc examines this
ssumption, arguing that Edward 'liomas would have been a poet alnywav. Another is its emphasis on Thomas's peculiar and tortuous emotional development. To call this book the passionate story of a marriage or even the story of a passionate marriage may give the wvrong impression of Emeritus Professor R. George Thomas's far from searing prose style. But it is still a story of enorrmous fascination, very moving in most basic human terms.
Edward Thomas was a schoolboy at St Paul's when he first arrived in the house on Wandsworth Common, a protege of James Ashcroft Noble, the critic and journalist, who encouraged his early ambitions to become a nature diarist and essayist, chronicler of life in woodlands wild. His courtship of Helen, James Noble's second daughter, began precociously and proceeded with precariously high ideals of honesty and honour.
This was no ordinary suburban romance. He bombarded her with questions about female physiologv, took to cold baths and dumb bells to tone up his own body. She used some of her earnings as a nursemaid to hire a bathing machinle and develop her swimming as a preparation for radiant motherhood. There was no question of consum-
mation, and when things got too much for them the-lovcrs would meet at the National Gallery where th-iy cxamined in minute detail the Greek male and female statues.
It was of course a strain and, not surprisingly perhaps, Edward Thomas very often becomes cross and melancholy. Even at this early stage. when he goes to Oxford, the pattern gets established for his frequent swings of mood. The inconsistency with which, for all his chaste ideals of marriage, he is easily enraptured by the sight of other women (and then of course feels bound to confess painfully to Helen). How he excels at rowing, but then starts to take laudanum. How he reads obscene books, and consequently worries at his frequent seminal emissions. It is by now quite clear he can behave with awful silliness. And only Helen's optimism and resilience, her -genius for joy"", comes anywhere near saving him. When, aftcr all, one Easter vacation a child is conceived en plein air on one of their energetic country rambles, he is still inclined to wonder idiotically if his blood is over-heated by licentious Oxford life.
T mhrough their erratic courtship
and their problematic marriage, Edward Thomas and Helen were inspired letterwriters. There is a current tendency among biographers to denigrate quotation, on the grounds that it holds up the narrative and bores the readers. But in this book quotation is in fact the main excitement: it is the way of watching the relationship develop and, through an astute interweaving of brief passages from Edward Thomas's notebooks *and
books published, the means of relating life and love to work in progress. Indirectly perhaps it tempts one to regret the demise of Iettcr-writing in modem married life.
Edward Thomas's twin passions were the idea of nature and the idea of nationality. His dream existence was wild rural life in Wales. However, he and Helen spent their entire married life in the suburbs of London or, at best, in the Home Counties since Thomas in fact needed to be in reach of Fleet Street and the newspapers and literaryand-general magazines on whose behalf he noted nature and reviewed with speed and frenzy. In 1908 he was producing 20 reviews per month. For all his hero-worship of the image of Welsh scholar / preacher / bards composing in some mountain fastness, he did much of his best writing at Petersfield in Hampshire in a cosy little gardenhouse study called the Bee-house, verv close to Bedales School, whose style and inmates he detested, and whose brand of social conscience increased his self-disgust.
He often wandered off. This was a part of his own nature: he liked to see himself as the by-passer, the vagrant, the plain-spoken rural traveller, the man he once described as ""as independent as a parrot or a tramp"". It was also very much the fashion of the time, the habit of the coteries where Edward Thomas mingled, which this book describes so well. Though he did have other loves, a sudden strange obsession with Helen's one-time charge, Hope Webb, the child of nature, the main challenge to domestic life was his
grcat craving for male conviviality, his long walks with the selected (male) companion, his liking for a well-packed knapsack probably containing his own Pocket Book oj Poents anid Songsfor Open Air.
""He laughed heartily in circles given more to laughter than to preciousness"", as his old friend Harry Hooton approvingly explained his longing for good fellowship. Away from home he joined the literary extroverts: walked hard with Hilaire Belloc, smoked his pipe with Arthur Ransome, parked around and camped in the New Forest with the Farjeons, played cricket with Clifford Bax (when, not being good at cricket, he tended to be banished to the outficld).
any of his ideas about M / poetry. developed from
long tramps in the English-Welsh Border country with Robert Frost, the poet of New England on the make in England proper: the Border country did not seem so far offfrom Vermont.
But indefatigable roamer as he was, Thomas's homing instinct was in a way still stronger, and he always did go back to Helen, who endeavoured to calm him down with cod liver oil and Plasmon Cocoa. Helen in her frumpy frocks, liair plaited round her head, generous, emotional, always at the mercyi of her menstrual cycle: a poignant reminder of that golden age of womanhood when marrying a genius seemed more or less enough.
This is an old-fashioned book in a good sense, gaining more from acumen than it loses from prolixity. It is at its best, and tersest, in the Thomas-at-war chapters. The letters from France arc, like the entries in the diaries, clear and laconic, detailed, realistic. Edward writes almost happily to Helen from the trenches:

POETRY OF THE CAROLINGIAN RENAISSANCE By Peter Godman Duckivorth. ï¿½29 50
Charlemagne, that - Frankish scourge of the Saxon, master of most of Europe, and (siipe .800). Holy Roman Emperor, finally. checked his bags with Charon in 814. Semi-literate though he was, he had been the force behind an almost unparalleled revival of learning in Europe.
The problem Godman faces :is that Carolingian Latin is extensive and heterogeneous, much of it is very difficult (odd Latin, allusive contexts), and as poetry much of it scarcely crawls out of the McGonagall class. Godman's solution is clean and simple. An eightypage essay introduces the sixtyone extracts, locates them and their authors in their literary and cultural context, and offers many new solutions to problems of ir-orprefation. The Latin extracts follow in two
chronological sections (Charlemagne, 768-814, and the rest. 814-c. 890). Each has a facingpage translation.
The result is extremely ,impressive. Under Godman's scholarly and sympathetic guidance we bid farewell with Altuin to his study (=life) in Aachen:

we celebrate Charlemagne with countless court hangers-on, who fawn on their superior with a servility surpassing even that of a Cabinet Minister desperate for advancement, (but we also, with Walahfrid Strabo, visit Charlemagne in hell). Spring contests with Winter, drunken judges are reprimanded,, schoolboys encouraged (nain sine doctrina rita peril hzominum), Lindisfame's destruction lamented, St Brigid's washing hung on a sunbeam, and the triumph of Christianity proclairmed.
If, at the end of the book, even Godman's advocacy has failed to alter my feeling that much Carolingian poetry is handle-turning stuff, that does not diminish my admiration for this fascinating book.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS151752939/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=5b892c83

The verse screws its courage to the sticking place, and sweats and grunts manfully.

So how good was Robert Lowell, after all? These three books, revisited, seem to have shrunk in stature. They show a man of much talent playing a part, fulfilling a mode, belonging to the politics of literature rather too much to belong to poetry. Whether the man was ever really the major poet he aspired to be I beg leave to doubt. Perhaps every age gets the Lowell it deserves? Robert was better than his cigar-smoking cousin Amy, empress of imagism.
It must be about a quarter of a century, too, since the very different voice of Peter Redgrove begn. 'to be heard on the -scene. Tihe Man, Named East (Roadedt & Kegan Paal, £4.95) is-- hiis ninth collection, and it is full of ~the kind of extraordinary things we have come to expect"" from him. Redgrove, self-described as a ""Scientist of the Strange"", lives in Cornwall; in a'small seaside town, and many of the poems in this book draw their imagery from wind and water, coastal strip and, Cornish rock, the elemental battle he sees around him. All the same, he is nothing so simple-as a Nature poet, this occult metaphysician' intensely committed to his own way of thinking -about the World in images - or, more truly, apprehending and recreating the process of the world in images. I've never been a wholehearted fan of Redgrove when he goes magicking, but when he leaves out the blood and shit and jewels and concentrates on saying something difficult in the simplest way he can then he writes superbly:

First published in 1959 and now made available again in paperback, Robert Lowell's Life Studies (Faber, £C2.95) has proved to be one of the most durable and influential books of verse of the last quarter century. Its autobiographical content and confessional style as of a man talking on a psychiatrist's couch, have been much imitated. Lowell himself encouraged the view that the freer verse he achieved in these pieces should be preferred to the formal rhyming decasyllabics of his early work, and Sylvia Plath and others found inspiration and encouragement in his admissions of mental illness, and so on. It is possible to take another view, though, and find these poems thin, chatty, and over-relaxed. Even more to the point, one may notice that insuch an admired poem as ""Skunk Hour"" Lowell merely substitutes one sort of rhetoric for another. His early poems were packed with thunder and enjambment, they postured and strutted. This postures too, only instead of strutting it cowers: One dark night,
my Tudor Ford climbed the
hill's skull,
I watched for love-cars. Lights
turned down,
they lay together, huUl to hull,
where the graveyard shelves on
the town ....
My mind's not right.
The literary nature of ""Skunk Hour"" has been insufficiently stressed. One dark night calls up St John of the Cross, ten lines later I myself am hell brings in Milton and Marlowe. The image of the skunks in the final stanza is certainly arresting, but the structure of the poem as a whole is too flimsy to carry its ainbitionw Those who thrill to such a declaration as My mind's not right because it sounds ""honest"" or ""direct"" might be in the grip of a peculiarly modern confusion of sincerity with crudity. Above all, it seems worth insisting that in Life Studies Lowell did not suddenly cease to be a rhetorician. What the book sees him doing is changing the tone of his rhetoric.
Subsequent volumes from this poet appear to me to have confirmed this, especially another two now also made available in paperback - For the Union Dead (Faber, £2.95) and Near the Ocean (Faber, £2.95).

Gavin Ewart would no doubt hate to be told that vision and inspiration were still alive and well and living in Cornwall. His The Young Pobble's Guide to His Toes (Hutchinson, £5.95) continues the pursuit of all things bright and frivolous whicb Ewart has made his own in the last ten years. Yet under this poet's delightful gift for light verse there is a very mordant mind at work, concentrated wonderfully on the eternal verities of age and sex, of birth and copulation and death. The title poem, a spirited rejoinder to Edward Lear, is very much a key one here. In Lear, it will be remembered, when the Pobble loses his toes, his Aunt Jobiska tries to reconcile him to their loss: It's a fact the whole world knows,IThat Pobbles are happier without their toes. Ewart will have none of this:
The moral shines bright as a mermaid's hair.

Slow/4v grewv out of his long hexamneters ...
All ,for the Wolves is a delightful book, a real eye-opener, testamentary to a lifetime's devotion to the craft of verse, something of a primer of poetic possibilities which, with luck, .will prove inspiring to a younger generation.
When young, I believe, Peter Russell sat at the feet of Ezra Pound whose own The Translations of Ezra Pound, with an introduction by Hugh Kehner (Faber, £f395 paperback), is perhaps this century's classic primer of poetic technique as well as being the distillate of a lifetime's reading in various languages. From the earlv
""A little vice never did very much harm,
But Virtue has ruined many an innocent fellow.....""
Peter Russell, the poet who wrote these lines, first passed them off years ago as a ""translation"" from the work of an obscure ancient Roman, one Quintilius, of whom it was reported that he had died of a surfeit of lentils, and that when the only copy of his second book of Odes went down in a shipwreck Savonarola said, ""The Church can afford the loss"".
I want to draw attention to Russell's creation and realization of Quintilius because I think that what we have here is a splendid contemporarv development of the Browning/Pound procedure of finding a mask or persona which enables the writer to discover his own voice: bv pretending to be someone else. These Quintilius poems are an extraordinary achievement - wise, racy, very shrewd, and very funny; the aphoristic outpourings of a pissed-off lyricist who has turned his back
on the barbarians and taken to cultivating asphodel and hemlock in his own garden. And this, of course, is identical with the position adopted by Russell throughout the volume of his selected poems All for the Wolves, edited by Peter Jay (Annvil Press, £7.95 or f4.95 pape,).
An English poet of the high Romantic tradition, now in his mid-sixties, he has lived abroad, mostly in Italy, for the past 20 years. going his own way, indifferent to fashion, content to issue his work in semi-private editions or to see it circulate in manuscript amongst his peers. There is much to be said in favour of this as a strategy for any serious poet in a century where the decades seem to have grown progressively even lower and more dishonest than Auden noted the Thirties to have been. Not that Russell subscribes to any naive nonsense of the poet having his place ""outside"" society; one of his best poems turns on an almost mystical vision of that relationship:
versions of Cavalcanti to the two Odes of Horace done into English in.. 1964, what we have here. is a collection of exquisitely made and always enjoyable verse, only infrequently opaque in the way Pound could be in his original work. Look especially at the famous 'Cathy"" sequence, and the brilliant rendering of ""The Seafarer"". Scholars have pecked at the latter, but no one else has ever caught the sword-againstshield sound of Anglo-Saxon verse so exactlv.
William Empson, who died last year, published no new verse of any consequence after 1940. His reputation rests upon work done in the 13 years before that date - almost half of it belonging to the three academic years. from 1926 to 1929, when he was reading English at Cambridge. If the *term were not so distasteful, one might say that this Collected Poems (Hogaiih Press, £14.50 paper) shows Empson to be. the undergraduate poet par excellence - his work reeks with wit, is itchy with self, shows off
in the way that onlv very young and very intelligent poets can show off.
If that was the whole story then Empson would not be worth remembering, but of course it is not. His most memorable poems (and this will be curious only to the young) have a quality of mystery and incantation which runs quite counter to his professed rationalism:
Not but they die. the teasers and the dreams.

- That seems 10 me to have the sort of absolute authority you find in a handful of passages in Pound's ""Pisan Cantos"", and in some T.S. Eliot and Laura Riding and C. H. Sisson. but not much elsewhere in twentiethcentury verse in English. However, it would not altogether surprise me if Peter Russell still had some scraps of Quintilius to ""translate"", and these turned out to be somewhere in the same league.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS151752796/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=6363805f

These are the opening lines, and it has to be said, I think, that for all their glamour they lack the force to be found in the finest work in this poet's first book Death of a Naturalist (1966), where celebration of the experiences of his childhood gave him good clear subjects in which to disolve his natural verbal sweetness. - -
There is something intellectually and emotionally blurred about Heaney just now; an unpleasant excess of charm, a luxury of spiritual self-torment which comes out as linguistic self-caressing. His version of the old Irish work Sweeney Astray (Faber, £2.95 paperback) is no better, indeed it spreads words over the story of Mad Sweeney as if they were butter. This is Kerrygold verse, Irish Parnassian with one eye on the anthologies. I trust that Heaney - an authentic poet who elsewhere reveres what I take to be the integrity of Thomas Hardy for ""the stir A fiddle could make in his reluctant heart"" - gets back in touch with the language of his own inspiration, some music beyond
In a fine critical distinction in one of his letters, Gerard Manley Hopkins divides the language of verse into two kinds. The first is poetry proper, the language of inspiration - what he referred to elsewhere as ""The roll, the rise, the carol, The creation."" The second kind he calls Parnassian.
Parnassian, Hopkins says, can be spoken only by real poets, but it is not in the highest sense poetry, being ""spoken on and from the level of a poet's mind, not, as in the other case, when the inspiration, which is the gift of genius, raises him above himself."" Parnassian, in other words, is what a poet writes when he tries to write a poem. The inspired poem comes at its own will, though of course only to those with the craft to catch it.
Now it seems to me that much of the work in Seamus Heaney's Station Island (Faber, £2.9S paperbackc) - the sixth c ollection of verse by a writer often hailed as the best Irish poet since Yeats - is a good but sad example of what Hopkins meant by Parnassian. The title poem, in particular, an autobiographical quest piece set on an island which has been a place of pilgrimage in Ireland for
the sound of his own voice, before his next volume.
Neither humming nor singing but something uncommonly like good talk distinguishes the bulk of the work in Geoffrey Grigson's Montaigne's Tower and other poems (Secker & Warburg, £5.95). Grigson, now in his eightieth year, comes on as quirkily and harshly as ever, a sort of Landor of the late twentieth century, combative yet lyrical, committed always (to borrow a vword invented by James Joyce) to a kind of Jocoseriousness which suits his own particular poetic stance like second nature:
White clouds move into blue
Over our cliff, light sparkles on trees
below
Only now and again, though, wve are
out ofthe wood, And kissing a photograph is a cold Business, and does little good.
That is fairly characteristic of Grigson in that its unremarkable beginning quickly turns *upon itself to say something memorable, and the more striking for being understated.
The poems in Dick Davis's The Covenant (Anvil Press, £3.95) are admirably plain additions to a slim body of work which has already established this poet as the most talented living disciple of the American poet and critic Yvor Winters, from whom Davis learned a style in which thought and feeling and form blend with classical precision. At the other end of the scale Venus and the Rain (Oxford, £4.50 paperback-) shows a gifted young Ulster poet, Medbh McGuckian, spinning sumptuous Parnassian stuff out of all sorts of confused erotic and domestic perceptions.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS185700408/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=8a235720

Fifty years ago to anyone interested in literature the name Robert Bridges meant a lot.
This is so no longer. Bridges is' now so neglected that the Oxford University Press has let his works go out of print. It should know better. Bridges is one of the finest' English poets of the last hundred years;'his only contemporary rivals""Hardy, Yeats, and Hopkins; and, at his best, equal to any of them.
His genius shows itself primarily in his inastery of his instrument. ""WhatK led me to
poetry,"" he says somewhere,'' ""was the inexhaustible satisfac tion of forii . I did ' not suppose that the poet's emotion was in any way better: than another's."" As'a matter of fact his emotions were not the same as those of other persons. his choice, of 'subject. matter di'scloses a strong 'individual :diosyncrasy. This appears in
retlection idoes one realise that they are words no one else would have chosen.
Pleasure in his poetry leads naturally to. an interest, in the man who wrote it. Up till now we have not been able to learn much about Bridges: he did not approve of such questions and took pains to see they got no answers. This was because he thought the questioner had no right to ask them not because he had anything to hide. To know what he was like therefore we must turn to those who remember him. Those accounts depict him as an impressive personality, and of an unexpected kind. The author of these reticent, subtle poems was a grand bearded figure, magnificently handsome in a rugged style.
His letters, in two stout volumes, might be expected to help us to know the man more intimately. But most of the letters are no more than brief communications about practi-
al and impersonal matters, unilluminated by confidences, let alone by confessions. The result is that, though these volumes, adriiirably edited by Professor Stanford, will be essential reading for any future scholar studying. Bridges, the general reader must still be content to look for the man in his poems. But perhaps this is the wisest course. to take with any poet whose works are worth reading.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS185176113/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=11ea1ee1

* A living English poet with at least some of Crane's vigour is Tony Harrison, as can be seen from his Selected Poems, published simultaneously in King Penguin paperback (£3.50) and Viking hardcover (£9.95). Harrison was born in Yorkshire in 1937, and has been hailed as the first genuine working-class poet England has produced this century. At his best, his work is all his own, witty, uninhibited, a series of plain but exuberant statements about birth and copulation and death, all discovered with a mixture of glee and deadpan truthfulness. He defines his own gift agreeably:
flow you became a poet's
a mystery! W Wherever did you get your talent
from? I say: I had two uncles, Joe and
Harry - One was a stammerer, the other
dumnb.
I like the way Harrison makes his poetry out of whatever he finds around him, formulating his ideas from what are obviously lived experiences. Honesty is not such a common virtue in contemporary verse that one can afford to ignore it, expecially when it comes in well-shaped stanzas.
* Those who care to collect all this poet's separate editions will also want his translation of work by a fourth century Alexandrian epigrammatist, Palladas: Poems (Anvil Press, £2.95 paperback). Palladas, pagan and argumentative, has a snarling wit that speaks across the centuries in a -voice not unlike Harrison's anyway.
* Marianne Moore's Complete Poems (Faber, £2.95 paperback) consists of verses tailored to suit their author's studied eccentricity - finicky-worded stanzas of varying line-lengths, their syllables religiously counted, their rhyme-patterns arbitrary, the whole a sort of dry but affectionate verbal interlacing of all that has taken her fancy, from a giraffe down to Yul Brynner. I can enjoy. the cleverness, but I recognize poetry only on those few occasions where Moore is shaken out of absorption in the quaintness of her own fancy sufficiently to write without it. One such occasion, entitled ""I May, I Might, I Must"", is short enough to be quoted in full:
If you will tell me why thefen appears impassable, I then
will tell you why I think that I can get across it ifI try.
Emily Dickinson could have written that. Too many of the longer poems are more like things Emily Dickinson could have sewn.
Robert Lowell once called Hart Crane ""the Shelley of my age"", which gets it about right. The surprise is that the work of this modem Shelley has been unavailable in Britain for years - a state of affairs now rectified by the publication in paperback of The Complete Poems of Hart Crane, cdited by Brom Weber (Bloodaxe Books, £4.95). Here is all the verse which Crane wrote in the course of his short and tortured life, a hundred poems or so, many of them gauche or fragmentary, strident or incoherent, but perhaps half a dozen of them not, half a dozen of them near-perfect expressions of an absolutely twentieth century lyrical genius:
O brilliant kids, frisk with your
dog,
Fondle your shells and sticks,
bleached
By time and the elements; but
there is a line
You must not cross nor ever
trust beyond it
Spry cordage of your bodies to
caresses
7Too lichen-faithful from too
wide a breast. The bottom of the sea is cruel.
Crane, of course, is one of those writers who arouse violent sympathies in their admirers and equally passionate dislike in other people. He could be fastidious and precise in his use of language - see the superb early po,m, ""Chaplinesque"", which among other felicities manages to catch the movement of Chaplin's little tramp persona in its rhythm and choice of words. He could also pour out great clouds of windy rhetoric, sentimental when it wasn't simply evasive or pretentious - see the ""Indiana"" and ""Cape Hatteras"" sections of ""The Bridge"". To my own mind ""The Bridge"" - that vastly ambitious attempt to write a consciously major poem that would make ""a mystical synthesis of America"" - seems irrelevant to Crane's real achievement as a poet.
That achievement I would define by reference to the half dozen poems already mentioned, which comprise the Chaplin one, ""The Wine Menagerie"", ""The Broken Tower"", ""Legend"", ""Praise for an Urn"", and the important sequence called ""Voyages"", quoted above. In these poems Crane's peculiar kind of lyricism,. leaping language, passionately intelligent feeling, is held in balance, however precariously, by a desire to make sense of something beyond himself. I do not think one does Crane any disservice by insisting on his best work, and pointing out its difference, almost in kind, from what in drunken moments he thought was most representative ofhim.
He had supreme lyric gifts, and he, wrote with more dense and complex feeling than most of his contemporaries. It is a tragedy not only that he killed himself, but * that he was critically misled or self-deluded about the nature of his own talent. The mystery is not that he lived and died in the Dionysian way that he did, but that he managed to stand still in himself some half a dozen times",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS184782726/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=38d6d1c5

flirts with nonsense. delighting all fans of the difficult and the obscure, eschewing any kind of clear expression of thought or feeling.
There are times when this leaves the reader frustrated. as though the poets, sole object was the deliberate avoidance of meaning. But then meaningless. ness is not so hard to achieve, and Ashbery - even at his most coy and opaque - succeeds in writing lines of uncommon memorability. It is as if he says: ""What this means is that I make you remember ii."" And in his new volume A Wave (Carcanet Press. f4.95 paperback). such sayings work often enough to be impressive:

The step into disorder is. I think. Ashbery's own, and he does mean it. every strange word of it. and his injunction thal we should ""just keep playing"" is as serious as Auden's.
No Martian. this guy, but a neighbourly intelligence at work on common human experience. whose jokes and inventions are informed by an all too familiar despair. I recommend Ashbery's teasing yet 'often very beautiful and funny poetry to readers who have not yet made its acquaintance. The nearest thing I know to it in Eng!ish - to try to define its peculiar flavour - is the prose of Ronald Firbank. Like Firbank. too, he is irresistibly readable in large doses. There are not many new books of verse which one wants to read right through, from cover to cover, as soon as they comiie from the press, but any new Ashbery always has thai effect on me.

Anthony Howell. and his volume Notions of a Mirror (Anvil Press, f350).deserves.the attention of anyone who cares for poetry at all. In fact, I do Howell an irjustice by speaking of him as anyone's follower, since ever since his remarkable first book Inside the Castle (1969) he has been quite capable of standing and running on his own poetic feet. But his early work was that of a young man of great natural lalent unable or unwilling to much refine or even define a capacity for sensual confusion which was shamelessly employed to keep a poem going when inspiration failed. And he has learned from Ashbery's example how to look at genuinely intense feelings through a splendidly literate quizzing-glass of wit:

Howell tends at tim1les to produce poems where an overdecorative usage of adjectives blurs definition. in that the poet pursues the pattern suggested by the decoration rather than the object he set out to describe or define. But his faults are those of a real poet, a fellow with too much feeling, and a working mixture of delight and despair at his ovn capacity to find forms for its expression.

It is the -nature ofman that puzzles me, As I walkfrom Saint James's Square,to
Charing Cross; The polite mechanicals are boing home, I understand their condition and their
loss. He belongs among those poets who have used the twists and
turns of common speech to say things not commonly said.
There is an authority to these words in this order. They fix themselves in the head and change the way we read the
world and other poets. Perhaps it is worth adding that when I first encountered his work,
more than twenty years ago, it
had no immediate emotional or intellectual appeal, and indeed I thought that I disliked it. Then one day I was compelled to the realization that I had whole
tracts of this dislikeable stuff by heart. This is another trait of
major poetry, I suspect: it works on and in the reader, even when he or she does not identify with
C. H. Sisson once described himself as ""primarily a civil
servant - like Chaucer."" The irony of the definition is
characteristic. Its confidence may be justified by his
Collected Poems (Carcanet Press, fl4.9S), published to mark his 70th birthday. The most throwaway of Sisson's remarks, like the most
scemingly casual of his verses, turn out to have barbed edges.
It is true, on a lcvel of fact, that he joined the Ministry of Labour in 1936, and rose through various ranks to
become a senior and well-
respected civil servant, ending
up as Assistant Under Secretary of State in the Department of Employment and Productivity before his retirement in 1973.
But it would also be true to say - so long as no doubt is cast upon the seriousness of his
concern for truth in all places
not excluding those from which we are governed - that his Civil Service career was just a means of passing the time between
poems. In terms of merit Sisson is primarily a poet, like Chaucer.
A commonplace is goodfor nothing now, Yet that is how the world goes, all the
same. Nothing is what you had when you se
out. And nothing you will have when you go
home.
That seems to me a perfect
understatement of something understood, an excellently
simple way of saying a hard thing. The lines have an
overflow of moral authority, of verbal and more-than-verbal
rightness - and perhaps it is that quality which distinguishes the great poet from the good minor ones? A reviewer is likely to be wrong about such matters, but to my mind and ear Sisson has most of the marks of a major
talent. There is difficulty to be overcome in reading his work,
but it is the difficulty thrown up by an authentic originality of rhythm, which is to say that
Sisson does not have anyone else's voice, nor is he a man versifying whatever takes his
fancy but one impelled to find a personal rhythm for some
more-than-personal truth which it has been given him to utter.
what it seems to be saying. Samuel Beckett's Collected
Poems 1930-1978 (John Calder, £8.95) is the work of another
unmistakably major writer who was never.quite born as a poet
until he found himself in prose. Such a piece as -Whoroscope"" (winner of the Nancy Cunard £10 Competition for the best
poem on the subject of Time in the summer of 1930!) is now
unreadable except as a joke. But it is a brilliant and spiky and
serious joke, full of the touches later developed into a whole game of verbal tennis in the novels. Apart from such
foreshadowings, Beckett's finest verses are in French, among them the outstanding:
Je voudrais que mon amour meure qu'il pleuvesur le cimetiere et les ruelles otje vais
pleurani celle qui crut m 'aimer. Four lines as bitter and
beautiful as anything he has written.
The other plain indication of genius in this book is the
translation of Apollinaire's
""Zone"", which first appeared in the magazine transition many years ago, and which
interestingly anticipates the
sparse yet lyrical techniques and procedures of Beckett's later
fictions. The result is sometimes pure Apollinaire (The most
modern European is you Pope Pius X), sometimes pure
Beckett (The love I endure is like a syphilis), always pure delight. This confirms my
suspicion that the twentieth century did not begin until
round about 1913 and then only in Paris.
Sebastian Barker's A Nuclear Epiphany (Friday Night Fish Publications, 22a Lawford
Road, London NW5 2LN, £2
paperback) is another rhapsodic outpouring by an
extraordinarily gifted young
man who seems utterly at the mercy of his own talents. Mr
Barker is a sort of latterday Kit
Smart, singing and shouting but above all praying at the top of
his voice. As Dr Johnson said of Smart, I'd as soon pray with him as with anyone else. In
other words, I think this chap is the real thing, some kind of visionary - Poetry is the

lain Crichton Smith has always been a difficult poet to pin down with critical phrases. A habit of elusiveness seems second nature to him, along with a willingness to publish unlicked work, to allow some of his failures to be seen, to take risks and make mistakes as part and parcel of his deep dedication to poetry as a kind of abandoning of himself to the dictates of the poem. ""I have always believed,"" he said once. 'in a poetry which contains fighting tensions and not in a poetry of statement."" This does not mean that his verse is confused or inchoate. Open any of his many books and it is the same voice that you will hear - quiet, excited, a bit awkward, cryptic sometimes, admirably simple in the saying of hard things at others, at all points
devoted to the rendering of immediate experience in terms of metaphor.
Who dailv at the ricketv table
itrites andsings. writes andsings, Venus with the one arm. Apolto with ihe one leg,
The stuttering rainbow that hirples like early crayons into the sea.
A self-satire? No doubt. Mr Smith does indeed give the impression of working at a rickety table, and also of thinking at the nib of his pen, of working on the page, of saying the first things that come into his head from one line to the next. The excellence lies in how oflen that next line seems inevitable. He may indeed ""hirple"" (Scottish dialect word meaning to limp or hobble), but the best pieces in his new collection The Exiles (Carcanet Press. £4.95 paper) are rather more than the blurred effusions of a ""stuttering rainbow"". In short, he. strikes me as an indubitably inspired poet, taking on the world in poem
after poenm. The interesting thing about Smith, even then, is that in the thick of the war of images which spring from his ""fighting tensions"" you suddenly find him making straightforward statements of the most peaceful simplicity:
Not through snow the ancient

not Hamlet or Othello or Ulisses. it is in heat that tragedvi is

James Fenton's is a less restless and unpredictable talent, but not to be despised for that. There are only eight poems making up his Children in Exile (Salamtander Press Edinburgh,

Anvil Press Poetry Ltd and Carcanet New Press Ltd, to give each young but august imprint its proper name, are two clients of the Arts Council not entirely dissatisfied with the meting and doling that has recently taken place from 105 Piccadilly. Anvil was founded in 1968 by Peter Jay, Carcanet a year later by Michael Schmidt. Both publish a great deal of poetry. Both are what, historically, arc known as little presses. Both reflect their founders' taste and judgment, their commitment to and pleasure in poetry.
Their authors include, for at least one book each: (Anvil) Harry Guest, Peter Russell, Gael Turnbull, Michael Hamburger, Stephen Spender, Sylvia Plath, Joseph Brodsky, Peter Porter, Derek Mahon, Charles Tomlinson; (Carcanet) Christopher Middleton, John HeathStubbs, Michael Hamburger, HD, C. H. Sisson, Edwin Morgan. Elizabeth Jennings, Donald Davie. Larger and older imprints - Secker and Warburg, Faber and Faber, OUP. Chatto & Windus, and Penguin - may publish better-known, more ""popular"" poets. but as they also publish authors of ficion and non-fiction known sometimes to achieve best-sellerdom they are not, except perhaps by their principals, taken to be as committed or serious poetry publishers.
Whereas most publishers would as willingly yield up their costings as they would confess to a pact with the Devil. Mr Jav and Mr Schmidt agreed to allow me, and thus you, to be partv to their figures. Thus we can see thow poetrv publishing farcs in the mid-1980s.
Mr Jay reports that a tvpical 64-page slim volume - as a collection of new poems is known - costs about £1.000 to produce in an edition of 750 copies, the quantity he usually prints. with a paperback cover. This gives a unit price of £1.33 per copy exclusive of overhcads.
A five-times mark-up, which is probably lower than par for the publishing course, would suggest a retail price of £6.50 or slightly more, which hardiv anyone would pay, ""a price"", says Mr Jay. ""of about £4 would be normal and reasonable"". He tends to pay a non-returnable advancc of £150 to his poets against a IO per cent royalty.
Carcanct pays a 10 per cent royaltv, too. but of'ers a variable advance. Mr Schimlidt publishes mansv more tities Ihanl Anvil, about 50 per annum. He gencrally prints 500-750 of new poets. 750 of' major hardback collections. 1.000-1.500 of paperbacks by ""known poets"".
Of a well-known poet's collectced poems he did a first printing of 750 and a reprint of the same number: ""plus a swingeing price rise since wve lost monev on the first edition"". Small presses tend to equate editions with impressions. whicih is understandable but bibliographically wvrong.
Michael Schmidt's press has just published the collected poems of a highly respected living poet. The book makes 384 pages and a mere 782 copies have been printed. The retail price is £12.95, a giveaway considering the prices of most novels. The gross value (eg number of copies printed times retail price) is £10,126.90. The break-even point is a sale of 557 copies. The cover design cost is £50. the typesetting a mere 700, approximately £1.80 per page.
These figures incorporate no overhead allocation, and Carcanet has a staff of three full-time and three part-time employees. Rent and rates have to be paid, too. Anvil's figures are similar. They requested a grant of just under £50.000 from the Arts Council for 1984-85 and received £46,000. So tightly were their figures drawn up that they regard the difference between what they needed and what they were granted as ""significantly less"" and as a rcsult have had to doctor their programme and estimates for the current vear to cope with the shortfall.
- If a book is priced at £1.00. the retailer will take 35 per cent; the representative or traveller will take 121/ 'per cent of 65p (the price less the 'bookseller's discount): the war'ehouse will absorb 15 per cent of, the net turnover of 65p; and the author will receive 1O per cent of the gross. Thus 63p has been eaten up, leaving 'the publisher with 37p to pay for all overheads and provide any profit..
Sarah Peel, Anvil's new salesman, and Peter Jay came up last autumn with a fascinating and detailed report on ""The Distribution of Poetry and Literature"" which ought to be made generally available.

Minor,
major, next Laureate?
Robert Nye
Death of a poet green sky,
rose glow
off Christmas-whitefields; woods bowed in ermine,
shefrailest stem snow-furred; berries burn their slowfire. the robin too -
his dancingJflame
warms through windows
Of course this is minor poetry, and Frances Horovitz would not have wanted us to pretend otherwise. But it seems to me authentic, the work of a gifted woman who responded poetically to life, and who - as the final poems show - faced the prospect of her own death with much courage.
* When Ronald Bottrall was young he was praised to the skies by Leavis. Since then - and maybe as a result? - he seems to have been ignorantly ignored by everyone else. Now,
There is a sonnct by Keats which celebrates ""calmest thoughts"" and which concludes with three images emblematic of such thoughts -
the gradtial sand that through an hour-glass rurns,
A wsoodland ri iulet, - a Poet 's death
I have always supposed that Keats had his own anticipated death in mind, or perhaps the suicide of Chatterton a generation before. Be that as it may, there is something memorable in the idea that a poet's death has a special power not so much to move and disturb, as to calm the mind and make it concentrate. It is a thought close to the spirit of A Celebration of and lfor Frances Horovitz 1938-1983
(New Departures 16, Piedmont, BisleY', niear Stroud, Glos GL6 7BU. f2 plus 50p postage and packing).
Frances Horovitz was a poet and an exceptionally fine and sensitive reader of other people's poetry - many who never met her must have known her voice from broadcasts on the radio. She died last autumn of cancer, at the early age of 45. This small book has been put together by her former husband, Michael Horovitz, the veteran enfant terrible. It consists of 30 uncollected poems by Frances herself, plus elegies and tributes by several of her friends, the whole being illustrated with family photographs. The result is beautiful and touching, a labour of love. I like especially the lively simplicity and freshness of her Snow poem:
at thc age of 78, he should at last take his rightful place among the English poets with the publication of his quite extraordinary volume Against a Setting Sun (Allison & Buisbv f4.95). I call the book extraordinary because the energy, vitality, and verve of the verse in it would distinguish it at any stage of any poet's career. Coming, as it does, so late in Bottrall's, and after so much public neglect, the book is a kind of testament to the indomitable nature of true poetry.
Not that all the undervaluing of Bottrall can be blamed on critical fashion. ... He is a difficult writer to appreciate in that he has not refined just one of his several manners so that its excellence is undeniable, preferring instead to conduct a dialogue with his own experience which comes out on the page as now lyrical, now satirical, now trivial, now profound. In other words, and they might as well be Martin Seymour-Smith's words, in his excellent introduction, ""each Bottrall volume, but this one most of all, gives the lively and candid record of a whole life, and it therefore breathes life"". I shall quote the whole of the short poem containing the phrase which gives the book its title, since its mix of vision and scepticism offers in cocktail form a sharp taste of this poet's mind:
Ever since the Statefailed to wither
I have never plugged my ears with wax
To block out the song the Sremns sing,
A song I've waitedfor years to hear.
Through a pilgrim's progress on its tracks
I hear it now and I am sailing
Happy towards those enchanted rocks
Framed against a setting sun that mocks
Thefewfadingflowers strewn on my bier.
* Another spectacular and heartening late flowering has been that of Gavin Ewart, now firmly re-established as the wittiest and wickedest living' writer of light verse in English. The Ewart Quarto (Hutchinson, £3.95) ranges from ballads and haikus and love songs to a Pindaric Ode on the Third Test played at Headingley between England and Australia in 1981. It is all light-hearted and ingenious, and some of it is splendidly filthy. May the poetry critic of The Times express the hope that Ewart be appointed the next Poet Laureate? He would, after all, restore to that office some of the true poetic importance of being Court Jester.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS185306801/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=a21c78a1

A well-.known author, who does not ask to be anonymous but for his own sake probably should be, writes to say that he has published. more than 20 books with various publishers and not once had difficulty in collecting earned royalties.

I know wvhy they do it - they are able to siphon offthe- interest that should be accruing in their authors' bank accounts. But justification. . .?""
He goes on to say that, in his iilnocence, he used to assume it took two or three months after the accounting period in question for the publishers to get all the figures in and make their calculations. He now believes otherwise, as requests to his publishers shortly after the last accounting period resulted in his being told precisely what sums he would receive in two months' time. ""Quite evidently the money - my money - lay snug in the publishers' bank.""
How naive some authors are. How do they imagine publishers make record profit figures?

reviews the poetry of the month
I take it that all right thinking chaps dislike anthologies, those sticky bags of other people's sweets where even the real toffee seems to lose its taste. Still, no bag should be thrown away which contains a piece of toffee like this:
The poetry that I admire
is light and easy. its a change
fron those big guns that duilyfire - though it has range.
it doesn't more in earthy boots or call on God to save its soul.
it s not obsessed wtith ils own roots, deep as a ,nole....
The poet is Gavin Ewart and the anthology the latest Arts Council effort, New Poetry 9, edited by Julian Symons (Hutcl2inson, £7.95). Ewart's poem, entitled ""Against the Heavy Brigade"", amounts to a manifesto in favour of the civilizing and confusion-cancelling properties of good light vcrse. It is witty and wise, and the nice thing is that Symons himself favours the kind of poetry here praised and practised by Ewart, with a result that the anthology contains a minimum of pretentious stuff. Roy Fuller, Barry Cole, Michael Hofmann, Vernon Scannell, and Derek Stanford stand out amongst the other contributors, all members of the Light Brigade, more or less - which is not to deny their seriousness, only to be grateful that they do not themselves advertise it with big guns and dull fire.
George MacBeth strikes me as a much improved poet these days, the palpable change of direction in his work seeming to have something to do with his removal a few years ago from London to Norfolk and his starting to write a smaller and
Gavin Ewart: model of the civilizing properties of good light
verse
more particular kind of poem about what he found there. This is not to say that this always splendidly sophisticated writer has settled for being a ""nature"" poet or anything like that, but he does appear to have discovered a home for his imagination and his verse is the stronger for it. The Long Darkness (Secker & Warburg, f5.95) contains poems in which matters of life and death are presented with the unmistakable authority of experience. Oncc upon a time MacBeth's work was dressed to kill but had nowhere to go. Now it gives every appearance of plain urgency, whether the poet is writing about the birth of his son, the death of a woman he loved, or his feeling that he has wasted his own talents.
It is this last theme, treated head-on, which inspires what is
for me the most moving and memorable poem in the book, ""My Father's Patents"":
Yyfather's patents in the dark
Their red seals shining, show the way.
Black-framed they rise. on velvet ground,
And succour me, from hour to hour.
These. in a far day, made some mark1
Worked more for honour than for pay,
And what their dead inventorfound Lives on in me, an inward power.
The delayed rhythm reinforces the note of awkward yet deliberate sincerity, as though the poet had arrived at his meaning slowly ,and with difficulty, having to overcome resistance in himself; it is only as the poem rises to its climax that the rhymes fall closer and more decisively together, as the sense demands. Here, as else-
where, MacBeth shows himself to be a real craftsman, and one for whom craft is subject to truth.
So is Sheila Wingfield, whose Collected Poems 1938-1983 (Enitharmon Press, £8.85 or £5.25 paper) is full of lovely things. Wingfield's work has been praised in its time by Yeats, by de la Mare, by Herbert Read, and by other fellow poets, but somehow she has never been given general public acknowledgement as the important and original poet which she undoubtedly is. The distinguishing feature here is the purity of motive which one feels behing nearly every poem - this poet does not write at all unless she has something to say which she believes to be unsayable except in terms of poetry, and if that sounds precious or high-flown just listen to her criticism of the process:
WIith palateforfine things but penny mouth,
I have to tell what sourness, drouth, Juice, or sweet, lodges in tihe core
Of those I learn from, groan with, like, or else deplore.
Seldom Ifeel - left on a tooth -
lfWisdom's honey or the wax of truth.
I like and admire the intensely active intelligence which gives quirky shape to that, and all through the book Wingfield's surprises are not the result of originality of manner but of originality of vision, which is of course what lasts and matters in the end. This is not light verse, but it is no Heavy Brigade verse either. It is verse which is just about the right weight for its own seriousness - which is to say, poetry.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS185568848/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=9bccdeb7

From Oasis Into Italy
Edited by Victor Selws-yn, Dan Davin, Erik de Mauny, & Ian Fletcher
(S/zepherd-Walwyti, £9.50, paper-back f5.50)
Somc fortv years after the end of the North African campaign and the Allied invasion of Italy ihe Salamader Oasis Trust has rescued poems, letters, diaries and drawings from combatants in these campaigns, depositing the originals in the Imperial War Museum. The uniqueness of the first anthology, Return to Oasis, and this its sequel, is that the contributors, the advisers, editors and authors, all served in the campaigns, and all contributions were composed during or shortly after the time of fighting: to ""put on record the facts and feelings of war"": There's cold here.
But it's the belly cold of night A tid it covers nothing.
Send snow
To cover and wvhziten the graves Thle yellow graves. (W. H. Burt)
The desert war had bv 1942 already forged its own myths, a landscape of the imagination comparable to that inhabited by the First World War poets and their fellows in the trenches: a world of fighting men in a barren terrain with little population to confuse the stark issues of battle and survival. This produced as the editors say a sense ""of space and freedom, often illusory... but nonetheless favourable to a feeling of inspiration, a desire to create.""
Loss of innocence had been a major theme of much First World War poetry. To the generation fighting the next war it was sad and familiar: bitterness emerges only rarely as in the Ist Army's sense that their sacrifice was not as glamorous as the 8th Army's at El Alamein. Once the Allies moved into Italy the soldiers encountered an ancient civiliza-
tion ""on which the British themselves had been bred, even unaware"" (editors). The effect of war on this and on the population was a new and disturbing element.
The richness of this collection is in its range of vivid experience from men of all ranks and backgrounds: some, like Enoch Powell and Harry Secombe, now well-known for other things, some good poets unjustly neglected, like John Jarmain, Drummond Allison, and Alan White, all killed, some artists like George Meddemmen and Ronald Cox. Its considerable achievement is to have made permanent the human significance of a great historical event

Quiet, crisp detachment
Fleur Adcock, born in New Zealand, has lived and worked in England for the last twenty years. Her verse is quiet, crisp, reasonable, and compact. If it lacks excitement - and it does - then I can readily imagine her claiming that as a virtue. It does not lack feeling and intelligence. The work in her Selected Poems (Oxford University Press, f7.95) presents a record of solid achievement, and it is good to note a certain progress underlying it. On the technical level this could be described as a movement away from strict classical forms in search of something that will approximate to the twists and turns of common speech. This development seems mostly inspired by the poet's awareness that she now has, quite simplv, more to say than when she began, so that it is no accident that the newer work admits a greater complexity both of thought and fieling. The overriding tone is thoroughly anti-rornantic.
Against Coupling does not find a place in The Faber Book of Love Poems, edited with an introduction by Geoffrey Grigson (Faber paperback £3.50), but not many moderns do. All the same, this is a fine anthology, rich in unexpected things as well as a whole range of predictable delights from Petrarch to Robert Graves, and it is nice to see Grigson insisting in his introduction that when Sidney wrote ""Leave me, 0 Love, which reachest but to dust"" he meant it - in other words, that good love poems have not been written to imaginary mistresses. There is one poem which I always look for, as a test or touchstone, in anthologies of this kind; it is by Drayton, and Grigson includes it, and I will quote the opening lines as a sort of answer to Fleur Adcock, or at least an Antidote to her irony:
So well I love thee, as without t}tee!
Love nothing: frl might choose, I'd rather die
Than be one day debarr'd thy company.
Since beasts, ald plants do grow, arid live and nove,
Beasts are those men, that stich
feapprove:.
He only lives, thatr deadly is in love.
No such passion disturbs the surface (or the depths) of Paul Muldoon's new collection Quioof (Faber paperback, £4), but then this is a book in which the pleasures are largely a matter of verbal sophistications of a private nature (its title, for instance, turns out to be his ""family word"" for a hot water bottle!). Muldoon has been highly praised, and he is certainly talented, but at present he seems content to use his talents working over rnaterial already better used by others - there is a long poem here ""loosely based on the Trickster cycle of the Winnebago In-
dians"", which is surely Ted Hughes' country?
The two hundred pieces in Alan Brownjohn's Collected Poems 1952-83 (Secker & Warburg, £8.95) have a distinctive personal voice all right, chatty, pleasant, clever, deliberately leveL. The trouble is that one never quite hears that voice saying anything to explain why its perceptions are being presented in the form of poetry. In a word, Brownjohn lacks inspiration. But, making allowances for that, there is an agreeable pleasure to be had from this book.

Ignore the professors and
forget the apology
Apart from wanting this poem instead of that, I have little to say about the contents of the fourth (revised) edition of Moore's book, except that at £4.95 for 600 pages it is the best general anthology of American poetry available here and should be bought and well sampled by those who like 'verse but are unfamiliar with its subject. About his introduction I am less sure. I hope he wrote it to please his publisher rather than himself Either way, its defensive tone must go.
Judging from the hostile comments quoted by him about his book's earlier editions, Moore's Apology - for that is what the introduction is - derives from his respect for that slew of Pommy literatoes anxious to badmouth American verse and at the same time to associate themselves with their betters (Milton, Wordsworth, and co). But who gives a bums berry for what Dr Wellaway, Queen Ethelfleda Professor of Poctry at Hufty Tufty Hall and the toast of literary Torquay, knows from the very shallows of his being about Carlos Williams
uP#N huln, E4.95
or Wallace Stevens? OnY his pupils suffer from his sensibility and his bent patriotism.
Since 1913 much American verse has been difficult for us to scan. I learnt hoW to do this by comparing Pound's earlier with his later work, and by listening to Americans who know how to read verse aloud. Once you know how to scan a poem by Carlos Williams, you know .enobgh to read those who come after him. One way to acquire ihis modest skill is to study Eloagy Carmichael's perfornance of Carlos Williams's poem ""Tract' issued on World Pacific Records (WP 1244) in the 1950s.
*the omission of Eliot's ""The Waste Land"" diminishes the value of, but does not spoil. Moore's fine anthology. He wished to include it, but Faber asked too much for his budget.
When the time oomes for his book's fifth edition, I am confident that Geoffey Moore will remember Marv Herbert and Emilia Lanier and so cancel his recognition of Anne Bradstreet as the first woman known to have written poetry in English. I would like him to scorn all that Brit Lit rubbish, to increase the amount of space given to poems that are the result of translation, and to reprint more comic poetry. Short items by Clarence Day, Margaret Fishback, Keith Preston, Gerald Kaufman and Willard Espy would please the customers. For example, this pair by the third and last of those just named.

This haystack is my ivory tower... Reading through the delightful Stevie Smith: A Selection, cdited by Hprmione Lce (Faber, £3.50 paperback), I kept remembering that sentence from thc poet's early Novel on Yellow Paper (1963). I'm not quiIc sure what it means. Something perhaps to do with art-as-haystack (making a heap of all you can find) and insistence on thc.artist's right to inhabit somc sort of ivory tower if thc artist happens to be, as Stevie Smith undoubtedly was, some sort of ivory person. Anyway, here in one volume is evidence of a' life well-spent looking for a needle in, this haystack that was also an ivory tower, and more than:a fevL good sharp poems written: .with the particular needle it was Smith's vocation to find:
The nearly right Andyet not rufte
In lore i5 wholly evil Anderery heart
Thal loves in part
Is monraged to the-devil.
Miss Lees antholoSy draws on the whole of Smith's output - poetry, prose, and drawings. I could havec done without the last, since they seem to me to misrepresent this writeres es.sential seriousness, but then it is admittedly a most peculiar seriousness, dancing on the edge of doggerel and whimsy, deriving its grace from a habit of never quite falling over. I thinl; it was John Berryman who once remarked that when Shakespeare said he had two loves of comfort and. despair he wasn't kidding. It is that'element of not kidding, even when she is kidding that I like in Stevie Smith: This book, with its.-helpf,ul biographical and textual, notes, should serve to introduce her to a new generation of students. I.trust they learn from it that the saddest poetry can be fmun to read.
Like Stevie Smith, the Scottish poet George Mackay Browvn is a writer who has established, an immediately recognizable 'manner. He %sritcs a kind of hard. clemental
verse, always conccntratcd in his native island of Orkney, celebrating its sights and sounds, its legends, its history and mysttry, thc smack of the sea and the shout of the wind. Unfortunriely, Brown's mastery of this matter seenis nowadays to allow him to manipulate it. His ncw collection Voyages (Hogarlt Press, £3.95) strikes me as pretty thin porridge. I have never much cared for the ""mystical"" strain in his work, the way hc constructs litanies of namnes and places, because it seems to me that he distances himself from rality by such ritual observances. A poem like ""Widowver"" shows him in a better light, perhaps because there are no candles, stars,. Magi, or Stations of the Cross decorating its simple statement:
Old Steplhcni thlir,e inters nowv Has spoken to none But his cat
.,nd the.spiderat the back of his bed Anld hinmself
And to a stone in the k-irkyard WVith thirteen names
*(The last cut sharp and deep).
Patric Diclinson's A Rift in Time (Chtatto d: WS'induts, £3.95) is that .-re thing: a book: of poems which seems all of a piece, a series of small private meditations on themes of sleep and death, oblivion and mnemory. Its mood is autumnal, its tone disciplined yet intense. Dickinson has never been a poetic showoff, and the gentle trance-like movement of his. verse here is wholly at one with a certain modest tenderness which I find deeply affecting. Nor is the book, despite its slimness, devoid of intellectual point Over against Plato's view of the J created world as an- imperfect imitation of a divine archetype, with 'its implication that. art is.trivial because it leads us awaY from the True, being.only mimetic, Dickinson sets a beautiful plea for the iniportance of human love as all we caxi 'now of the divine, and for the nedfulness' of poetry as giving a *memorable voice to such knovledge:
Is defined by shadowvsflickcring
n0 1hw xwall. 0 quick, comie in, Beassolidas youcan.
That is surely the vcrse of an old man wise enough. not to rage against the dying of the light, yet sufficiently sensitive and spirited to persist in secking to make poems of those flickring shadows which still define him. The achievement is solid gold, A small handful, but the real stuff.

Disfigured doodles
I notice that these days thc Scottish poet Norman MacCaig is much praised for his honesty, modesty, and wit. Reading his latest slim volume A World of Difference (Chatto & Windus/lTe Hogartlh Press, £3.95) it is not hard to see why. Here, for example, is the beginning of a poem called Run ning bull:
All his veighlt 'sforvard.
He looks like a big black hutnchback
withI a small black boy running behJind him.
Put an invisible sixpence on the ground...
he'll turn on it.
So don 't, if he's facing away from you.
People scatter. I scatter too.
Pleasant, amusing, with just enough originality in the actual description of the creature for us to feel that the poet is doing something more than show off his good humour. The tone and the manner are .typical. For the most part, these poems consist of empathetic descriptions of the natural world - sometimes a bit Disneyish, but no matter - matched to expressions of the writer's sense of being sonlehow an intruder in that world because he has the gift of translating it into images. It seems churlish to complain, but I do detect a disfiguring note of self-satisfaction in MacCaig's refusal to write about anything which might possibly disturb him at a deeper level. For a brief time, about 25 years ago, he seemed on the verge of becoming a major poet, a sort of twentieth-century John Donne, and we do his talents a disscrvice if we let him forget it. Elegance is no substitute for urgency, and too great a proportion of his recent work looks like doodling with his left hand while his heart has forty winks. To be fair, in a poem
called Enough included here, he appears to address himself to this specific criticism when he writes:
I don't want to shuffle in a Greek Theatre
chianting powverful platitudes
wlhile Nemzesis, off-stage, gouges and stabs.
But that is to load the dice. Nobody wants to shuffle, chant, or strut - only to engage again with the kind of truth-telling he cxpressed in his line hard feeling is true exercise for wit. Wit without hard feeling makes for whimsey, and I'm afraid that's what we have in the present book.
A similar charge could be brought against much of the work in Charles Causley's Collected Poems 1951-1975 (Macmillan, £4.95), but then Causley has always been a difficult case. At first sight, he seems naive and derivative, a writer whose frequent recourse to traditional ballad forms cheapens his own vision, achieving vigour at the cost of sensitivity. His best things, though, tell if not a different story then at least a more troubling and memorable one:
As ! walked dowvn by the river Down by tle frozen fen I saw the grey cathedral
With the eyev of a child of ten. 0 the railway arch is smoky As the Flying Scot goes by
And but for the Education Act Go Junmper Cross and .
That, I submit, is unmistakably the real thing, and even if the last two lines make you wince it might be worth considering that the poet intenids you to wince, to come down to earth with a bang. Here, in short, is a genuinely popular poet, who can sing both high and low, and whose finest effects spring from a calculated interlacing of the
romantic and the realistic. I should add that there is. also a note of sheer celebration in Causley's work which makes him unusual among other twentieth century poets who have called themselves Christians.
Donald Davie, for instance, seems in the period covered by his Collected Poems 1971-1983 Carcanet Press, f5.95) to have refound his roots in the Protestant tradition, but unfortunately this experience has not warmed or renewed his verse-making. Rather, his religion figures in poem after poem as yet another opportunity for inhibition. One piece cscapes, and has sufficient life to allow me to think that the poet in Davie has not quite been extinguished by his didactic critical intelligence - a strange poem called In the Stopping Train. This man in the stopping train tries to pass the time and comfort himself by staring out of the window at flowers, but even as he does so he accuses himself of knowing only their names and not their identities:
Jonquil is a sweet wvord. Is it ajflowerinig bush?
Let him helplessly wonder
for hours ifperhaps he's seen it. Has it a white and yellow flower, thejonquil?PHas it
a perf ume? O h his art could always pretend it had.
He never needed to see,
not with his art to help him. He never needed to use his nose, exceptfor language.
I find that alm6st too moving to quote in public. I only wish that this man in the stopping. train had written some of the other poems in the book.

Sources of inspiration
It is easy to miss the merits of Jenny Joseph. Her poems are quiet. They do not show off a personality. They make no fuss about tradition or modernity. They just are. And, like all real poetry, this means that what they are is neither old nor new, but seemingly remembered even the first time we read it: Lit the fire last night.
W'ished you were here,
Stared into the glowing coals; /Thiouglht of you, dear.
*,ood stretched alole by thefire Thinking, dear
A'icer things. very likely 7h/wan if,you'd been here
Joseph is not always as straightforward as that. But her Beyond Descartes (Secker & Warburg, £5.50) contains enough to convince me all over again that she is one of the most undervalued poets now writitig in English. Her material is honestly domestic, her manner slyly chatty; the originality of her vision seems the more disturbing because it comes in the guise of a few home truths.
Peter Porter first made his name as a ""social poet"" with a gift for satire. His Collected Poems (Oxford, £12.50) show that his talents in that line are authentic enough, but owe perhaps too much to fashion - the first two-thirds of this book read rather like an anthology of styles and attitudes common to the Sixties and early Seventies, preserved by Porter's wit and given an extra edge by his position as an expatriate Australian, an outsider, a dog among the fairies. His work seems to me to have changed direction in the last ten years or so, dating from about the time he wrote a fine poem called ""An Exequy"" in memory of his dead wife;
.4 map of loss, some posted cards,
The living house reduced to shards, The abstract hell of memory. The pointlessness ofpoeiry -
Theseare.the instances which tell
Of something which I know. full well, I owe a death to you.. .
It is significant that the title, metre, and rhyme scheme of this poem copy an earlier exercise in the same vein by Donne's friend Henry King. Porter is a highly formal and self-conscious writer. His latest work seems far more willing to put his skills to use in some attempt to come to terms with deep feelings, and he is to be applauded for that.
In his Later Poems 19721982 (Macmillan, £7.95) the Welsh poet and priest R. S. Thomas offers a comprehensive selection of work done since his Se[ected Poemns 1946-68, together with 43 new poems. While I respect Thomas as plainly an honest man and a good craftsman, I have to say that his case seems to me about the opposite of Porter's in that somewhere along the way his heart has settled for some comfortably stony point of rest where he can go on writing the same poem over and over refining it all the while of course, but never startling himself or his readers with the sort of truth that undoubtedly possessed him in the days of ""Song at the Year's Turning"" (1955). I make an exception of one beautiful poem, ""The River"":
A.nd the cobbled waler
Of the stream with the trout's indelible
Shadowvs that winter
Has not erased - I walk it 4gain under a clean
Sky with the fish, speckled like thrushes,
Silently singing among the weed's Brancdtes,
, I bring the heart
Not the mind to the inlerpretation Of their music, letting the stream C'omb me, feeling itfresh
In n.v veins, revisiting the sources That are as near nIow
As on the morning I set out from them.
There, for one moment, Thomas does indeed revisit the sources of his inspiration, and succeeds in sounding near enough to be inspired by them.

The flash of style
Charles Williams has a curious reputation. He died in 1945, leaving a handful of novels usually described as ""supernatural thrillers"", some unactable plays, a superb study of Dante entitled Th7e Figure of Beatrice. and several other books marrying literary criticism and theology. Auden apparently considered him a saint, and went on record somewhere as saying that a single meeting 'with Williams had been instrumental in his own return to the Christian faith. C. S. Lewis and Christopher Fry seem to have held similarly high opinions. But others have suggested that there was really something devilish about Williams, both in his life and his work.
Saint or devil, I imagine that Williams would best like to have been remembered as a poet. The Arthurian Poems of Charles Williams (Boydell & Brewer Lid: PO Box 9, Woodbridge. Suffolk IP12 3DF, fS.95) collects and reprints his two major efforts in that direction - the contents of the two volumes Taliessin through Logres and' The Region of the Summer Stars, first published in 1938 and 1944 respectively. What these poems amount to is an (obviously unfinished) sequence on the theme of the legends associated with King Arthur and the achievement of the Holy Grail. The poems are not presented as a continuous narra;tive, and instead of taking. Arthur or Lancelot or Galahad as his protagonist' Williams concentrates attention on a more obscure figure: the King's 'poet Taliessin.
I have found these poems fascinating for many years, but I still find it hard to say 'why. Often clumsy in rhythm and tebarbative in diction, 'they nevertheless manage to 'haunt the imagination both by reason of individual lines that seem to hold wisdom (Flesh knows what spirit knows, but spirit knowvs it knows) and by, whole passages -where imagery is brilliantly pressed into . service of an ldriginal vision. As evidence of
the last, take the poem where Williams imagines Taliessin
commanding Arthur's troops in wars. In a moment of vision, ""a passion of patience"", snatched, from the. centre of the battle, Taliessin is suddenly inspired with thought of Virgil finding the exact words for a line in a poem, sees in his head the Roman poet dash at the wax with his pen, and points his own spear in identical inspiration at the one point in the enemy lines which will yield:
Civilized centuries away, the Romnan
moved. .
Taliessin saw theflash of his styie dash at the Ivax; he saw the
hexameter spring
and the king' sword sswing; he
saw, in-the longfield,
the point wvhere the pirate chaos
might suddenly yield,
the place for the law of grace to
strike.
That seems to me radiant and. tremendous. There is so little radiance and tremendousness in twentieth century English verse that I do not care to let it pass without commendation.
Down at the Low Church end, so to speak, Gavin Ewart goes his mischievous merry way. More Little.Ones (Anvil Press, £3.50) is a further collection of the 'marvellously. witty and invariably filthy poems which he seems able to turn out these days without -any perceptible effort.
There was an oldfellowv called Ewvart whose verse some despised as a blue
art 7
but those with more learning, more clearly discerning.
all recognized it as a true art.
I think it is a true art, no kidding, and that Ewart is a past master of the craft of being light-hearied without- failing into silliness. His subjects are Sex- and Writers. Most of the stuff in the first category is too hot to- quote, but here is, one firom the second which made me laugh out loud; a -complete poem called ""Seamus Heaney"". He's very popular among his mates.
I think I'm Auden. He thinks he's x Yeats. --
On. reflection, it's\ not a bad world that gives us Charles .Williams and Gavin Ewart in oneweek.

Naughty

The' French poet Paul. Ve1laine spent a good part of the last ien years of his life in hospital. Nothing surprising in that, when you consider the multiplicity of diseases he was suffering from: syphilis, diabetes, cirrhosis of the liver, cardiac hypertrophy, and infectious erysipelas. What is surprising is the amount of work he managed to get done in this period, writing 12 separate books of verse and prose. It seems that hospital life suited him, and that the nursing staff were kind, allowing him to scribble away at night wben the rest of the ward was 'asleep. Without doubt the most remarkable things he did in these conditions are the two sets of poems Fenimes/Hommes, now translated - into English by Alistair Elliot (Anvil Press, £3.95 paperback;).
These poems are obscene by any standards, not least Verlaine's own. The first set, celebrating the female body. were published clandestinely and over a pseudonym. The second. doing a similar service for the male, only appeared after the poet's death. There is still no good modern edition of them in print in France, and only six of the poem's are in the Pl]iade Verlaine. So it is especially to be welcomed.that Mr Elliot's book provides the full French text on its left-hand pages. As for his English versions, they: seem tfo me admirable - reproducing the technical zest and virtousity of the originals, as well as their vigour, their good humour, and their often manic high-spiritedness. The result is something like the best of Rochester - to seek for an Anglo-Saxon equivalent - though of course it has more in common with (say) the pornographic fiction of Apollinaire. 'Unfortunately, if inevitably. most of Verlaine/Mr Elliot's best effects are quite unquotable in a newspaper, so i have to cite the beginning of the shyer ""Triolets for a 'virtue in excuse for mine being small""-as an example of the translator's
skill:
G*reat length and breadth in wi'lhat Vou feel
Is different fromn how deep it goes.
I wouldn 't claim for iny appeal Great lengthl and breadth in what you feel.
That for Verlaine's:
.4 la grosseutr du sentinent
A'e la pas mnesurer ma force. Je nepret,ends acutnement
.4 Ia grosseur du sentiment.
appears to me quite a noble atlempt to do the impossible. Elsewhere, Mr Elliot shows verbal resourcefulness equal to -his sensitivity in the matter of metre and rhyme, finding home-grown slang equivalents for Verlaine's richly gross erotic argot. Altogether, I must say that I found this little book a work of subversive brilliance, -giving great pleasure, right down to the slyly erudite and riddling notes in the back - e.g. page 131:""Why would the French call the arse a schelingophone?""
I wish that I could be similarly enthusiastic about another recent translation from the French, especially as it is ten times as ambitious. This is a new version of the complete text of Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du Mal, done by the American poet and critic Richard 'Howard, and Published in a handsome volume with illustrations by Michael Mazur (Harvester Press, £I8.95). The trouble with this effort is precisely that Mr Howard for the most part eschews rhyme, whereas Baudelaire always rhymed 'vhen he wrote in verse., Now it is of-course possible for a translation not lo follow the rhyme schemes of its original and still succeed - -1 would instance C.. H.. Sissons's. Englishing of The Dii'ine Comedy a couple of years ago, whicl even read the better for not attemptInggto pretend that Dante's terza rima can . ever be echoed at length . in English without the translator looking like a clown limping along. behind,a ballet dancer. hVbat goes wrong with Mr, Howard's, Baudelaire is that hisU- strong metrical paterns .mak-e one expect and anticipate rllyines, and. then no, rhyme

Grigson the Poet
Sebastian Barker is a hard poet to pin down with critical tacks. It would not be difficult to suggest that he is just plain awful - all of his books to date have contained a high quota of unsuccesful lines. bathetic images, stuff which a more careful writer would have consigned to the wastepapcr basket. Barker is not careful, he is passionate. He takes risks, he makes a fool of himself by trying to tell the whole truth. In his best work, as in his worst, he always gives a sense of thinking at the nib of his pen, working things out on the page writing like Forster's old woman in order to see what it is that he wants to say. His latest book A Fire in the Rain (Martin Brian & O'Kee/te, f3.9S paperback) is very much in character, a kind of outpouring checked bv craftiness. It confirms my feeling that Barker is the real thing, a genuine poet not just someone writing verses on the side.
That feeling, however, can scarcely be justified by quotations, and it falls to a reviewer to try and explain why this is the case. The book looks like a collection of individual poems, but it is really a single poem with a single theme. That theme, in Barker's own words, is ""about adaptation to alien environment"". The alien environment is Bracknell New Town in Berkshire, and the adaptation is that of the poet himself since he went to live and work there as Writer-inResidence at its Arts Centre. Unpromising stuff, but Barker plugs away at it, refusing either to despise or sentimentalize his new-found landscape of shopping centres and multi-storey car parks, celebrating the people in the place, finding meaning in their being there, making himself their voice.
It is a modest and in my
opinion honourable thing for a poet to try to do; the energy which Barker brings to the task has to be seen to be believed; there's a totally involving sense of storil to the whole: and the sequenice goes from strength to strength, culminating in two long poems which attain an almost visionary intensity. In the first of these Barker comes up with a line which I take to be central to his undertaking: Hell i.s a sutbutrb under a clawv of a foot ot( God. In the second he declares of language, personified as The Muse: She is the /Brackn/ell of Inv itmagination, even as Brackliell is the Bracktie11 of Her iomagitiation. Those two quotations must stand as indicative of the high seriousnless of this extremeiv talented young poet. The book should be bought and read by anyone who can recognize the genuine article.
So should Geoffrey Grigson's Collected Poems 1963-1980 (Allison and Busby, £9.95). This is Grigson's own culling of all he has written since his earlier collected volume of twenty years ago, and those who have missed the powerful upsurge of his gift since then are in tor a most pleasant shock. Grigson has perfected a quirky yet satisfying poetic idiom immediately recongnizable as his own. Flis strength is in how close that idiom comes to living speech, and the speech of an honest man with something true and uncomfortable to say:
Love. for which there werefew useful rhymes,
A,nd which came only at times,
IWe wrote of like priests writing of God.
Moonlight silvered a sea alley, Rain sparkled into a valle y,
Love shiould be there, we said was there.
.-And it was absent almost everywhere.

Geoffrey Grigson:
Blessings, Kicks and Curses;
The Private Art
A Poetry Note-Book
(Allison & Busby, f9.95 each)
Geoffrey Grigson was at Oxford in the Twenties, among the budding poets, you-know-who. In 1931 was published Leavis's New Bearings in English Poirv and one might have supposed young Grigson would have approved. Of course not, for he had to ""do his own thing"" and he soon started his little mag, Neitw V1erse, excellent in its narrow way. But Leavis and Grigson have in common that they are not ""critics"" in a way that Gosse would have understood the word. They arc propagandists: extravagant in appreciation, and depreciation. Leavis settled for genuflection at the shrines of Hopkins. Pound. and Eliot. Grigson isn't so sure about Pound but adds the young Auden. Incense hangs hcavy in the air. But, do vou see. Grigson ""discovered"" Auden. In both these writers there seems this necessity to be in first. to be the possessor. almost the captor, of their chosen poets - I might say ""'pets"" for there is a lovelv misprint of ""pem"" for ""poem""
in Grigson. The tolne of""only-lknow and if you think otherwise you're a fool"" pervades their works. Thev know the poems from the pems. Most of us now, and in the past. write pems.
Rcprints of reviews, radio talks, lecturcs, etc. (which are cphcmeral) do not make a book, nor should they - unless the quality of their writer's mind is outstanding. The reprinting of' old and new vonornous animosities offers disturbing questions best left to thc psychiatrist's couch. ""An intellectual hatred is the 'worst"". wrote Yeats for his daughter (a late poem and thereforc GCrigson-approved). ""'So let her thinik opinions arc accursed."" Grigson's work is top-heavy witli hatieds and opiniioins and like Ihc Mary Rose or the. Royal Georgc all that happens is that too many cannons are brought to bear and down he and his crew must go; but he is the onc saved. He has so many good things to say. His championship of Crabbe or Clare or Campion is admirablc: vet he cannot sec that his judgments arc vitiated by the silly poisons he pours inlto one's ear about his pathological hatreds. Whv should one believe opinions onl Clare. coming from a critic who has no use for Emily Dickinson. Isaac Rosenberg, or Keith Douglas?
His poetic note-6bok is full of not very sage jottings, ""For a poet brains of a high order are only an advantage. They arc not cssential.'Think, of Walter de la Marc;"" Wasn't this really the moment to think of himscif? Grigson is a wriicr of fantastic almost grotesquely wide reading. Chincaes is no! Greek. to hiiri, nor Russian, French, nor probably Albanianf
His obsessions with the hitherto-unknown are remarkable and often, vcry endcaring.
He *vould have made a testy,. eccenitric don, and have Icctured well on. thousands of pems; he might eyen have been a Professor of Petry - save that he has an atrabilious detestation of dons. Perhaps he sees himself as a onc-man Universitv - both Vice-Chancellor and perpetual student.
But no. this is not it. Tolerance and love and humour and humility have somehow evaded him. In these books one hcars too loudly ""the thin high rarc continuous worship of the self-absorbed."" He is jesuitical at heart. Who cares how many ""bad"" poets burn? And on the jackets of these two books he is made to look like a sort of Graham Greene.

Soothing familiarity under
a subversive guise
The Penguin Book of
Contemporary British Poetry, edited by Blake Morrison and Andrew Motion (Penguin, £1.95)
This is an anthology, not of the best contemporary British verse, but of the best publicized; although its editors would like it to be placed in the subversive tradition of Ezra Pound's Catholic Anthology and Al Alvarez's Thte Neiv Poetry, this is in fact a rather soothing collection. It is much more itl the tradition of vcrse albums for light hours, such as Poems fbr Travellers or Poets on Chiristmnas.
The introduction is heady with talk about a ""new spirit"" to bc found in contemporary poetry. I am not sure about that, but certainly it would have to be a free one to cover work as diverse as that which has been assembled here - from cxamples of Northern Irish poetry to the productions of the young Oxford poets. Catchphrases which include the word ""new"" should be treated with caution, and here they are only
a form of whistling in the dark. The editors havc simply included the poets they admire (and I admire, along with them, Fenton, Reid and Adcock) but seem hard pressed in finding reasons for doing so.
And so when they talk of this ""new spirit"" as being also the ""spirit of post-modernism"" I do not think they know what they mean. Post-modernism, as a descriptive term, has been indiscriminately applied to English poetry for at least 40 years - Eliot, the archmodernist, was also the first post-modernist, although he was rather clearer about his reasons. If the term were to mean anything in the context of
this book, it would register only a newv"" lack of ambition.
The Oxford poets, * for cxample, take a familiar theme or vista and then attempt to transform it by strangeness of description: the poem becomes a special, because slightly jokey and slightly whimsical, way of looking at the world. It confirms, in other words, its own marginal status. This happens, characteristically, at times when poetry itself is surrounded by other and more dominant forms of expression - and it is revealing that the best work included here is close to journalism, or to the short story.
Most of this Penguin selection, however, is conventional in form and familiar in cadence - agreeable certainly, light and decorative. Any of it could have been published in the last 40 years without arousing the slightest objection.

"Applevard, Bryan",Interview: Geoffrey Grigson,The Times,1982-Nov-04,"London, England","THE ARTS
Interview: Geoffrey Grigson
The survivor of English modernism
In his notebook. published today, Geoffrey Grigson writes of the hunt for a cicada in the foliage of his rosemary patch. It is an image of the search for the elusive persona of the poet. His rosemary patch is Broad Town, a village in a fold of some of the few hills in Wiltshire, the idyllic dualities of which are somewhat qualified by thc militar-y air bases dotted around the vicinity. His foliage is poetry, a plant in which he has been thoroughly cntangled for thc past 77 years. With the exception of painting he speaks of anything other than poets and their work with uncertainty or amusement.
He is the most typical survivor of that peculiarly English version of modernism whicih flourished in the Thirties under the aegis of Auden. They were a less apocalyptic band thian the more cosmopolitan originators of modernism, visualizing themselves as part of a continuous English tradition rather than as presiding over the collapse of western culture. For them Joyce and Pound were gigantic figures certainly, but slightly dubious, somehow not entirely to be trusted behind the hard carapace of their leaming. There was even something ambiguous about the enticing gravity of T. S. Eliot.
But thc homc team was magnificent: ""If vou think of'tlhe people you could sharpen your claws on at the time - Herbert Read, Henry Moore. Bcn Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth - and you never knew who you'd meet if you went to a party with Read, there was liable to be somebody like Gropius there . . . or Ben Nicholson coming round in an Austin 7 with Braque. He always swore it wasn't an Austin 7.. .
""And then a kind of rot began to set in, the Sitwells, Dylan Thomas; the intellectual edgc went."" He searchcs round for a moment for a contemporary artist worth his praise. ""Hockney is a verv remarkable painter - yes?""
Surprisingly, Grigson's spoken opinions emerge uncertainly. Thc ""yes?"" which ends most of his critical assessmnents is a request for agreement, a flattcring hope that his listener will approve. It is surprising if you have read his essays, in which he belabours his enemies - ccrtain academics, Pound, Thomas and all book reviewers - with something close to pitiless contempt. He quotes Coleridgc to justifv his written rage: ""Praise of the unworthy is robbery of the deserving - it's a very good flag to hy under.""
And, of course, thc quality of his derision makes his adulation for the small band of those he regards as deserving all the more profound, morc sweeping. ""Nicholson and Moorc - they werc superior people, you kinew they were in earnest, vou knew that they were doing what thcy should be doing and doing it as well as they could. You knew they weren't cheats and you could sce their relationship with thc past, this sensc of communitv going back to God knows when, to
(rigson: a quality of derision
paleolithic times. And you really felt they weren't playing at it. That was life.""
These days he has to struggle to find their like. Hockney apart. He suspects .James Fenton may be a worthiy poet, but hle is unsure. Generally thotigh he dislikes miaking contemporary judgmnctis, feelinlg it is not the role of an cider statesmani like himself. Yet he clearly bemoans the contemporary loss of seClioulsllCss.
""I was at this party at Fabers - in theirniew boardroom - it was to confirm Matthew Evans as manalging director. It was all there with the ghost of Eliot in thc eorner. Two slightly shabbv. I'aded-looking bunny girls came in to deliver a Kissogram for Evans. I mean, after all it was the hoardroom of the author of Thie llasic l aiad(. I remennber the start of'the 'gram. It went: 'Thank Evanis tor little books.' Oh deIar.""
Kissogranis apart. (irigson is not one to let his anger or his derisioni turn inito gloom. In his poetry and in his prose he is an incurable celebrator of all that lie finds worth celebrating. It is enough for him that Auden lived or that his belovedt gallerv of' mine minor poets - Clare, Barnes. Campion anld 1'raherne - are there to be outind. Or even that there might be many moie lying
undiscovered in the Bodleian or the Britishl Musetim.
""I don't think anybody believes the atoimi bomb is going to go off. But even if it (toes there will be some embrvonic poets in Platagonia or Australia.""
With tihe publication of three books this week Grigson is keeping up his usual rate 01 outptit. The poems between 1963 and 1980 are collected, and his second collection of' essays appears. And for the lirst time hie has brought out his notes in a volume entitled Thle Priatwe .lrt. He was inspired by the notebooks of Valery.
It contains an odd mixture of lyricism, common sense and happy abuse; buit. most important of all, it containis a lot of (irigson, the cicada peeping out of the loliage:

The Occasions of Poetry
Essays in Criticism and Autobiography
By Thom Gunn
Edited by Clive Wilmer (Faber, £6.95)
The Passages of Joy By Thom Gunn
(Faber, £4 paperback £3)
""Man, you gotta Go. "" At Cambridge in the mid-Sixties I remember we backed Thom Gunn or Ted Hughes, just as we backed either The Stones or The Beatles. Gunn was definitely the Heavy Metal side in those days - the Metaphysical Kid, with all those motorcycle poems, the leather heroes, Elvis and Marlon and Dean (already coolly retro), the Existential Lover growling ""Even in bed I pose"", the ""toughs of history"", Corialanus and Von Stauffenberg, Byron and not Shelley, and the unforgettable ""Sad Captains"" who withdrew to an orbit and turned ""with disinterested/ hard energy, like the stars"". (The electric half-rhyme, ""failures""). Well, I still think that's how you should start to learn poetry: intellectual excitement plus rhythm.
In fact Gunn was already way ahead, living in San Francisco, discovering communes and body contact and LSD, and wrnting the much freer syllabic verse of Touch (1967), and then Moly (1971) - moly being the magic herb (sure) that Hermes gave to Ulysses before entering the dangerous, beautiful zone of Circe, where tough explorers became sloppy, sun-worshipping swine. Some critics felt that California had indeed changed Gunn into something of a poetic pig, the old Yvor Winters' precepts of Energy and Rule, swamped by the hot, laid-back, far out West.
Now Thom Gunn is 53. He has published eight major books over nearly thirty years, and his career makes a distinct and significant shape in the development of modern British poetry. He describes this shape with modesty and great charm in the autobiographical sections of The Occasions of Poetry, his first collection of prose pieces and critical esssays dating between 1965 and 1979.
The shape is indeed Circean, because it consists of a series of transformations. He moves from Cambridge to San Francisco, from a cold culture to a hot one; from strict metrical forms to lesser syllabic structures that concentrate on ""spontaneous perceptions""; from guarded heterosexual poetry, to the openly homosexual; from a kind of pop existentialism, concerned with ""identity"" and ""pose"", to a deeply felt exploration of tenderness, physical sharing and emotional trust. He tells us a great deal about his parents (especially his mother, who died when he was fifteen), about his intellectual influences, about his friends.
The collection also contains essays on Ben Jonson, Fulke Greville, William Carlos Williams, and Gary Snyder (a typically Gunn-like piece of flexible rostering), together with one of the best studies of Thomas Hardy's ballads I have ever read.
As for the new book of poetry, it marks a fascinating if diffuse growth of Gunn's muse: another layer, a new skin, but patchy and raw in places. The title comes from Dr Johnson: ""Time hovers o'er, impatient to destroy, / And shuts up all the Passages of Joy"" (The Vanity of Human Wishes). The prevailing mode is elegiac, a turning back and remembering, which is perhaps one of the dominant modes of the late Seventies.
Thom Gunn: back home
Some of the shorter poems will I think stand among the best he has written: ""The Cat and the Wind"", about the processes of perception and inspiration; ""The Conversation"" which might bear comparison with Edward Thomas's poem to English Words; and ""June"", a deceptively, simple lyric about the sustaining nature of love.
There is also a near-perfect sonnet based on young Keats's meeting with the aged Coleridge at Highgate. It is a dialogue between Youth and Age, but also to some extent between Gunn and his critics. In the first part, Coleridge notes that Keats is ""Loose, slack, and not well-dressed"". Here is the second part, the sestet, with Keats walking home:
He made his way toward Hampstead so alert
He hardly passed the small grey ponds below
Or watched a sparrow pecking in the dirt
Without some insight swelling the mind's flow
That banks made swift. Everything put to use.
Perhaps not well-dressed but oh no not loose.
It adds a peculiar resonance to know that Thom Gunn too, grew up on that Heath. Man, he had to Go, had to get out. But he has found himself, I think, back home in the only tradition that matters.

""His images have an admirable violence"", wrote Edwin Muir, in a review which. helped to establish . Ted Hughes' reputation, as it were overnight, when his first volume The Hawk in the Rain appeared some 25 years ago. The violence has. since struck other critics as less than admirable. If Shelley was guilty of sentimentality in hailing the skylark as a blithe spirit, then there may be a mere inversion of this attitude in Hughes crying:
I suppose you just gape and let your gaspings
Rip in and out through your voicebox
0 lark
But this is to criticize Hughes, as his work demands, from the highest level. He is a serious and authentic poet, restless in everything save his commitment to poetry. This fact comes out loud and clear from his Selected Poems 1957-1981 (Faber Â£4.95, Â£2.50 paper).
Made by Hughes bimself, this selection draws' on all published wotk to date, and*
in particular it supersedes the similar volume of 1967 by giving generous representation to the seven volumes from Crow *to Under the North Star. It thus provides an authoritative introduction to a possibly major poet. If I sound. less than certain irk admitting him to that status, it is because for. my money Hughes has never really surpassed the excellence of the early poem which begins this book, ""Thought-Fox"", a poem which is as much about the act of writing a poem as it is about the animal which provides the poet with his focus. The- fox enters the poem with a fine physicality: Brilliantly, concentratedly,
Coming about its own business
Till, withl a sudden sharp hot stink of fox
It enters the dark hole of the head.
Yet Hughes is on record as telling how he wrote this poem in a room in London, after a time when he had written little or nothing, and it is clear from the context that the fox's physical presence as it enters the poet's imagination is being identified with the influx and. effect of inspiration itself:
The window is starless still; the clock ticks,
The page is printed.
The ""violence"" in such a poem is well-contained in a cage of words. I find it preferable in every way to the strutting, ranting, and spilling which characterizes Crow and its derivatives, but I may be wrong.
Karol Wojtyla is also unignorable, but hardly for poetic reasons. If he had not been translated into being Pope. John Paul II then I am sure that his-Collected Poems would not now be appearing in an English version by Jerzy Peterkiewicz (Hutchinson, Â£4.95 paperback). These shy, rambling, worried; and - it must be said - interminably prosy verses are probably no real index to the Pope's mind. But I suppose it is something to have a failed poet occupying St Peter's chair, and not so very surprising that the poor chap sounds like Stephen Spender, returning again and again to images ot eyes and light and frontiers and electricity. He
is best at his most Spenderish. Thus:
Electricity here is fact and symbol.
I look through eyelashes into the eyes:
light through a transparent grove.
The only thing that is not Spender is the title of the poem which gives rise to this - ""A bishop's thoughts on giving the sacrament of confirmation in a mountain village.""
Ronald Duncan's Collected Poems (Heinemann/Quixote Press, Â£10) is hugely ambitious - wilfully so, in the manner of his mentor Ezra Pound. Duncan has always
taken risks. They are the risks which a poet of vision ought to take. Unfortunately Duncan is not a poet of vision, but a minor poet writing about vision. I like him best at his most honest, modest, loving, and hopeless: when he sounds like a little Elizabethan born too late, as in this complete poem entitled ""Epitaph"":
Here lics my Mother
My loss, her profit.
My wuhole life's buried here
Chuck earth upon it.

New Songs from a Jade Terrace
By Anne Birrell
(Allen & Unwin, Â£15.95)
Golden orioles pass through green boughs. I whisper my passion to the lipstick on her mouth. Spring passes, he has not returned; she watches blossom all turned to leaf. Clearly the old, old malarkey of love poetry; but exotic and mandarin, wouldn't you say? Not quite your Ted Hughes. The 656 poems in this famous anthology were written between 14 and 18 centuries ago, in the era of Chinese history known as the Southern Dynasties. They were collected by a court poet, Hsu Ling, around the year 545, and became for China what Palgrave's Golden Treasury was for Victorian England. This is the first unabridged and unexpurgated translation into a Western language.
And it is a strange door into the boudoir that they open for us, my masters. This is a melancholy, claustrophobic world. Lovers seldom meet in the poems. A woman is always waiting in obsessive longing for a man who is off down the road of life, often eager for his next amorous encounter. It is a polite world. Breasts, buttocks, hips, and genitalia are conspicuously absent: contrast their prevalence in Sanskrit and-Occidental love poetry. Instead lipstick, slee-
ves,and belts become erogenous zones.
The imagery is complex and alien. For us a dragon signals a virgin-eater that' needs to be slain by a hero on a white horse. On the jade terrace your dragon is a fertility symbol; or and also the emperor; or and also the celestial courser of a divinity. The jade terrace of the title can be a platform for dancing, or the haunt of a sexy mountain goddess, or a mirror-stand. The poems are dense. with puns and allusions that would fly over our heads without the notes.
So what is there in them for us, a world away in time and space? Critics of mainland China call them a poetic disgrace, and worthless, as the product of an aristocratic society. ""The sound of a state in collapse""; ""not for gentlemen""; they have been criticized for mannerism shallow conventionality, tedious cleverness, excessive allusion, pretentiousness, and ornateness. In fact, as well as opening a bamboo curtain on the romantic conventions of traditional China, they show that the Chinese heart in love beats much like hearts in that condition the world over. Dr Birrell's scholarly and tender translation of these love poems of erotic decor, decorously erotic, fulfils the purpose of the original compiler, old Hsu Ling: ""For long hours be diverted."" -

Poet as terrapina
Roy CamDbeli
A Critical Biography
By Peter Alexander
(Oxford, £12.50)
Although he was a prolific writer, publishing fifteen volumes of verse between the years 1924 and 1954, Roy Campbell is not now generally thought to have made an outstanding contribution to English poetry. While specimens of his work appear in some anthologies, notably 'The Faber Book of Twentiethi Century Verse, he is probably best remembered for the youthful epigram which he was prompted to write by the popularity in his native South Africa of the novelist Sarah 'Gertrude Millin:
You praise the firn restmint with which they write -
I'm with you there of course:
They use the snaffle and the curb all right,
But where's the bloody horse?
Royston Dunnachie Campbell, to give him his full name, was born in Durban, Natal, in 1901 to parents who were both of Scottish descent. His father was a prosperous doctor. In spite of his being badly treated by the 'headmaster of Durban High School and of being less keenly addicted than his four brothers to hunting, shooting or fishing he appears in the main to have had a happy childhood, displaying an apttude for drawing and painting as well as for writing verse.
After an unsuccessful attempt to run away and enlist when he was only 15, Roy Campbell left for England as soon as the war was over. He failed to obtain the academic qualifications for admission to Oxford but made friends then with William Walton and T. W. Earp and through them with such people as the Sitwells, Aldous Huxley and Augustus John.
He had one or two homosexual affairs but was more attracted to women and in 1922 he married Mary Gorman, a beautiful girl, also the daughter of doctor and three years older than' himself. They were very poor and lived in a small cottage in Wates where their eldest daughter was born and Roy completed his first book The Flaming Terrapin. The terrapin was supposed to be a symbol of male energy and the poem was favourably received by the critics for its romantic verve.
The Campbells returned to Durban for the years 1924-6, a period which saw the birth of their second daughter and Roy's father's death. On their return to England they rented a cottage in Kent in

But Xor ili its venom and the' range of its targets the poem seems not to have drawnX much blood.
By 1929 the Campbells were back' together in Provence. Four'-years later they moved to Spain where they were both converted to Roman Catholicism. L-iving in Toledo, the became ardent partisans of Franco in the Spanish Civil War, in which Rsoy falsely claimed to have *fought. He did write propa-
anda mainly in the form of a ;lastily written poem entitled ""Flowering Rifle"". What was probably harder for him was a year's abstinence in fulfil-' ment of a vow not to drink alcohol until Franco's victory.
His espousal of Franco's cause brought Roy Campbell into conflict with the group of young English poets whom he collectively satirized as Macspaundey. His 'main charge against them was later to be that they were non-combatants in the Second World War. This was true of him also, though he often pretended otherwise. He joined the army and rose to the rank of sergeant but was prevented from fighting by ill-health.
After the war Roy worked for a time at the BBC finding a congenial drinking companion in Dylan Thomas. Then in 1952 the Campbells emigrated to Portugal where Roy spent most of his time working hard at making translations from Spanish and Portuguese. In 1959 they suffered a car accident on their return home from spending Holy Week in Seville and Roy was killed. Mary lived on until 1979 holding his memory in affection.
Mr Alexander tells this rather sad story competently mostly letting the facts and numerous auntations sneak
tor themselves.

""The poem,"" saiys the poet, ""is concerned with language on a very plain level"". An unremarkable statement. But the poet saying it. is John Ashbery, master of that New York school which flirts with nonsense, delights all fans of the difficult and the obscure, eschewing any kind of clear subject matter. Ashbery's friends and disciples throw words at the page much in the manner of Jackson Pollock hurling paint at a canvas, with results about as interesting as the average Rorschach test. I think it worth insisting that Ashbery himself has another dimension. The content of his work may be elusive, but the structures have grown increasingly formal, even beautiful. The fifty poems collected in Shadow Train (Carcanet, £3.25) are each of them sixteen-lines long, governed by immediately distinctive and memorable rhythms, and above all possessed by a sense of humour which makes even their most hermetic moments agreeably modest. Ashbery has been compared with Wallace Stevens, hailed even as a
'philosophical"" thinker. I regard this as a serious misrepresentation of his gifts. An English reader is more likely to be reminded of Edward Lear: there is a similar manic despair informing his jokes apd inventions, and the tension between that concern with language on a very plain level and the hectic refusal to come clean about whatever it is that pricks him into verse in the first place makes for some extraordinary effects, the finest of which do not preclude tenderness.
George MacBeth's Poems from Oby (Secker & Warburg, £4) shows a writer who was once as cosmopolitan as Ashbery trying to break new ground. Only one poem in the book, 'Thoughts on a Box of Razors"", -harks back to the familiar MacBeth in its preoccupation with violence, menace, the poet as a sort of Jack the Ripper stroking his own wit as it it were a knife with which he might do unmentionably nasty things to his Muse. For the rest, the tone is domestic, the setting pastoral, and the mood rather wilfully contented. MacBeth has apparently settled down in a Norfolk rectory, calmed his imagination by concentrating on country matters, and decided that it is time to take risks by rhyming flowers with showers, and stavihg off melancholy with: verses like this:
The blend of ecstasy and filth
In smell of drazns, an robin-song, Offers the kin of fruitful tilth
In which a poem might grow strong.
In my opinion, the tilth is not yet fruitful enough to make these poems strong, but there are sufficient successes (e.g. the excellent ""To Preserve Figs"") to make me hope that MacBeth will continue to cultivate his rural garden.
P. J. Kavanagh has always been a poet who seems equally at home (yet intelligently uneasy) whether in city streets or muddy ploughlands. His Selected Poems (Chatto & Windus £4.95) isC a very fine book indeed, and leaves. me in no doubt that. the time has come for, a reassessment of the reputation of this unambitious btut most accomplished writer. Kavanagh (who is the son of Ted Kavanagh who wrote the scripts for ""Itma"") has sometimes spoiled or fudged poems of undoubted inspiration by turning aside into gags at his own expense, but his critical mind has performed a first-rate. job: in choosing for this volume the best things from the five books he published between 1959 and 1979. He writes well about happiness (which is rare); his love poems are never sentimental; most remarkable of all, he has the knack of turning the simplest nature note into something which goes beyond observation of the outer weather - and to do this without being portentous. Here is a complete poem, ""Sun Overcast"", which illustrates that last gift:
W'ien brightness leaves the trees they seem to fall
Backwards, deprived of shadows, then rise again in a coot
Diminishment of waiting, solider still. Which it is possible
Is what they mean whom death makes audible
Beyond our ears and, I feel, as simple.
I remember the late James Reeves, praising Edmnund Blunden for having a Muse with an ""unpresuming Saxon grace"". Kavanagh's has the same grace. She may never be fashionable, but I'd wager she has a Persistence which will survive this fashion and that.

Tony Harrison is a poet. He is also, so it appears, something of a one-man industry. Now 44 years old, and engaged on a sonnetsequence in roughly Meredithian form, he is at thei height of his powers, pouring out poems and translations and finding publishers for ali this idiosyncratic and (occasionally) magnificent work. We have grown so used to the Larkin Syndrome - whereby a poet publishes a slim volume perhaps once in a decade, as if to prove the worth and difficulty of opening his mouth at all - that Mr Harrison's energy makes him look alarming. Yet the flux of his production is at one with the fury of its content. I take off my sceptical reviewer's hat to him, convinced that I am in the presence of the real right thing.
First, his version of The Oresteia of Aeschylus, first performed at the National Theatre last November, and now offered in book form by Rex Collings Ltd (E3.50). This is vivid, gutsy, and agglutinative. I take the last adjective from Ezra Pound, who used it to define the special qualities of the original (Literary Essays of Ezra Pound, page 273), while bewailing the fact that a search for Aeschylus in English is ""deadly, accursed, mind-rending"". Mr Harrison does not mess about. He goes straight for the original glue and renders it in a sort of sticky, eccentric, slanginspired English. Orestes instructs Pylades to ""keep out of eye shot""; the Chorus turns to Cassandra and mocks her ""painpangs and griefsongs"" with the nasty retort, ""Don't understand"". To which1 Cassandra, only doing her job after all:
Off with the brideveil then. Look into truth's pupils
The truthgust. It's rising. Blowing .4fresh headwinds
sweeping sea-ripples into dawn's molten caul.$ron,
then building a woe-wave as big as a mountain.
I don't much. care for ""woe-wave"" (sounds like Gilbert Murray glued to W. H. Auden), but this is to pick holes in a translation which undoubtedly makes Aeschylus alive again. As the Chorus grudgingly admits to Cassandra: . ""It's as if you'd witnessed all You're describing."" Mr Harrison has grasped' -and rendered the very essence of Greek drama: that; it. takes p lace without ceasing- in a theitre of the humian soul. More, :he has found contemporary English words and idiomatic rhythms to match it. A remarkable achievement. I reckon Pound might have approved.
His U.S. Martial (Bloodaxe Books, PO Box 1SN, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE99 1SN £1) is slighter, but stilf extremely ilvely and impressive. Here are 18 translations from poems by Marcus Valerius Martialis, made in March last year while Mr Harrison was staying in New York. The best are obscene and truthful enough to be unquotable. All of them find a happy medium between Martial's epigrammatic disgust with the social and sexual life of Rome round about the time of Christ, and Mr Harrison's feelings about his predicament on Broadway last year. Witnesses number XVI, entitled ""The Joys of Separation"", which can be quoted in full:
She wants more and more and
more new men in her.
He finally finishes Anna
Karenina.
And lest this suggests that Tony Harrison is only a kind of Woody Allen of modern English poetry, have a look at his exquisite A Kumquat for John Keats (Bloodaxe Books, 75p). A kumquat is a Chinese orange, gold in colour, with sweet pulp and sour skin, or perhaps the reverse, sweet outside and sour within.... Mr Harrison plays deliciously on the doubt:
For however many kumquats that
Ieat
I'm not sure if it's flesh or rind
that's sweet,
and being a man of doubt at life's
mid-way
I'd offer Keats some kumquats
and I'd say:
You'll find that one part's sweet
and one part's tart:
say where the sweetness or the
soumness start.
This single poem should be sufficient to convince any fair-minded reader that Tony Harrison's is a most considerable talent. It has much to say about Keats, about poetry, about life's brevity, about its co ensations (which may well include brevity and Keats), and about the fruit which can also be spelt cumquats. It deserves to be preserved in many anthologies. And at the same time it has to be observed that Mr Harrison is such a restless and original poet that if he goes on at this rate he will prove to be an anthologist's nightmare. Good.
Selected Poems of Alun Lewis (Unwin Pa'perbacks, £2.50), selected by Jeremy Hooker and Gweno Lewis presents in the chronological order of their writing the best poems of one of the best poets killed in the Second world War. Lewis has always -had his admirers, but he has tended to be regarded as somewhat School of Grgves (for no substantial stylistic reason, but because Grgves -> who never met him - helped to select and then introduced a posthumous volume of his work). He may now be seen as a decent, unpretentious, persistently serious writer, aeeply concerned with what he perceived to be ""the single poetic theme of Life and Death"". Less literary than Sidney Keyes, more accomplished than Keith Douglas, his death (which seems to have been accidental) deprived English poetry of a potentially important voice. Not Just a War Poet. A poet.

Greek Poetry
From Homer to Seferik
By C. A. Trypanis
(Faber, £25)
""Greek poetry constitutes the longest uninterrupted tradition of the Western world"" Professor Trypanis declares at the outset of his monumental history. For the first time it is possible to follow the whole course of this triumphant progress from the Geometric Age to the end of the Second World War. He has himself described it as a book more of love than scholarship; the affection is plain to see but the erudition and the assiduity of research are equally staggering.
Another way in which Greek poetry is unique is that it starts off with its greatest poet, Homer; one wvho is also arguably - I should argue it vigorously - the greatest European poet. Instead of the forceful but naive fragments which stand at the fountain heads of other literatures, here are two works of art, the Iliad and the UdysseV, which combine integrity of structure and elaboration of design with a heart-piercing directness and vigour of elocution. The language too is in no way primitive but aristocratically sophisticated. As used by Homer it is a perfect instrument which, as Goethe said, does your thinking and your poetizing for you.
Professor Trypanis, a patriotic Chian who has both geld a chair at Oxford and been a Minister of Culture in the Greek Government, is specially qualified to expound the continuity of Greek culture. He can both trace the dominating influence of Homer on education through two and a half millennia and exemplify 1
sympathetic understanding for the generation of poets vhich has given the world Cavafy, Seferis and Elytis. His book is, in fact, not unlike a dumb-bell, with a serviceable but rather thin handle joining the two important elements, antiquity and modernity. He is very good on good poets - hut no doubt more amusing on the mediocre ones. When he dismisses Hermesianax as ""easily the worst of the early Alexandrian poets"", a hairraising categorization, no-one will risk checking his judgment.
It is in the Byzantinechapters that he is most at homne and, for the -British reader, most valuable. He deals effectively with the great pronunciation change, complete by the fifth century, and the change from quantitative to accentual verse in the tenth. He argues convincingly that Romanus the Melodist was the greatest Byzantine poet. The Cretan school of the seventeenth century, the Klephtic ballads of the eighteenth and the poets of the lonian islands of the nineteenth (who fell heavily for Ossian, like so many of their Western European contemporaries) are discussed and assessed with easy skill. One other element of continuity comes through. The feeling of despair which lies, in C. S. Lewis's words, only an inch beneath the bright surface of Homer is as close to the surface in the poems of Cavafy, even of Seferis. The best Greek poetry is inspired by the sense of transitoriness of all human endeavour an inspiration sublimated by Pericles when he said in his last speech that all things are subject to decline but the memory of greatness lasts for ever.

I tnderstatd you well enough, John Donne ....
Thus, C. H. Sisson, now 67 years old and in my opinion the finest living English poet, addressing a letter across the centuries to one of his peers. The occasion for this poem was that Donne was once rector of the parish church at Sevenoaks, from which town Sisson (in his days as what they call a higher Civil Servant) regularly commuted to London. Comic coincidence? Of course, and the human comedy is never far from the surface of what inspires Sisson, as it inspired his predecessor. Another reluctant Christian - ""eaten by lust and by the love of God"" - it leads him to the emphatic, passionate, shocking orthodoxy of this poem's conclusion:
Come down and speak to the. men of ability
On the Sevenoaks platform and tell them
That at your Saint Nicholas the faith
Is not exclusive in the fools it chooses
That the vain, the ambitious and the highly sexed
Are the natural prep of the incamate Christ.
If, as I do, you detect in those lines the voice of an authentic poet impelled to find a personal way of uttering some more-thanpersonal truth then you will want as many copies as you have friends requiring Christmas presents of Sisson's Selected Poems (Carcanet New Press, f3.95). The book draws its 53 poems from the three major collections In the Trojan Ditch (1974), Anchises (1976), and Exactions (1980). The selecting has been sensitively done - the only serious omission being the crucial ""The Discarnation"".
It is worth noting that Sisson was a late starter (he hardly wrote a line of decent verse before the age of 40), and that when he did start lhe first began to reach such a public as there is for new poetry through the pages of a magazine called X: A Quarterly Review, edited by David Wright and Patrick Swift. That was round about 1960; ""X"" is long since defunct; and I cannot recall if the younger poet Tony Harrison (born 1937) ever appeared in its pages. Whether he did or not, I see that David Wright went on record at some point, hailing Harrison as ""the white hope of English poetry'} - a perceptive tip, now proved soundl by the
appearance of Mr Harrison's Continuous (Rex Collings, f3.953, a selection of 50 sonncts from a still proliferating sequence collectively entitled ""The School of Eloquence"". Harrison employs a 16-line form, like Meredith's but with a different rhyme pattern. He is technically a master of his craft. and the content of the sonnets - broadly speaking, a self-critical analysis of his relationship with his working-class ancestors extended into an examination of the difficulty of all communication - has the necessary drama, the story-line, to make the book very readable as a whole, and not just as a series of isolated witty linguistic exercises. Three cheers for mute ingloriousness! he proclaims, only halfironically, in a sonnet called ""On Not Being Milton""; and elswhere, in an epigraph on the subject of heredity, he shows himself to be wellaware of both the power and the impotence of his own predicament:
How you became a poe's a
lWhel-ever did you get your talent from?
I sap: I had two uncles, Joe and Harry.-
one was a stammerer, the other dum!,.
It is heartening to find a poet prepared to take risks,
to indulge himself in the frank expression of his private thoughts and feelings, somewhat in the manner of George Barker in his heyday, staking all on the quest for whatever might emerge from the struggle.
Andrew Waterman's Out for the Elements (Carcanet, £3.95) is chiefly remarkable for its lengthy title poem, written in the intricate stanza fornm which Pushkin used for ""Eugene Onegin"", and like Harrison's sonnet sequence in that it moves through much personal matter to unsentimental and highly unfashionable general reflections on human nature. Waterman, though, is less eloquent, more intellectually calculating, even solemn, and I found myself wishing that he could have made room for the kind of good-humoured gaiety which surfaces in the book's lighter pieces, such as this punning verse from ""Meeting the Poets"":
""Dyer?""-- ""Well, rather awful, yes.""
""A keside?"" - ""Gut's heaving."" ""Dunbar?""- ""Foch, bar's lang closit doon. ""
""Sassoon?""- ""Ys, must be Icavr.g. ""

Devilish
epic
Robert Browning: The Ring and the Book, edited by Richard D. Altick (Penguin English Poets, £10);
Robert Browning: The Poems, edited by John Pettigrew, supplemented and completed by Thomas J. Collins, two volumes (Penguin English Poets, £10 each).
Anyone who has finally lost patience with BBC 2's Borgias might profitably turn to Browning's The Ring and the Book. This is what a real master can make of devilish Italian costume melodrama. Browning's source was an ""old yellow book"", part printed pamphlet and part printed manuscript, which he found in the junk stalls of Florence one June morning in 1860.
The crumpled vellum covers - pure crude fact
Secreted from man's life when hearts beat hard,
And brains, high-blooded, ticked two centuries since.
The Book told of a Roman murder trial of 1689 - a genuine cause celebre - involving a jealous husband, a whitewashed wife, a prancing priest, a pack of lies and loveletters, an elopement and adultery (the Grand Perhaps), and three singularly bloody killings with Genoese stilettos (the blades hooked back with teeth for tearing, flesh). The excitement and Nthe alliteration is instantly contagious.
From these peculiarly raw materials Browning fashioned - in the terrible black years following Elizabeth's death in 1861 - a truly remarkable blank-verse poem in 12 books. It has been called the last full-scale poetic epic in English, a real challenge to the prose of Dickens. It remains remarkable and astonishingly readable for several reasons. Browning used his mature technique of dramatic monologue, of writing from within the persona of his characters (""Porphyria's Lover"" 1836; ""Bishop Blougram's Apology"" 1855), to tell the same story from nine different viewpoints, thus presenting nine different and conflicting varsions of the ""truth"" - with the reader alone left to judge and justify. (Gadzooks! alliterating still, the prosy punk!)
The sinister husband Count Guido, the dying wife Pompilia, the priest, the legal councils, the onlookers, the scandal-mongers, and even the wise old Pope, thus speak to us directly with their passionate pleas. It was a: techniqfie taken up by Wilkie Collins in The Moonstone, and explored by many modern writers since, such as Pound,
Eliot, Lawrence Durrell and John Fowles.
Through this daring method, Browning transformed a blowzy domestic melodrama into a real investigation into the nature of fact, fiction, and human bias and prejudice. The subtle distinctions between motive, act, and intention (more than ever questioned in our present lawcourts), are brilliantly displayed as each witness appeals to us in turn. The complex sexual relationship between the 50-year-old Guido and the 17-year-old Pompilia is moved gradually and deftly to the centre of the poem (Guido is allowed to speak twice, the second time his death-cell ""confession"" - of a sort).
In the end we are given a view of the relativity of human and historical truth that is rarely associated with Victorian psychology, or poetry. It seems contemporary, for all the tapestry and daggers. Most interesting of all (""tremendously interesting"" said Henry James) is the fact revealed by Professor Altick's extensive notes, that Browning himself falsified the documentary truth - in pale Pompilia's favour, of course, identifying her perhaps with Elizabeth:
Womanliness and wifehood opal'ine,
Its milk-white pallor, chastity, suffused
With here and there a tint and hint of flame,
Desire, the lapidary loves to find. Read on, read on.
Penguin have also issued, in two massively splendid volumes 6f over- 1,100 pages each, an entirely new scholarly edition of all Browning's other poems. Four volumes might have been more elegant, but the editorial machinery is excellent, and the copy-texts are taken from impeccable sources, including, I see, a gravestone in Saint Mary's churchyard, Barnsley, Yorkshire.

Scars Upon My Heart: Women's Poetry and Verse of the First World War, selected by Catherine Reilly (Virago, £3.75)
This story of women's poetry is not so immediately dramatic as the familiar one of the soldier -poets, the patriotic fervour soured by bitternessthat produced the acrid poetry of the trenches. Indeed the male poets' indignation at the women at home is weU;lknown because oDf Wilfred 0wen's savage answer to Jessie Pope's jingoistic. ""The Call"", included - here. Yet' the emotional climate in the early years of the war confused both sexes; as Iris Tree
records, ""we dare not weep who must be brave in battle"". The stress of anxiety and loss created a longing for simple certainties which it is easy for later generations to misunderstand. Both men and women sought to invest their experiences with a significance that would make it bearable, and it is interesting and moving to see the women grappling with the received notions of honour, duty and sacrifice that were increasingly opposed by feelings of loss and grief.
High heart! High courage! The poor girls they kissed
Run with them: they shall kiss no more, alas!
As Judith Kazantzis points out in her introduction it is crucial to comprehend the ""half altruistic, half romantic"" emotions charged with patriotism and a longing to be of service underpinned with religious beliefs that affected both sexes. Women did not have the possibility of direct participation in battle which always offered an acceptable path to the men even when they had lost faith in the war itself, and it. is not surprising that many of them embraced the traditional role of bearing pain on their menfolk's behalf, as in' Vera Brittain's poem to her brother beginning ""Your battle-wounds are scars upon my heaFt-. I Many of them- identify the soldiers' sufferings-with tihose of Christ (as indeed did Wilfred Owen) and Mary H. Henderson !invokes ""Mary Mother of God/AIl women tread where thy feet have trod"".
The physical propinquity that fuelled the homoerotic impulse in much of the poetry! from the trenches also crystallized for Sassoon and Owen their anger at the barbarity of war which transformed their attitude and their poetry: that anger was often directed at the conventions of love and sacrifice, ""the stained stones kissed by the English dead"". That physical contact was denied to the women and becomes available to them again as they, are increasingly called upon to care for the wounded:
The covers on.the screen are red
The counterpanes are white and clean
He might have lived and loved and wed
But now he's done for at nineteen.
As do their male counterparts the women also begin to question the ultimate ends of war. Edith Sitwell, Marie Stopes and Margaret Postgate Cole:
So our memories are only hopes that came to not
.we are-left atone like old men; weshould be dead ...
-Most of these writers have moments of insight peculiarly their own,.- transcending any deficiencies inevitable in such anthologies:
His son comes in like a ghost through the door.
He'll be ready, maybe, for the next big war.

Nobel poet of the hungry heart
The Nobel Prize-winner for Literature in 1979, Odysseus Elytis, arrives in London next week to take part in what can only be called an Elytis Festival. On Tuesday he is the guest of honour at a luncheon given by the Greek Ambassador to a chosen company of British philhellenes and lovers of poetry. On Thursday he receives the honorary degree of Doctor of Literature from the University of London, at the hands of Her Royal Highness Princess Anne. On Friday there is an evening reception at the Greek Embassy, and on Saturday he is with the Arts Council of Great Britain. At their shop in Long Acre beween 2:00pm and 3:30 he will sign copies of his Selected IPoems, a collection from his work over the past 50 years in English translation, chosen and introduced by Edmund Keeley and Philip Sherrard. The book is due to be published in Britain on the 26th by Anvil Press Poetry Ltd, who have already published last year the poem generally regarded as his masterpiece: To Axion Esti.
It must be rather an ordeal for a man always modest and averse, since his youth, from
publicity. I say since his youth because in 1935 when he was a student in Athens he took part in the first international surrealist exhibition which was arranged there that year under the inspiration of Andreas Embirikos and other surrealists connected with the paper Nea Grammata. I remember the, stir it made in Athens at the time although I can't claim to remember any of the exhibits. Since then he has pursued his art with faithfulness and assiduity, taking from surrealism the love for fantasy and the freeflowing stream of ideas which was what exhilarated him in his youthful reading of Paul Eluard, and adding to them a gravity which has its base in a deeply felt Hellenism.
His family origins are from the island of Lesbos, but he was born in Heraklion, the capital of the then independent state of Crete, in 1911, one year before Enosis. The family name was Alepoudeli. The first element in it means ""fox""; *as Archilochus said, the fox knows many tricks. His pen-name Elytis is close to the ancient word for ""scabbard"" or ""case for a spear"" (or a crab's shell) but his admirers connect it with
the first syllables of the words for Hellas, or hope or freedom. All three are concepts which could serve as keynotes for much of his poetry.
His first poems were published in literary magazines in Athens and Salonika. In 1939 he brought out his first collected work Orientations. WVhen the Italians invaded Greece in 1940, he joined the army as a subaltern on the Albanian front. His experience marked him strongly. The war was fought in winter in tangled and hostile mountains. The Greeks were indifferently armed and equipped, and sup,,ly was difficult. Most of the time the daily rations amounted to a loaf of bread and a handful of olives. There was exhilaration from victory, and the liberation of old, lost centres of Greek civilization, followed by the collapse when the German invasion rescued Mussolini.
These experiences are reflected in the poem he published in 1945, Heroic and Elegiac Song for the Subaltern Fallen in the Albanian Campaign. lie published little for the next 14 years, part of which le spent in Paris. Then came in 1959 his best known
and probably his best work, To Axion Esti. The title recalls a Byzantine hymn and means ""It is worthy""; it is also the name given to a famous icon of the Virgin.
The Greek language is infinitely flexible and euphonious. Greek poetry has the longest continuous history of any in Europe; the whole of his heritage is available to the poet of today. In this long work in three parts there are elements that recall the classical writers, the medieval liturgy, the poems of the War of Independence and the work of the school of Seferis, Gatsos, Engonopoulos, and others whose revival of lyric poetry in the thirties was initiated by the publication in 1931 of Seferis's prophetically named The Turning Point.
Elytis is a serious as well as a sensuous poet. He has said himself: ""I consider poetry a source of innocence full of revolutionary forces. It is my mission to direct these forces against a world my conscience carnot accept; precisely in order to bring that world, through continual changes, to be more in harmony with my
dreams. '

I hear that it is already beinig said that Sylvia Plath was essentially a minor poet on the grounds that her Collected Poems (Faber £1O, or £4.25 paper) reveal that she wrote a number of poems less powerful than the ones which took the literary world by the roots of its hair in the posthumous volume Ariel (1965). This reviewer begs leave to differ. Seen in *context, the verse which poured out of Plath in the last year of her life is not diminished. Its impact is still terrible and terrifying: The woman is perfected. Her dead
Body wvears the smile ofaccomplishment,
The illusion of a Greek necessity....
Those lines begin what Ted Hughes now tells us was her final poem, dated 5 February 1963. Six days after writing it, the poet put her head in a gas oven, and accomplished the death she wanted. Let me make what I am trying to say quite clear: Plath's achievement as a poet did not require her suicide; yet that suicide was inevitable. There is a price to pay for each poet,
and Plath knew the cost of her own obsessions. Look again at the lines quoted. ""The illusion of a Greek necessity."" Only a major poet could have got things that correct. Because this collected volume shows that Sylvia Plath had to work hard at her craft, writing a number of Parnassian poems in order to find her own voice, it should not be assumed that shie is a lesser poet than the final ""perfected"" poems prove lher to be. It remains only to be said that Hughes has edited and introduced Plath's poems with tenderness, tempered by exemplary reticence. Forget the legends and the gossip. Here are the facts. Facts which amount to some of the most hair-raising and heartstopping poetry written in our tinie:
Dying
Is an art, like everjthiing else. I do it exceptionally weiL I do it so it feels like hell. I do it so it feels real.
I guess you could say I've a call.
D. J. Enright must occupy some colour at the other end of the spectrum. His Collected Poems (Oxford £10) shows him to be a poet who has made an art of avoiding whatever it is that irks him into verse. They call this irony, and of course it was fashionable to be ironic in the
Fifties (when Enright began). Listen:
Only one sttbject to write about: pity.
Self-pity: the only subject to avoid. Hlow difficult to observe both conditions!
The surprising and pleasing thing is to find that Enright's self-conscious intelligence has not allowed him to turn a shrug into a grimace. His verse has improved with the years (which is more than can be said of most of the Fifties' writers), and at his best he can now write poems which are at once perfectly intelligible yet manage to imply the mysteries they refuse to explain. His faults are a certain slickness - he can be too neat and entertaining. But be only falls into this trap when he forgets his own excellent prescription for the writing of decent verse: Yozu need defeat's sour Fuel for poetny.
Its motive power Is powerlessness.
Bernard Spencer died in mysterious circumstances in 1963 - he was either struck down by a railway train, or fell frdm the door of another. The ambiguous nature of his death is somehow all of one piece with his verse. The Collected Poems, edited and with an introduction by Roger Bowen (Oxford f8.50), reveals him as a typical poet of the
Thirties and Forties, a traveller, a man finding nostalgia for some never-quite defined ""home"" in his sense of exile when in Palermo, Madrid, Athens, or Vienna. This is a piercingly unhappy volume, for Spencer seems always to have written well when inspired by deep depression:
Ifowu many times have you smiled a reckoning smile
Either when there was some quest on of money
Or to humour one of the dead wvho live around?
That begins a poem called ""Evasions"". Unfortunately, the next line reads: ""Oh, but that's been going on since the world began."" In other words, Spencer strikes me as a poet impelled into verse by much the same pressures as worked the oracle for Norman Cameron, but whereas Cameron (a far finer spirit) did not turn aside into ballad-like refrains which dodge the issue, there was always a certain glibness in Spencer which made it easier for him to complete a stanza, while avoiding the original impulse. All the same, this is a welcome and moving book.
Brian Patten's Love Poems (Allen & Unwin, £6.95) are not really love poems at all, unless infatuation with the possibilities of smart metaphor can be considered sufficient to persuade a woman into bed and a poet that he is
telling the truth. I was impressed by individual poems by Patten, and this book appears decorated with praise of mine to the effect that he is a poet of ""great lyrical tenderness"". I apologize, but I now withdraw that praise.
The lyricism is there, all right, but I was misled into thinking that the tenderness was truly applied to the object. Most of these poems are addressed to Patten with love from Patten. They are heartless.
John Heath-Stubbs's Birds Reconvened (Enitharmon Press, £3.90, or £2.55 paper) is small fry ornithology by a poet capable of greater things. But at least he concentrates upon the birds, rather that on his own ingenuity. He has this to say about the heron:
standing,
Not in his greyi stillness,
VWatching the waters for his prey - but all in motion,
As he tries to get into his snaking gullet
A flapping, wvhite-bellied, obstinate cuss of a fish.
Of course, one can't be sure that herons see it that way, But it seems likely. And I reckon John Clare might have approved the attempt to see the thing from the bird's viewpoint, and the precision of language.

Norman Nicholson was born in the small town of Millom on the west coast of Cumbria. Now 67 years old, he still lives there. If poetry begins at home then Nicholson has strong claims on the attention of any serious reader. Not that he should be considered as a ""local"" poet, in the sense that his work would make most appeal to his fellow Cumbrians. He writes about what he knows best - the people and the places round about him - -and over the years he has dug deeper and more directly in search of not just his own roots, but some ,common. human root which might make sense of it all. Sea to the lWest (Faber £5.95, paperback £3) reveals him at the height of his considerable .powers.
Here, as you might expect, are poems about a world of ,rock and stone, becks, walls, dunes, Scafell Pike, shadows ,and clouds over combes. Nicholson picks over and pokes at his own particular -patch with the assurance and assiduity of a twentieth -century Wordsworth. That comparison is inevitable. But it is where the two men part companV that Nicholson begins to be most interesting. He has a fine poem, for instance, called ""On the Dismantling of Millom Ironworks"", which begins as a kind of quarrel with his
I
predecessor for averting his gaze from ""the charcoal-burning furnacelSited like a badger's set deep in Duddon woods"" - in other words, for rejecting the poetic possibilities of the Industrial Revolution in the name of Nature - moves on to celebrate, with much attention to detail, the ugly but sensuous reality of this ironworks where:
my father's father,
Foremran of the back furnace, unsluiced the metal lava
To slop in fiery gutters across the foundry floor
And boil round the workmen's boots
but comes to the conclusion that now that the ironworks has been dismantled:
maybe the ghost of Wordsworth, seeing furthier than I can,
WVill stare from Duddon Bridge, along miles of sand and mud-flats
To.a peninsula bare as it used to be, and, beyond, to a river
Flowing, untainted now, to a bleak depopulated shaore.
The language is flat and unambiguous, but the poem as a whole seems inspired by a splendid uncertainty very truthfully expressed. Is that ""bleak, depopulated shore"" really to be preferred to the human reality and even the peculiar beauty which Nicholson found in the .ironworks of his childhood? Is he being ironic when he says that Wordsworth's ghost can see further than he can? Or acknowledging that there is a false romanticism in his own nostalgia for what, after all, was a filthy blot on the landscape? The poem troubles the reader with such questions, and is the stronger for not offering easy answers.
Nicholson is certainly no mere daffodil-lover. In lighter vein, he has a delightful poem in praise of weeds:
Even the names are a folk-song:
Fat hen, rat's tail, cat's ear, old men's baccy and Stinking Billy
Ring a prettier chime for mne than honepsuckle or jasmine,
And Soweet Cicelt' smells cleaner than Swveet W'illiam though she's barred from the garden.
Nothing is barred from Nicholson's garden. That's why I like him. And if that garden is small, what matter? The soil's rich, the roots go down deep, and the gardener has green fingers.
Dannie Abse probably cultivates a window-box in Hampstead. A practising doctor as well as a poet, he seems from his verse to be a thoroughly urban man. Way Out in the Centre (Hutchinson £5.95, paperback £2.95) is his first selection since that eyeopening ""Collected Poems"" four years ago, which showed Abse to be a much more various and accomplished poet than most of us had believed. The new book more than confirms that impression. Here are poems which worry away at the complexity of human relationships (husband/wife, father/son, doctorlpatient), others which deal deftly with Abse's heritage as a Jewish person who has worked out his own stance as a somewhat apprehensive humanist, and best of all a handful of splendid poems in which the poet observes the doings of the streets of London, lights going on in the suburbs at
night, the mystery of unoccupied office towers, people going about their business, scraps of overheard talk. Perhaps this sounds boring? I can only quote to show that it is not. Here is the beginning of a poem entitled ""Another Street Scene"" (outside the grocer's, Golders Green Road):
They quarrel, this black-bearded man and his busy, almost flying wife
she with her hands, he with proverbs.
I find that almost perfect, and irresistible as narrative. If one test of a good short poem is that it should grab the reader by the buttonhole from the first three lines, then surely Abse has mastered a difficult art. He is a story teller in verse, a poet who keeps his ears and eyes open and offers item after item which rings unmistakably true. The result could be merely clinical, the poet-ascamera. But the quiet compassion, the. sheer likeability of Abse's habitual tone makes him avoid that pitfall. I recommend in particular the poem ""A note to Donald Davie in Tennessee"", the last five words of which give this book its excellent title:
I too am a reluctant puritan, feel uncasy
sometimes as if I travelled without ticket.
Yet here I am in England way out in the centre.
Three for Water-Music (Carcanet, £2.95) offers Donald Davie himself, that same ""reluctant puritan"",
with a little sequence of poems, at once quirky and formal, in which Arethusa and Phoebus crop up in some unlikely contexts, e.g. ""the England of silver/cigarette cases and/Baptist chapel on Sundays."" Unsurprisingly, this gives rise to a thicket of exclamation marks. Her father's brother rapes her! A poet's lie! A boy turned to a newt! Those ejaculations begin three separate bits of verse. Wow! I say! Hang it all, Bob Browning! Has our reluctant puritan turned into the Owl of the Remove? The volume also contains a reprinting of ""The Shires"", that pedestrian tourist exercise in which Davie seeks to celebrate the counties of England. Having just experienced a bit of Cumberland through the eyes of Norman Nicholson, I turned with some interest to what Davie had to report. He begins:
I tend to suppose the part I know least
Of England is the north-west.
For the sake of the rhyme alone, I could wish for his sake that it had been the north-east. Never mind. He goes on to delight us with the information that he spent his honeymoon in the Lake District. And concludes:
Thnts in my memories. North-west, I know Vou least, or best?
A poet's tease! East, -west, leasf s best! Perhaps he make up his mind sometime? I recommend a dose of Norman Nicholson.

The best part of the first half of Lyics of the Hearthside is that it makes way for the second half. It may have taken Joseph Mydell as much thought and research to put together the first half, but it does not show. With access to all Paul Laurence Dunbar's poems and letters, he does notinng more than make a quick survey of Dunbar's attitudes to his American life, summnarizing his reactions to the War between the States, to black life in the South and in the North - and
to read well and slightly dramatize a selection of writings that illustrate those attitudes..
Mr Mfydell is considerably more successful in the second part. He takes hold of the material with a finer relish, and connects it so that it tells something. of the man in the actual context fo his life. Where he began with simple performances of the material, no more genuinely informative than any reading might be, he touches the spirit of Dunbar after the interval.
Dunbar, born in 1872, was ,virtually the first black American poet of real international note. His lyrics .frequ.ently sang with rhythms that still escape most white writers and his influence extends now to jazz singers, such as Oscar Brown Tnr, and to Stevie Wonder: Mr Mydell links those rhythmns to his performance with stylish assurance once he stops cata-

I think it was Christopher Logue who once characterized the drabness of the Engiishb Movement poets of the 1950s as being like the antics of two bald men fighting for possession of a comb. His own verse has always had Plenty of hair. Ode to the Dodo (Cape £6.95, or E4.50 paperback) selects the best of it.
He began, in the days of that Comb War, as an unfashionable dandy, a peacock strutting in para-rhymes, a poet of night and cloaks and tambourines. fie has refined the romanticism, as they say, and nowadays is more likely to take his inspiration from the Police Courts. His work is witty, well-turned, and makes its appeal instantly or not at all. To my owrn taste, he has never surpassed the excellence of the moving elegy ""For My Father"" which was inciuded in his first. book W'Zand and Quadrant (1953):
Spider
how can I get his most, most gentle Voice,
across the sacrament of death? Ant,
from the spire of that grassb,ade,
can y,ou see larger absences than his?
Blackbird
behind the marbloom, what is there new
beside the pearly wake of snails,
for me to put upon this paper stone?
""Ah!""Ife would say, ""you should have heard me sing,
before I broke my shotilder wA istling. ""
The wvhole poem does something quite rare in an elegy: it makes its subject live in his own right, and not just an occasion for grief.
Some of the early poems have been revised, not always to their betterment. Speaking from memory, the fifth line in the sixth sonnet frori the collection Devil, Mfaggot and Son (1956) has been spoiled. That line originally spokc of the poet as ""A most modern ape on his bare knees"", wvhile it now calls him an ""instantaneous ape on hairpin knees"": the revision ruins a memorable absurdity. It was made, I daresai, because Logue now finds the naivety of his first insniration disagreeable. But his -naive poems, early and late, are by far his best. There are enough of them to make this an outstanding collection.
George Fraser, who died last year after a life largely devoted to being a friend to other poets and to poetry itse3f, left a legacy of verse which has now been edited by Ian Fletcher and John Lucas as POems of G. S. Fraser (Leicester University
Press, £7.50). Bcginning with Hoome Town Elegy (1944) and ending with Conditions (1959), Fraser published quite a body of interesting work on his ow-n lifetime. But the real riches here come from the uncollected poems he wrote in the i970s, after he had retired from the London literary scene. These things -- usually conversational, often couched in the form of celebrations of poets who were his friends - break out of the Yeatsian straitjacket and employ the rhythms of common speech to good effect. Speaking of George Barker, for instance, hle manages to say something true both of that ""oddly, informally grand"" writer, and of him-self, the comment on lhimself being characteristically throwaway, muttered, but startling:
Men envy and fear the know-how Of the Fates they have riot had:
But I thiznk of your life with love now.
(It was 1, not you, went mad ...
The tone of this reminds me of Fraser's arresting remark in a note at the back of his late collection Essays on TwentiethCentury Poets (1977) where, criticizing his own work of 30 years before, he commented: ""I wrote this as an agnostic of deeply religious sentiments. I write now as an Anglican with few religious sentiments: I need the sacraments but hate the sermons and the false goodfellowship. In 1947, 1 was better and wiser."" Few contemporary poets, I suggest, have been less romantic about their own illusions.
jolhLn Wain's Poems 1949-1979 (Macmillan, £9.95) is rigorously selective, but contains enough of this writer's sharp early verse to be worth purchasing if you are not already in possession of A W^lord Carved on a Sill (1956). That hook tcok its title from some lines by !Robert Graves, and the new one begins with a longish poem entitled ""Visitin- an Old Poet"" which is also plainly about Graves although it does not name him. Graves is Wain's mentor and his touchstone. The most vigorous bit in the new poem celebrates the tinme when Graves was
young ant stubbom and full of sap and running over with poetry, when he was savage
sarcastic and funny, when he cut r-ough capers...
It is difficult to avoid the feeling that Wain here is writing what amounts to an elegy for his own lost sap. He has certainly never surpassed his own ""rough capers"", although they were not (in retrospect) especially rough, for was he not one of those original bald men fighting for tho cc,n,h) .~ _ _

Jubilee Gala
Coliseum
The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh went to the London Coliseum last night to attend an operatic gala commemorating the golden jubilee of the company at first known as Sadler's Wells Opera, now as English National Opera.
Brilliant fanfares from Beniamin Britten's coronation opera Gloriana, greeted the royal party on arrival. They entered the royal box to mnore fanfares, and then Britten's moving version of the National Anthem, sung in front of the front dropcurtain by the asembled opera company. After the final curtain-fall, the Queen was to be presented, on stage, with bound volumes on the history of the company and its present London home.
The gala performance itself was unusually enjoyable, as such events go, avoiding the choppy, unoperatic night of as many star singers as can be crammed, optimistically, into too little time but concentrating instead on whole scenes from four favourite operas that have long been connected with the Sadler's Wells/English National Opera.
Most interesting, perhaps was the Pub Scene, introduced by the Storm interlude from Peter Grimes. Its first performance in June 1945 was the most important the company ever gave. Gnimes is not at present in ENO repertory, but is due to return in something like the vigorous, attentive (admittedly sketetal) staging seen here, the
music spouted, hurricanefashion, under Sir Charles Mackerras's ebullient direction.
Alberto Remedios made a moment of almost screne poetry in ""Now the Great Bear."" Anne Collins as a lively Auntie, Norman Bailey's bluff Balstrode, the fzrmly projected Boles of Donald Pulley (welcome back), and Shelagh, Squires pent, forbidding Mrs Sedley, all promised something exceptional for the forthcoming new cast.
The third act of Puccini's La Boheme, the most sheerly exquisite, craftsmanly flawless, emotionally overwhelming, known to me in any operatic repertory, had to have a place. It offered us no snow, an inn covered in scaffolding and tarpaulin, and Mini uncloaked for a bitter winter's dawn - bad omens: but here were Josephine Barstow, an irresistible Mimi, and John Treleaven's romantic Rudolph (when they sing in English, it is mad to translate their French names into Italian).
From the Wells's marvellous Verdi repertory we had the study scene from Don Carlos, a parade of noble singing and fervent playing under Mark Elder, Linda Esther Gray, Richard Van Allan, and John Tomlinson preeminent. As finale there was a clever digest of the ball scene from Johann Strauss's Die Fledermaus, with ballet, the Champagne song, ""Duidu"" nicely led by Alan Opie, the prancing of Eric Shilling, the debonair playboy of Emile Belcourt, and Strauss's music dancing, for once in immaculate style, under Mackerras. You can see it all tonight on BBC television.

"Wain, John",Over a thousand years,The Times,1981-May-07,"London, England","Over a thousand years
-It was not until, to quote the first line of an excellent poem by Yeats, ""My fiftieth year had come and gone"" that I was offered the chance to make a really substantial selection from the whole range of English poetry. Of course I accepted at * once. I have always believed ih
the usefulness of criticism (pr'ovided, of' course, that criticism is kept in its right place, as an ancillary, activity), and: I knew how important the major 'anthologies had been in' influenci.ng taste. With thlat part of me that is a critic, I welcomed'. the opportunity to produce a book that might help people to see English poetry in itsu f splendour.
I thought back to Palgrave in the 1860s. A;n admirer of Teniyson, 'he, consulted the Laureate during the preparation of the Golden Treasury, that -phenomenally successful an.
thology. which more or less moulded English taste in poetry in his day. Those poems that came closest to the limpid, choicely cadenced sometimes rather viscous, lyricism of Tennyson were what Palgrave liked best, and they became what many English readers liked best.
Palgrave's full title was Thze Golden Treasury of English Songs and Lyrics, so that he did at least nod towards the large body of satirical, meditative, narrative and dramatic verse in English that he was leaving
aside. But his very skilful selection was so popular and had so much influence that by th2 time Quiller-Couch came to edit The Oxford Book of English Verse in 1900 he had no qualms about presenting very much the same kind of selection with a much more take-or-leave-it title: -the tradition of English verse is here.
.I- am not advancing a conspiracy, theory; both these worthy men saw themselves as offering, for the delectation and benefit of the reader, a nosegay of the kind. of poetry they themselves liked. Certainly they meant no harm. But they were rather like: theatre directors usir.V various .tricks. of lighting and grouping to get the audience to. look at one restricted part .of the stage when in fact, an enormous panoramic spectacle was in progress. Obviously the balance has -been redressed since, and poets whopn Palgrave and Quiller-Couch under-represented, such as Dryden and Blake, have been offered to the public in many a tasteful package. Yet those two anthologies, for all their faults, were welcomed by the English reading public and given an honoured position. Households that contained no other books of verse had those two on their shelves. And, while I naturally hesitate to speak for anyone else, I would guess that the core ambition of -every anthologist
since their day - every one, that is, who has attempted not a period or specialized anthology but a broad canvas - has been to produce a book that would have the centrality, and win the acceptance, that Palgrave and Quiller-Couch did, while doing more justice to the scope and variety of English poetry.
In other words, to have range, breadth, a large freedom of choice as between one idiom and another, and yet still be able to say to the reader: ""This is English poetry"". To cater for many tastes and many moods without ending up with a ragbag of unrelated items that give the reader, ultimately, the impression that the field is too wide to be presented within a single book.
That has been my aim in Everyman's Book of English Verse. Range, contrast, spectrum. If there is a kind of poetry that has been written successfully by an English poet and it is not in the book, then to that extent I have failed.
Of course this has meant departing from standard anthological practice. Most anthologies begin at the point where the language becomes unmistakably ""modern"" - effectively, the sixteenth century. I felt I could not tell the story of English poetry without including the Anglo-Saxon achievement. Of course this has. meant translation, since a
modern person cannot inderstana Anglo-Saxon without study; and where I could not find translations that cotipletely satisfied me I have had to do them myself, or commission new ones; but modernizing Anglo-Saxon does not seem to me quite the sa-me thing as translating the wvork of a French or Italian poet. This is our language, in its pre-Norman form; these are our rhythms; and certainly these are our subjects and preoccupations.
This decision gives the book a range of a thousand years (the youngest poet represented is, at a guess, some 25 years my junior) and I do not suppose I have been equally successful in representing every style and every period. But I have, for this task, one temperamental advantage. My taste in literature is conventional. (Hostile critics may substitute the word ""commonplace"".) If a poet has been admired by a good many generations of English readers, the chances are that I shall admire him too. I have never been influenced by the notion that to build up one poet it is necessary to undermine another. I happen to like the poetry of Milton, but if I did not, it would not occur to me to spend years, as F. R. Leavis did, trying to stop other people liking him on the grounds that this would make them less receptive to opposite qualities in, say, Shakespeare. I do not
believe one's literary taste works like that. I
Personally' I enjoy most-of the well-known things in' nglish poetry.' I like the bold;
confident stride of Dryden and the delicate lyricism of Cam' pion.- I'like the diamond-polish of Pope and the unplaned roughness of Kit Smart. I- amn moved by the creamy, Virgilian melancholy of Gray and' the sharp anguish of Hopkins.
I have also departed frnm practice in including, extracts from long poems. I admit that bleeding chunk s are not 'a pretty sight, yet it seems to xrae possible to be too. seagreen in.corruptible about this. -All readers of poetry do in fact revisit their favourite passages in long poems or speeches from plays; if this is permissible (and I am waiting for someone toaeill me that it isn't), then it ought t6 be permissible to put stich things into an anthology. I
Most of the poems in the book I have: known for many years, and they have weathered well. But of course I did some fresh reading for the occasion; and there are fifty or sixty here that were new to me. I thiuk, though, that I have learnt to recognize durability when I. se,e it.

John Ashbery is the Salvador Dali of contemporary verse in English - by which I mean that he is a master draughtsman who has degigns on his audience to convince us that he is really a genius. Like Dali, he has no one recognizable or characteristic manner. His work is an anthology of styles. He writes poems in which nothing is certain, and meaning is consistently withheld. Some of his earlier books (I'm thinking particularly of The Tennis Court Oath, published in 1962) consist of verse of such remorseless obscurity that there was even an anecdote current that he wrote it by selecting the seventh line down on the seventh page of every seventh book in his library. If not true, then it still teils a trtith. Ashbery is mahy -voices in one man. He's a joker, a trickster, a clown. -What is. remarkable about him is that, having said this, I still have to say that -the poems in, his As' We Know (Carcanet New Press, '£4:95) have a quality of pure mesmerism.- The- long - ""Litany"" egpecially, written in double .columns, for two voices which we -are meant to hear or overhear simultaneously but independently, is. a stunning achievement. I cOnnot understand! it, - and after several readings :1 am' convinced that being understood is no part of Ashbery's purpose, yet it has a power' of - verbal fascination swhioh keeps drawing the reader back. - Instrutnental in - this process are of course the brief individual passages which can imrnmdiately be understood:
But poetry is making things in the
past; The past transcends and excuses
thesc Grimy arguments which fog over as You begin to contemplate them.
Poetry Has atready happened. And the
agony Of looking steadily at something isn't Really there at all, it's something you Once read about; its narrative thrust Carties it far beyond what it thought
it was All het up about; its charn, no longer A diversionary tactic, is something
Grace, in the long run, which is what
poetry is. What it comies down to is this, perhaps: that Ashbery's work intrigues because it concen-
trates a playfully profound imagination upon the whole problem of meaning and identity, and comes up with no answers, only alternative quastons in the form of verse which in a sense replaces the joys and anxieties which inspired it. He always seems deternmined to puzzle out some mo e-than-personal truth from all rhe accents and accidents of its saying, with a result that while he has no single ""voice"" he often rises to an unquestionable authority of tone. He will baffle you. But he will haunt you. It's worth working through the bafflement to the ghost, in my opinion. To return to my original figure: while Ashbery, like Dali, can turn out work which seems merely jewelled and meretricious, his is nevertheless a real and disturbing talent. In the corner of the most stagey Dali picture, you will often find a well-drawn boat or wristwatch. In the corner of Ashbery's most rhetorical and evasive poems, you will often find lines as memorable and truthful as any going.
Edward Thomas, at his best, consists of nothing else but such corners. In a sense he vlas helped here by the fact that he did not start writing poems until he Was 36, and by the accident of his death in the first stages of the Battle of Arras some three years later. If the writing of poetry may be compared to walking, we might say that. a. poet who begins young (and Thomas is the only major poet I can think of who did not) learns to run before he can walk, learns how to deal with the ""big"" moments before he can find meaning in the ""small"" things of maybe more profound significance, and when he is not running the young poet nmay waste his time trying to imitate other walkers or setting out deliberately to develop an original walk of his own, the deliberateness being in this case absurd. Thomas avoided such antics. Knowing, as it were, plenty about the proper disposition of his arms and legs before he came to poetry, this poet hit his stride immediately. Here is the conclusion of what the new paperback edition of The Collected Poems of Edward Thomas (Oxford, £2.95) shows to have been only the fourth poem he wrote in his life:
I have ,nistdid the key. I sniff the
spray
And think of nothing; I see and I hear nothing,
Yer seem, too, to be listening, lying in wait
For what I should, yet never can, remember:
N'o gatdet2 appears, no path, no hoer. green bush
Of Led's-love, or Old Matt, no child beside,
Neither fdther nor mothet, nor dny plainate;
Otily an avenue, dark, nameless, without enVl.
That will prevail, I think, when higher pitched voices have worn themselves out. Thomas 'wrote only 144 poems in that astonishing burst of energy which was his very brief life as a poet. Of that number, about two dozen are of the first water. He was not a war noet. His work - as Martin Seymour-Smith once pointed out - is ultimately nearer to Rilke than to Robert
Frost. Seymour-Smith defines I his subject-matter as ""not nature - though he evokes nature finely - but the menacing and tormenting web of eroticism, beauty (as he felt in nature) and solipsist experience"". I thitik thiS is worth repeating because it is true, and because EtIward Thomas is so often miisunderstood and underestimated because faintly prailsed for the wrong reasons. The new -xford paperback contains l'sb his private diary kept during, his last three months as a soldier.
Hahs Magnus Enzensberger's The Sinking- of the Titranic (Ctrcanet New Press, £3.95) is interesting. The poet takes wn historical event and pursues it through 33 cantos and a munber of interspersed pieces which ex-arlibe; and attack his own inotives and methods. I found the nervous self-questionirig miore moving than the narrative sections, though the latter aie certainlg impressive in their variety, moving from tihe lyric to the satirical with much ease and authority. The translation from the German has been done by Enzensberger himself.
Finally, I would like to recommend Herbert Lomas's collection entitled Public Foot. path (Anvil Prets, £3.25) for its sequence ""Todmorden"". about the Pennines where he was born and spent his childhood; Libby Houston's At thze Mercy (Allison & Busby, £4.95, £2.75) for its very moving title poem in memory of her husband, the artist Mal Dean, who died of cancer in 1974 at the age of 33; and Peter Porter's Engitsh Subtitles (Oxford, £3.50) for its excursions and discursions in manv forms and directions.

Church Poems
By John Betjeman Illustrated by John Piper
(John Murray, fS.95)
""Church of England Thoughts"", one of A Few Late Chrysanthemums (1954), collected now in Church Poems, contains a stanza which as well as describing Magdalen Tower's chiming bells, might just as well describe Betieman's poetry:
A Church of England sound, it
tells
Of ""moderate"" worship. God and
State, WVhere matins congregations go Conservative and good and slow
To elevatiors of the plate.
Church Poems are for the faithful. Some concern church architecture, furnishings, and a great deal of bell-ringing. Many are embellished by John PiDer's charming and elegant line drawings. Some dwell, in passing, on death and resurrection. Others, such as ""Autumn 1964"", show Betjeman as celebrant of God's creation in days before the ravages of the Other Power's Dutch Elm Disease ineradicably altered English landscape:
The yellowing elm shows yet some
g,reen,
The melTowing bells exultant
sound, Never have light and colour been
So prodigally thrown around.
And in another, amid the duckweed of Letcombe Brook. he loDks with gentle eye on ""a mud gray-' trout which ""hovers and darts away at my approach"". Heaney's tough, military trout is totally alien:
A volley of cold blood
Ramrodding the current
Some of the poems are old: the new ones were composed while Sir John and John Piper wandered the land composing the Shell Guides. As he writes in his introduction, ""Both of us were none too solemn"". There is always a hint of puckishness surviving in Betieman's verse. In ""Our Padre"" from Continual Dew (1937), a mischievous, satirical voice is in command:
Our padre is an old sky pilot,
He's tied a reef knot round my
heart
and the chorus is about pulling ""for the shore, sailor"" with the padre rowing stroke. At the same time, the poem makes moral comments on human nature in general, and on the present condition of Church of England parishes in particular. As Sir John says, churches are not just ""architectural style and rateable values"": they are human institutions, vicars, vergers, parish mags, congregations.
He never allows his poetry to escape the real world, and. this no doubt is one important reason why he remains so popular. There is even a hint of the utter mundaneness of Pbilip faldn about his verse. In ""On Leaving Wantage, 1972"", bellrngers are described making for the church tower,
From rumpled beds on far-off new
estates,
Fwm houses over shops along ithe
Fum rad-hrick villas somewhat
fiurTher out.
But how much more optimistic
is all this and the sound of, Betiernn's carillons to Larkdn's ""cut-price crowd"" down from ""the raw estates"" to spend on
consumer durables. The warm spirituality of the C of E, as interpreted by Sir John, fills that awful vacancy, that empty blueness, seen through ""high windows"" by his heir-apparent.
""Septuagesima"" more than any of the poems is a song of. praise for the Church of
England at the core of this. collection. Betjeman notes that. Septuagesima is
A somewhat unattractive time
Which hardly len-as itself to rhyme.
But still it gives the chance to me To praise our dear old C. of E.
Not only is the Church's embracing doctrine praised but the ordinary work of the parish, whether done by the cleaner of the aisles or the ""Treasurer of the P.C.C."", is given its due significance.
Poets laureate have always been the prey of satirist and parodist; Colley Cibber fell victim to Pope, and Masefield too was ridiculed. Betjeman is not unscathed; but his parodists usually miss his characteristics of humanity and homeliness. Anthony Burgess's nasty satire in Earthlp Powers is wide of the mark: Dawson Wignall ""not yet O.M. but tinkling with other awards"" eludes his original. Joriathan Price in ""Sir John Revisits Jericho"" (1978) gets closest to him, -parodying his ballad style and making Sir-. John and his ""St Barnabas, Oxford"" the content of the poem.
Church Poems ends with what might be called, in these Erastian, economically stringent times, a C of E ""recessional"", ""Blame the Vicar"", a cautionary tale. A carping congregation will drive away the vicar and find ""The living's been amalgamated"". All these poems show Sir John's warm-hearted enthusiasm for the unobtrusive parish churches and a caring affection for their congregations.

And did his teachers really inflict the Golden Treasury on him ""because they were paid to and because the syllabus demanded it""? Well, Academe's loss is England's gain. The effect of all those ""heavy and dusty"" poems was to inspire the witty disenchantment of his verses ""in the glassroom"" and elsewhere. Now he has brought along some friends to augment his subversive lyric voice.
To begin with it is funny and astringent. Such a change to have home-truths served up without any fancy garnish: you fit into me

Robert Frost once actually defined poetry as ""wihat gets lost in translation-"" There is some truth in that, for a good poem invariably happens some-where close to the roots of any given language. The better the poem, the harder to translate or transplant it? Hearts are easier.
To say that a thing is impossible, though, is not to say that it should not be tried. The poems of Paul Celan present very great problems for the translator, especially his highly idiosyncratic final poems before his suicide in 1970. MNichael Hambutger rises brilliantly to the occasion in his selection Paul Celan: Poems (Carcanet, £7.95), a bilingual edition spanning the poet's whole career- Hamburger admits at the outset that Celan's work ""confronts us wiith difficulty and paraiox"" from wvhichever direction we approach it. Hermetic, desperate, precise, characterized by what Hamburger well-defines as ""their peculiar leaps and bounds, their haltingness and their silences "", Celan's poems at their best transcend personal anguish and comnunicate a truth common to us all:
Black milk of daybreak we drink
3ou at 22ight
we drink pou at noon death is a
master for Genmany
we drink you at sundown and in
the morning we drink
and we drink you
death is a master from Germany
his eyes are blue.
he strikes Dou Zwi Zeaden 7ulZels
his aim is true
a man lives in the house your
golden hzair Margarete
he sets his pack on to us he grants
us a grave in the air
he plays with the serpents and
daydreams death is a master fronz Germany your golden hair Margarete your ashen hair ShuZmrnith
Celan w7as Jewish and botth his parents were murdered in a concentration camp. He came to refuse permnission for anthologists to use the poem whose final stanza I have quoted above, "" Todesfuge "" ("" Death Fugue""), because he felt its imagery was too direct, too explicit, and because the was cut to the quick by the critical accusation that he had made something ""beautiful"" out of events too ferrible for wordsthe poem is of course about. Auschwitz. Celan aspired to a pure poetry, an absolute poetry, yet at the same time his work is rich and dark with religious and political self-questioning. Speaking about poetry, he once quoted this definition by MIalebranche: ""Attention is the natural prayer of the souL"" Hamburger refers to this and quite properly ad's that he neither knowvs nor considers it his business to know -what Celan believed. ""It is this quality of attention in his poems that points to a religious sensibility.
I might add that this marvellous volumre is a real eyeopener to those who previously knewv Celan only by repute, or through one or ntwo pieces in anthologies. Here is a major poet-and since Hamburger has been prudent and selective especiallv in the area of those poems which cannot be reproduced in English because they attaclk the German language itself by punning having to do with Celan's "" anomalous position as a poet born in a German-speaking enclave that had been destroyed by the Germans"", because of this,. I suggest, not all the poetry ihas been lost in the translation.
I suspect that Seanmus eteaney .v-od- tr.anslate smoothly JAW o foreign
language. Not6b6cduse his verseis thin and obvious but because it has a surface richness 'whicIi could be made to work in (say) French or German by any skilled rhetorician. His Selected Poerns 1965-1975 (Faber £3.95, paperback £1.95) is a most enjoyable book, full of immediately Miceable things, but for me it confirms the suspicion I have felt with each of his individual collections-that here is a poet of indubitable talent who has settled for writing what Gerard Manley Hopkins called ""Parnassian "" verse, as opposed to poetry proper, the language of inspiration. Parnassian, says Hopkins,. can be written only
by real ,poets, but it is not in' the highest sense poetry, being "" sp.oken on and from the level of a poets mind, not, as in the other case, when the inspiration, w,hich is the gift of genius, raises him above himself.' Parnassian, in other w~ords, is what a poet writes when he tries to write a poem. WNell, Heaney only rarely seems to be doing anything else, to my imind, and the occasions vwhen he lets the poem speak for itself are too infrequent to justify the high praise wvhich some critics have heaped upon him.
All I know is a door into the
dark.
Outside, o14 axles and iron
hoops rusting,;
Inside, the hammered anvil's
short-pitched ring,
The unpredictable fantcal of
sparks
Or hiss when a new shoe
toughens in water . . .
That is Heaney at his best: a good describer. It is because he can describe so wivell that I want more of him. More truth, more meaning, more altogether of "" the roll, the rise, the carol, the creation "". He has a great grip of his craft. He has only to learn that most difficult thin.g: how to express 'what his craft is at present concealing.
Bread for the Winter Birds .(Hutchinson, f6.95) collects the -last poems 'written by Thomas Blackburn, -who, died in 1977. If none of them has the power or, the memorability of earlier poems such as ""A Small Keen WVimd`""-the best thing he ever wrote, in my - opinion-the verses presented here are still remarkable for their honesty and their plainness.
It is only now in my. sixth decade
that, instead of
Trying to live life, I let life live
me;
W'Vhy it should do so and so be-
latedly ?
I'm not sure though it has some-
thing to do with love. . . .
The lines stagger on the edge uf the banal, but when-one coxisiders Blackburn's career as .a whole they become impressil'e for their modest simplicity. 4
Anthony Thvaite's Victorian Voices (Oxford, £3.95 paper,back) is an interesting and in-. ventive attempt to do some-
thing new wrvith the form of-, monologue developed by Browning in "" Men and Women "". Thwaite's 14 voices are all those of not particularly eminent Victorians. I found the poem supposed to be spok-en by Hardy's friend Thomas Moule (who killed himself) especially moving:
Dear brother in the outer room, A kind of trickling, a sound you
cannot place:
That cold commemorator I
encouraged
Will Place it, uise it, all ,gr.St for

I took the open razor to mny

Selected Prose
By Gerard MIailey lHopkins
Edited by Gerald Roberts (Oxford, 9Sp)
A friend of mine at Oxford had a lowv opinion of one of the lecturers in English literature. He invented for him a spoof list of for2hcoming lectures, which included ""Shakespeare the novelist"" and ` George Eliot the man"".
""Gerard Manley Hopkins the prose wvriter"" sounds almost as absurd. For all his vaunted aim of writing verse in the rhythms of everyday speech, Hopkins remains poetic. True, he drained poetry of its stagnant poetic conventions, eliminated "" o'ers "" and ""e'en's"" and replaced the plaved-out Italianate "" beauteous "" wvith the Anglo-Saxon ""` lovely ""` He also mocked what he called- the "" trioleteers "" the triflers in verse. (Andreiv Lang, the chief offender, was his exact contemporary at Balliol.) But Hopkins merely substituted one kind of mannerism for another. It is gloriously effective, in poems such as The Wreck of the Deutschl and and The Windhover: but it can hardly be said to approach the colloquial. Even when he needed to command everyday speech, in his sermons to ordinarv folk, Hopkins used such passionate and improbable metaphors that his congregation, to his chagrin, burst into laughter.
One might expect his prose to be mannered, full of voluptuous imagery-an expression of the temperament to which rich vestments, ritual, incense, dinging bells and golden monstrances appealed. We find just those qualities in the prose of another nineteenth - centurv Roman Catholic poet, Francis Thompson, wvho wvrote of Shelley:
The universe is his box of tops. He dabbles his fingers in the do-ffall. He is goZd-dzislu tVith twnbling amidst the stars. He makes bright mischief 7ith the
moon. Thc meteors nuzzle their noses in hzs hand. He teases into growtling the kennellcd thunder and laughs at zhe shaking of its ficri- chlain. Hc dances in and out of the gates of heaven: its floor is lirrered with his broken jancies. He runs wild over the fields of ether. He chases the rolling world.
Hopkins never indulged in that kind of ritualistic prose. His child-like outlook was against it: and the greatest prose influence of and on his whole life was Newman's Apologia (1864), which inspired his reception into the Roman Catholic church (by Newman himself) in 1866. Like the best conjuring tricks. the Apologia achieves the maximum of mystification wvith the simplest of means, the most disarming professions of nothing-up-mysleeve. Infatuated with the message of the book, Hopkins 'was equally a convert to its pellucid style-though perhaps unwittingly, as he made severe criticisms of Newman's prose in a letter to Coventry Patmore.
How un-mandarin and unpurple-passagey his own prose is. The verv first line of this selection (fromn a letter of 1862) contains a second sentence only two words long. Some passages have a dynamic quaintness that could belong to no other author. Who else could have written (of Goethe and Burns) : "" Thev spoke out the real human rakishness of their hearts and everybody recognized the really beating. though rascal, vein ""? And sometimes we find in the prose the germ of a future poetic effect, as when he writes, in a Meditation on Hell: ""You have seen a glassblower breathe on a flame; at once it darts out into a jet taper as a lance-head and as piercing too ""-an obvious anticipation of the phrase "" live and lancing like the blowpipe flame"" in the poem dedicated to Robert Bridges written in 1889, the year of Hopkins's death. At the same time, it is surprising to learn (from a letter to his brother Everard) that Hopkins thought
prose, ""though commonly less beautiful than verse and debarred from its sympathetic beauties, has, at least possible to it, effects more beautiful than any verse can attain "". Here speaks the defer-der of pied beauty and wildernesses, of language untrammelled by metre or rhyme.
Gerald Roberts's selection is judicious, and, set chronologically as it is, forms a kind of informal autobiography of Hopkins. Only a few passages do not seem to earn their placer. The recurririg glories are the natural descriptions, so remiriscent of Leonardo's in their obsessional detail and the quest for what Hopkins called ""inscape "", the form - giving essence of things; and the literary criticisms which Hopkins svapped with Bridges, Patmore, Canon Dixon and other friends Often nervy and diffident in his dealings *vith men. Hopkins was serenelv confident not to say dogmatic-in his literary judgments. R. L. Stevenson has effects "" worthy of Shakespeare "". The genius of Blackmore's and Hardy's novels is ""not much inferior to what made the Elizabethan drama "". On the freethinking George Eliot ("" this Evans-Eliot-- Lewis-Cross, woman "") a more stunmary judgment is passed: "" overdone reputation . . . half real power, half imposition."" The priest tugs at the critic's armr.
Compliments to the art director of OUP on the most perfect cover design that could have been chosen: a painting of bluebells by H. Larpent Roberts. It illustrates one of the most lyrical natural descriptions in the book. It is a pity Gerald Roberts omits the fervent Blakean lines from the Diary of Mav 1870 which begin: ""I do not think I have ever seen anvthing more beautiful than the bluebell 1 have been looking at. I know the beauty of our Lord by it.""

Selected Lyrics and Satires. of John Wilmot. Second Earl of Rochester, edited and introduced bv Ronald Duncan (Rebel Press, £3.95)
Because of his scandalous reputation, Rochester has always been good for publishers'
balance-sheets. The first collection of poems attributed to him came out within months of his death, three hundred years ago this year. It was pirated, and nearly half of its contents were actually by other poetsEdmund Ashton, Aphra Behn, Charles Buckhurst (Earl 6f Dorset), George Etherege, Charles Sedley and others.
Similar rip-offs followed, and the republication by The Rebel Press of Ronald Duncan's selection, first brought out in 1948 and completely unrevised, belongs to this tradition. It contains no new material-least of all any acknowledgement that it has been outdated. Duncan's pretentious and slapdash introduction tells us for example (and his publisher's advertisements imply) that the poems are out of print. This was true in 1948 but is far from being so now. In order of appearance since theft, and still available in paperback, and all either cheaper than, or the same price as the Duncan edition, there aPre Vivian de Sola Pinto's Muses' Library
edition, £2.75-a very useful text though missing two poems, one of which Duncan prints; David M. Vieth's edition of the Complete Poems (Yale, £3.95), a rigorous scholarly edition based on the most substantial research yet done on the texts; and John Adlard's The Debt to Pleasure (Carcanet, £1.95), an attractive, full and-for the general reader-adequately reliable selection from all Rochester's writings. And if, like Duncan, you are really more interested in ""Rochesteriana"" than in the works of Rochester, you can get secondhand a cheap facsimile reprint of the 1680 Poems on Several Occasions, published by the Scolar Press. Many of the poets included in it-and in Duncan's selection-as ""Rochester"" are now available in separate scholarly editions, particularly Etherege and Buckhurst.
Of Duncan's book the best that can be said is that a fair number of Rochester's best poems are in it, even though the last stanzas of "" Love a woman ? You're an ass "", "" Vulcan, contrive me such a
cup "" and ""Fair Chloris in a pigsty lay "" are missing. But mosl readers wifI not know whether these are among the genuine items or not without consulting other books. Of the sixty or so poems included, in fact, twenty-five are almost certainly not Rochester's, and the authors of many of them are known: four by Edward Radclyffe, for example, two by Buckhurst and one each by Thomas D'Urfey Sir Carr Scroop, Charles Blount John Sheffield (Earl of Muigrave). John Freke, Edmund Ashton, and Rochester's wife Elizabeth. Ronald Duncan tells us that Rochester "" is a poet in his own right"". This is quite true. What this selection unwittingly demonstrates is that a fair number of his contemporaries were poets in their own right, too.

P: ey . p t :
Consider the .case: of. Gavin wExat. lHe begin With. a. barig, in 1933, wvhen at the age of 17 he contributed a sirie.s of epi. grammatic- poe ms. entitled "" Phallus in Wonderland "" to Geoffrey Grigson's'`New; Verse. In 1939 she pubblished a book 'from Fortune Press','."" .Poems -and SGongs "". Then,"" until the mid-sixties, silence. Or, rather, nothing 'much written or' published, and only 'that quatrain about Miss Twye t6 represent him in the anthologies:
Miss. Twpe was saapiizg her breasts
in her bath Whzen she heard behind her a
- meaning lauigh And to her amazement she
discovered
A wicked man in the bathrobm
cupboard.
In the past 15 years or so, as The Collected Ewart 1933-1980 (Hutchinson, £10) demonstrates, thdis poet has been getting it all together again in no .uncertain fashiort- I think that's the first time I've ever used 'that fashionable' itemii of slang in a review, and I use it now because it suits Ewart down to the ground. I-e belongs to Show Biz before he bel3ngs to Literatur6. Witty, clever, coarse, lie needed the Sixties and Seventies, with their in most '-ways ghastly blurring of those categories, to allow him his own late flower. irig or prickling as a pbet.
And I'm not knocking E.wart. Light verse is an art, like any other, with few masters. He is in my view the finest living expo.nent of a particular kind of light verse, frivolous, erotic, ironic,x invariably entertaining and never pretentious. The bangers he lets off now are better than the ""Phallus in Wonderland"" stuff, and there is no . o,ne who sounds a less shrill nDte in the difficult business of laughing at himself. Witness the end of his ""2001: The Tennyson/Hardy Poem"", where he celebrates a future in which he will have outlived all his. contem. poraries:
Sootl comes the day when the
stream runs dry
And the boat runs back as the tide
is turning,
The voice' once strong no more
thzan a sigih
By the hearth where the fire is
scarcely burning.
Stiff in my chair like a children's
guy,
Simply because I have no seniors The literati will raise the cry Ewart's a genius !
I thinik it was Berryman who once remarked that when Shakespeare said he had two loves of comfort and despair he wasn't kidding. It is that element of not kidding, even when he is kiddding, that I like in Gavin ERvart. In other words, he is a miloiun miles a.way from your slim books of verse that say only ""Look, I have travefleld "" or ""Look, I have been looking at paintings "" or "" Look, I have thoughts and/or a sensibility unlike anything ever thought or felt before "". There is a lot of raw, ordinary, everday stuff held in place in Ewart's wellturned stanzas, and the unmistakble tone of a man who is trying hard to say what he means, or mean what he says,
if 'you b'elieve in inspr,ation;
I ami sure 'Sebastian Barker does. Believe in inspiration, that is. He is the sen of George !Barker. and ElizabethSmart- and his first book, On the Rocks, -a :couple of years 'ago, established him inim4n'
diately as, someone prepared to rush headlong in words at his' own experience, as you might have expected with such, a. parentage. It also revealed, .beyond its necessary inmmaturities, a considerable if funlbflng power. I can not recall a ytoung poet vith so much blood in him appearing on the scene for quite a ivhiile; Barker's second book Epistles. (Martini Brian & O'Keefie, '£3) 'is. a s'nhade disappointing,: not just because its deployrneht' cf a variety of. epistolary 'fornis representg sotne slackening of tension (the first .'book haminered away- at themes ef love 'and betrayal in a.sonnet sieries which. just'.about kept young Barker's mind on the rails .,rhile' al-loving his. heart. to visit thie rocks). but because too many 'of the' persons addressed in these episties are poets. .
Fro.m Dom Moraes'.to- Alexande;r SA;zhenitsyn. Barker is caught in the act of conistructing, some kind of personal poe. tic pantheon. The fact that he is less than reverential before h,is gods i:s 'neithef here nor there. The truth is that when a poet. writes about other poets hea is too often thinking about himself. I 'happen. to believe Sebastian Barker did more with words vhen he was loving 'and . biating his wife or his mistress or 'whoaever she was than when he is loving and hating ' himself 'in the shape of his older brothers and father in the craft of verse. Still and all, the book is the real thing, and worth anyone's acquisition, and in the two final poems, ""The Walled Garden "", it moves away from literary hero-worship and incidentally reveals a mastery of the long line packed with close observation of the natural world, as well as people in that landscape, which augurs nicely for Barker's future. He. has only his solipsism to lose.
Geoffrey Grigson's . History of Him (Secker & Warburg, £4.50) is best where it is angriest, and Grigson is as anigry as ever at the prospect of the world's Calvin Bedients and phoney poe,ts of all kinds:
Books of poems l!;ing around are

lators
Fronz language depts. of .unversi-t
ties
Paper-backed (I mean the books,
though
The translator and the poets prob-
ably
Could be spoken of as paper;
backed) ...
Dick Davis' has been highly praised by -Thom Gunn and others, and the j;icket 'of his Seeing the World (Anvil-Press, £2.75) refers to him calmly as
thre most gifted of the younger generation of- English poets "". I cannot agree with this judgnent. Davis seems to me like those South African novelists attacked by Roy Campbell-all 'snaffle, curb, and firm restraint; no bloody horse. If ainything, this minuscule poet is more tongue-tied
than reticent, and possibly even the impression of the tied tongue derives from his having precious little to say in; the first place.
Ronald Bottrall is an undervaltued poet. He never quite resurfaced after being patted heavily on the head by Dr Leavis in the Thirties, but his Ref. lections on the Nile (London Magazine Editions, F3.50) is full of all sorts of ver1.al and metrical skills applied to matters which -the poet has be6
moved - by.-'These. -are 'rocca-t sional ': bheiS, but, occasibnal in the etter sense. One, is made to> know that there was an occasion, and-that the poet
exp6nienced it. The verse does' not always rise to the mystery of the occasion, but even- Bot. trall's failures are hsnourable.
Finally, ah curiosity. Ernest Hemingway: 88 Poems; edited by Nicholas Gerogiannis, brings together every scrap of pa-per or piec- of torn card-
hoard (and lavatory wall?) on which Hemingway ever scribbled or-scraped somethin,g that rhymed (vaguely) or went dow.n the page in even -shorzer sentences:than his prose-.

""One is always nearer by not keeping still."" Thom Gunn's famous last line from his poem "" On the Move "" will serve well enough as epigraph for a: quick riun through the best of last year's verse. I
Gunn himself issued a Sclected Poems CFdbet, £4.50 aad £1.95), a judiciously chosehi anthology, drawing on all his full4ength books. No poet of his generation began more brillianidy:
I thought I was so tough,
But gentled at your hands. Canmot be quick enoughi To fly for you and show That when I go I go At Vour commands.
The relationship between the bird and its master, worked out through four stanzas, with neat puns on the usages of hawking was typical of early Gunn, providing him with just tHle sort of exercise in intensity which his sophistication at that time appeared to require. The subject matter of his verse was love and the importance (even occasionally the deification) of action. The poems were muscular and dramatic, sometimes over-contrived, but usually satisfying in the way they worked through conceits to a punch-line not necessarily conceited, as at the end of ""The Beach Head "", a fine poem
about a love affair conceived in terms of military metaphor:
Or shall * wait and calculate my
chances
Consolidating this mv inch-square
base,
-Myself a spy, killing your spies-
in-glances-
Planning when you have least
supplies or clot72ing
A* pincer move to end 'in atZ
embrace,
And risk that your mild liking
,turn to loathing ?
The later poems, which experini6nt with syllabics, show7 an in6rease in directness and some si&kening of wit I would argue that he has never surpassed the achievement of his two early collections. Perhaps tb!is is only a way of saying that aill Gunn!s work is a young man's work, and he was 50- this year. The Selected Poems is a volume wlich anyone who cares about modern English poetry will want to hayve.
Ted Hughes has also published a book this yearMoortown (Faber, £5.25 and £1.95). The verse journal which opens this collection seems to me the most agreeable thing that Hughes has written for a long time. In it, he concentrates his powerful verbal gift on sights and sounds culled from his experience of farming iln the Devon countryside. The result is at best finely spontaneous, -as you would expect fromn Hughes, but also modest and aontrolled, adjectives which no critic in his right nind would dream of applying to- this poet's most famous (and I think overvalued) book Crow. The violence and gentleness of the natural world-aand. the opportunity which it 9ffers the human imagination for empathy-has always brought out the best in Hughes, and I admire the freshness of these poems, their close observation, and alert patience: Blue haze. Bees uanging in air at
the hive-mouth.
CrawEng in prone stpor of stm
On the hive-lip. Snowdrops. Two
* buzzards
Still-woings, each
Ma.gnetised to the other, Float orbits.
Cattle standing warm. Lit, happy stillness.
Hughes is a most uneven writer. but when. he notices and celebrates something that goes beyond his own fancy Be is a goodzone. This book is heartening. in .that it suggests soime return, to the roots of his 6trength.
C. H. Sisson, hardly knowvn at all when Gunn and Hughes were . already attracting much critical attention. is old enough (just about) to. be their father. Sisson's reputation has grown steadily throughout the decade so that he is now usually aecorded the.respect he is due as. a major poet by any stand. aNrs. Sisson published original. verse <only in the magazines during 1979, .but:. he did, bring out hiS transltion of Some Tales.of La Fontaine -(Carcanet, £4.50)X. lightweight but delightful volume, notable foir its good humour and its command of an id.iomiatic - told"" style wbich never sounds like translateresc.

He is, as you would expect,. one of the few living poets who can make you laugh out loud.

Faber Book of Sonnets where Htis admirable ""A Note on WyaLtt"" will certainly find a p:lace if it ever runs to a revised edition. I quote the first four lines to illustrate his skill:
See her come bearing down, a tidy
craft !
Gaily her topsoils bulge, her side-
lights: burn !
There's jigging in her rigging,fOre
and af t,
And beauty's self, not nane,
limned on her stern.
The metaphor of the woman as ship is cleverly sustained, with just as much brilliance as you find in early Gunn, and Amis is better than Gunn when it comes to bending current twists and turns of speech to the shape of his verse. He is a literary poet with a sharp eata for slang; the combination makes for a readable and entertaining collection.
Peter Redgrove,, I,Imagine, is the sort of writer Amis would abhor. His ' The Weddings at Nether Powers and Other New Poems (Routledge, £2.95) contains all manner of visceral incantatory stuff, no trace of a sense of humour, and a solemn commit. ment. to his own teuius which would be embarrassing did not Redgrove, every once in a While, come up with an image w""ic no one else could have dreamt of: ""The, centipede like a strolling knot-loaf "".

Perfecr, .too, Is Ambrose Bierce's-definition of -an egotist -as "" A persbn of low taste, more interested in himself than in me "". But such pleasures take some findinig. When Kingsley Amis colleczed The New Oxford Book of Light Verse int.1977, he, omitted American-poets almost entirely-partly from inclina. .ti4n,. perhaps, but chiefly because this anthology by Wiliani Harmon had already been.. planned to complement his: Auden's Anglo-American territory in the original Oxford Book of Light Verse of 1938, now renrinted as a paperback (Oxford, £3.50), was being cut in two. All anthologies conduct campaigns in taste-the more personal the more campaigning -and as Amis departed radically from the populist tone of Auden so, from the start, does Harmon take issue with Amis.
The Professor of English at Chapel Hill is genial enough, but irredeemably donnish and windy, and instead of Am-is's tough, terse and wholly consistent apologia, Harmon first attempts, not too successfullv', to define ways in which American Lighit Verse is peculiarly American and then writes, of the dark, destructive side of comedy: ""This Dionysian, anarchic id-spirit of misrule seems to represent the pre-so-cial and pre-logical Individual-as dear to American conservatives as to JeanJacques Rousseau-the Individual who can turn every solemn civic utterance into rude and incult parody"".
For heaven's sake. None of this would matter more than the normal difference between a dissertation and a seminar did not a sense of purpose in the choice of the poems themselves prove equally elusive. There is simply too much: the vision blurs. Amis compressed more than 400 years of English poetry into 121 poets and 329 pages; Harmon, with half that number of years to work on, takes half as many poets again and 528 pages to make his choice. Inevitably,. and unnecessarily, the general level of verse is far lower than in the English collection, and some of it-restricting the representation and diminishing theimpact of talents like ""Orpheus C. Kerr "", John Greenleaf Whittier, Innes Randolph, Phyllis McGinley and Ogden Nash-should not be there at all.
One problem when 'choosing the poems for an an.thology of this kind is tlat America lacks the received tradition of High Verse-no Shakespeare, Milton, Wordsworth or Pcpe-which Light Verse needs to kick against and take off. What she does possess, or so it laoks from over here. is a rich nineteenth century folk poetry, and a twentieth centurY skill in the metropolitan lyric that i;s .unrivalled. It is with its handling; of these truly Americ6n forms that The Oxford Book 4f,Ameri can Light Verse seems- both timorous and unbalartced.

True, we get the who:le of ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" and "" Meet Me in St Louis, Louis ""; there is ""Little Brown Jug"" and a couple of coarse exchanges from the Civil War, but apart from ""Clementine"" and ""Starving to. Death on a Government Claim "", not much from California, and still less from the railroads-after all, Bill Bailey (ivho is present) was a brakeman on the Baltimore and Ohio. I should have liked more poems of immigrant life, since those chosen are mostly Germ man, and convivially, irresistibly comic:

It is probably true that manir lyrics for the stage. lose bones and flesh when separated from their melody-even ""Anything' Goes "" needs a singer'5 phrasing and thiat tiny intake of breath to loop Cole Porter's internal rhymes into the memory of the line before-but the other examples of Porter (five), Hart (five); - Hammerstein (three) and Ira Gershwsin (only two!) earn their plac&w'ithout music so well that it seerms more than a shaxtie to have only one lyric' each from Frank Loesser, Johnny Mercer ("".Jubilation T. Cornpone "", hardly *typical) anid Stephen Sondlheim ("" Gee, Officer l(rupke "", ditto)' and nothirig' by Kern, Berlin, Alan 'Jay Lerner; or' Richard Wilbur at all.
Perhaps Professor. Harmon would describe what I miss as Popular or Folk. Verse that is not High can ;also be Nonsense (on the whole, an un-American activity) or Comic, not to men'tion..

Building his anthology on the massive foundations of Lear and Carroll at t-heir most brilliant and disturbing Geoffrey Grigson also provides a rich and idiosyncratic choice of sometimes unfamiliar stuff by, among others, Christian Morgenstern (Grigson's translation), Daniel Kharms, Charles Cros, Robert Desnos and.George du Maurier all in French, and a huge body of work by Mr Amis's least fav-. ourite poet, Anon (e.g. ""Oh, that my lungs could bleat like butter'd pease "" c. 1655). Many might also be- Comic, Popular or Ligh;, , btqt that a darkingredient of ihstability thickens the brew. ""Little birds are dining/Warily and well "".
It is hard to imagine either Oxford or Faber blessing an anthology of Silly Verse, but for devotees of the genre and for gigglers of all ages The Children's Book of Comic Verse (Batsford £3.95) assembles, a treasury of much silliness and joy. 1tere is a world trembling with the.temptations of outrage and disobedience, of knickers and wvigs and bad manners at table, of' murdering minors andrichly deserved fates.

"Jarrett-Kerr,, Martin",Reconciling the claims of poetry and Revelation,The Times,1979-Nov-24,"London, England","Reconciling the claims of p!oetry and Revelation
During the past eight years The Times has been running an occasional series 'of articles concemed with Literature and Religion. Martin Jarrett-Kerr, whose piece on Gerard Manley Hopkins initiated the series, has made the suggestion that the series should be given a new lease of life.
Literature and Religion-or Religion and Literature ? There is a real differerce. "" Literature and Religion "" suggests that the primary emphasis is on literature: but that the very study of literature "" for its own sake "" reveals, incidentally, certain convictions about life, its meaning and levels of valuation, death and its signals. eternity or nullity, which are usual topics of religious discourse. The danger is that these ""religious"" elements are seen as peripheral to the real business of writing well, and religion becomes a series of secondary options, decorative trinkets picked up in the Portobello Road. ""Religion and Literature "", on the other hand, starts from the primacy of reEigious faith, ,and then seeks tell-tale t,races of itself in drama, poetry, the novel. Here the danger is that literature will be plundered, its ""sacred"" bits lopped off and the residue discarded.
This occasional series prefers, on the whole, the first danger. Religion, if true, has nbthing to fear-from an identity parade -competing with others in a "" pluralistic "" row. Indeed, the second danger is the- most serious even fromn a religious point of view. For not to take seriously literature's claim to full attention is to commit sacrilege, howvever ""`religious"" the intent. So we opt for ""Literature and Religion "".
But is this not already to take sides in another dispute: that between the "" high "", and the ""low"" valuation of literature? Shelley's expression of the ""high "" view is well-known: poets are the "" unacknowledged legislators of the world "", orless well-known-the earlier statement, "" Poetry redeems from decay the visitations of divinity in man"". Goethe claimed that fate ""has exalted the poet "" above the toils, passions and rages of man, "" as if he were a god "".
By contrast, we have the more modest view of the function of literature. T. S. Eliot, for instance, noting the high claims made for poetry, said ""If a poem of mine entitled Ash Wednesday ever goes into, a second edition, I have thought of prefixing to it the lines of Byron in Don Juan:
I don't pretend that I quite
understand My meaning when I wrould be
very fineBut the fact is that I have
'nothing planned Except perhaps to be a moment'
merry. Even more blunt is Auden's formulation:
Art is compatible with polytheism and with Christianity, but not with philosophical materialism; science
is - compatible ivith philosophical' maTerialism and wvitli Christianuty, but not wvith polytheism. No artist or scientist, however, tan feel comfortable as a Christian; every artist who happens to be a Christian wishes he could be a polyt-ieist; every scientist in the same position vishes that he could be a philosophical materialist. And with good reason. In a polytheist society, the artists are its theologians; in a materialist society, its theologians are the scientists. To a Christian, however,' both art and science are secular activities, that is to-say, small beer
Perhaps Auden's tongue was a little in his cheek. But it looks as if a high view of religious Revelation (which Eliot and Auden had) must go with a low view of poetry; whereas a low view of Revelation (and both Goethe and Shelley rejected' the Christian view) must go with a high' view of poefry.
But'if we look wider we see
the matter is not so simple. Shakespeare had a high view of his art-for surely he speaks in the Chorus, preluding H'enry V. O for a muse of fit, 'that would
ascend
the brightest heaven of inven-
tion....
Those wvho believe Shakespeare was a Renaissance sceptic will say that this proves the above -that a high view of poetry goes with a low rating for Revelation. But wait:
Sing, heavenly Muse, that on
the secret top
Of Greb, or of Sinai, didst
inspire
That shepheard -[Moses].... Mlilton. had as high claims for poetry as Shakespeare: yet this opening of Paradise Lost identifies the Muse with the Divine Logos. And Wordswvorth echoes this in his "" Prospectus "" to his unwnritten epic, "" The Recluse"": Urania, I shall. need
Thy presence, or a greater muse
if such
Descend to earth or dwell in
highest heaven.
Thus even Wordswoith, like Milton, was able to combine a high view of the poetic calliig- with an equally high view of divine revelation.:
Of course it"" wasi harder. for.
Wordswvorth than for AMilton to hold both together; and it is still harder,for their successors today. Yet ave still have those who can write, as Patrick White did:
I suppose what I am increasingly intent on trying to do in my books is to give professed unbelievers glimpses of their own unprofessed factor. . . The churches defeat their own aims . . . t'arough the banality of their approach, and bv rejecting so much that is sordid and shocking which can still be related to religious experience ... I feel t.at the. moral flaws in myself are more than anything my creative source.
And the distinguished novelist and (above all) short-story wvriter-who died tragically so young-Flannerv O'Connor has it in more specifically Christian terms. Looking at the true calling of the wiriter she says that it is concerned with ""what is distinctive in man"". For the real identity of man cannot be found by Gallup Polls. ""It is not made from what passes, but from those qualities that endure . . . it lies very deep. In its entirety, it is knoivn only to God, but of those who look for it, none gets so close as the artist "".

Inoculation, heavenly maid. descend! English verse is rich in cxnic possibilities, not all of them as unintentional as that line singled out for quotation by Coleridge in Biographia Literaria. You will find it, together with much else in the same vein, in that matchless ""anthology of bad ver'se"" compiled by D. B. Wyndham Lewis and Charles LGe, The Stuffed Owl, first published ir. 1930 and now available again in an Everyman hardcover edition (Dent, Â£3.95). The secret of The Stuffed Owl is that it contains only good bad verse-that is, verse written according to the rules, innocent of faults of craftsmanship, but hilariously inept in effect. As in these lines from Wordsworth: This piteous news so much it shocked her,/She qaite forgot to send the Doctor. Or these from Mrs Browning: Our Euripedes, the human,/With his droppings of warm tears. Lewis and Lee had a killing eye for the ludicrous. Their anthology remains a classic of literary malice.

Ewanrt is a skilled technician with' a' good rude sense of humour. considerable command of
dramatic effects, and a nice quirky interest- in off-beat subjects. I prefer him to Betjeman for two reasons: he is not so evasively trivial, and he is mucli less predictable both in what he chooses to write about and the way in which he writes it. His work is difficult to qutote fairly; his successes are. a matter of tone and cumulative effect, rather than clever stanzas or individual pay-off lines. I think this book would give entertainment to any literate reader, and make an ideal Christmas present for anyone wanting to give something indubitably modern and sophisticated but at the same time great fun to read. In short, give it to anyone who would not be seen dead within reach of the work of Pam Ayres -Thoughts of a Late-Night KInitter (Arrow Books, Â£1), Some of me poetry (Arrow Books, Â£1), Some more of me poefry (Arrow Bo6oks, Â£1),- and All Pam's Poems (Hutchinson, Â£2.95).

The Ordeal of Ivor Gurney By Michael Hurd (Oxford, Â£5.95)
This is the first biography of Ivor Gurney, composer of songs and of poetry (1890-1937). To those who know his work and have been led to believe that he went mad because of the wvar, this will make even sadder reading. Mr Hurd shows clearly that the instability was innate.
Gurney came from a poor Gloucestershire family. His voice as a choirboy (he once stood in tor a drunken soprano at the Three Choirs Festival and sang with Albani ! ) led to his being helped by various educated people who recognized his exceptional musicality; but this also led to a growing alienation from his family; so from the age of 10 he -war rootless, or at home in other people's homes.
He was self-absorbed, confident of his own powers and impervious to his teachers'
criticisms, yet as the author shows, both lovable and
itterly sincere. In 1911 he won a scholarship to the RCM. He looked like Schubert and had no regard for clothes or meals; but everyone, even Stanford who tried to teach him, had the greatest hopes-in particular Marion Scott, who also taught there. She was a "" motherfigure"" who saw his potential genius and also his 'hopeless incapacity for taking pains or fitting into any social pattern. Ilis eccentric behaviour was already alarming his friends, Herbert Howells, Will Harvey and John Haines, all Gloucestershire men.
Up to this point in his book Mr Hurd is an excellent chronicler, though with a tendency to conjectures: ""Possibly"" or ""he must have "". He isn't so hlappy when it comes to the War, interspersing Gurney's letters with bits of potted comment on its military conduct. Later in the book he speaks of Gurney's poetry as having a therapeutic element But it was the war itself that Gurney hoped would help him; he already referred to himself
as ""neurasthenic "". If one dare call the Western Front "" in. stitutional "" or "" social "", for Gurney it was, and what is so dreadful is that he knew he had need of it. He was happy and ""normal"" among comrades, men from Gloucestershire. He wrote poetry; he even composed songs. But in his later poetry, it is always Gurney's War.
He was back in England early in 1918, lightly wounded and slightly gassed. He had begun to hear voices; and an account of a long conversation he had with Beethoven was disturbing. However he managed to take up his schol;arship again, taught now by Vaughan Williams. He was known a bit; everyone tried to help and in the years 1919-22 he worked frantically, while living a crazy vagrant existence-playing in cinemas, labouring, never anything for long. Rut still there were great hopes for him. He had published two books of poems and his settings, particularly of conteMporary poets were being noticed. But the voices grew more insistent; he aimed at suicide; felt himself actually tormented by ""the wireless"" and "" Electricity "".
In 1922 he had to be ""shut
up"" and remained in Dartford asylum for 15 years, visited by the devoted Marion Scott, and others, till he died of TB, his writing degenerating into nonsense, his music into silence. It is a sombre and distressful story.
Yet it is essentlal to look at what he left as if one didn't know. He is crystallized in his best songs and poems; it is essential to see Gurney the artist, and the extravagant claims Mr Eurd makes, in his touching but naif enthusiasm, won't really help. But Gurney is abidingly worth reading and, what's more, his Poens, with a truly perceptive memoir by Edmund Blunden, are acually in print (Chato, 1973). Gerald Finzi and his wife did everything possible to foster his music, and this too is avalable.
To bring to life someone as odd as Gurney has proved beyond the author's powers-it would probably be beyond anybody's-and the best bits in the book are Gurney's letters and poems: but so they should be. "".. . no history of November keep the guy "", he wrote. It's a line that seems to sum up why he is worth remembering.

"Nye, Robert",Poetry,The Times,1978-Oct-26,"London, England","Poetry
"" The really hard thing, as Henry James might have said, is to make your own destiny coincide w.%ith the necessity of your art."" Henry James did not quite say it. The Australian poet Peter Porter does, in the course of a survey of the state of poetrv in the last quarter century in Britain, published in the magazine Encounter (80p) which is celebrating its twentyfifth birthday. Mr Porters point is sensible. He observes that most poets are forced to fake the coincidence-""if only because they cannot bear the thought of being judged irrelevant by history."" And he goes on: ""But the future will not divulge its taste, and those who woo Prince Posterity most desperately,may be surprised to find him ignoring them.""
One of the poets singled out for praise by Mr Porter is Geoffrey Hill, whose work he notes (in a less felicitous phrase) as being admired by "" each end of the taste spece trum "". Admiration is indeed what I feel in reading the verse in Mr Hill's new collection Tenebrae (Andre Deutsch, Â£2.50). He has returned to the strict forms which characterized his earlv work, and within those forms be refines his thoughts and feelings so astringently that one would be hard put to find a slack line in the book. The twvo sonnet sequences entitled "" Lachrimae ' and ""An Apology for the Revival of Christian Architecture in England"" are especially impressive.
The only fault I would note in Mr Hill at this stage in-his interesting progress is that he tends to use his mastery of form as an excuse for remaining tight-lipped. A good sonnet releases as much as it contains, but this poet is unw-illing to make the act of surrender wshich woulld allows him to wvrite in that way.. The result is sometimes over-polished and Parnassian, SD that the reader is more moved to admire than to be moved. All the same, the seziousness of this volume is self-evident and it stands out from the ruck of contemporarv verse as something excellently made, the wvork of a craftsman probably well alware of what he needs to do in order to become an artist.
George Barker's villa Stellar (Faber paperbacks, Â£2.S0) Provides an illuminating contrast. Mr Barlker began, nearly half a century ago, as a hit-ormiss man, a wild artist if ever there was one, a high Romantic throwing his talents down in poem after poem from the precipice of self to commit suicide on some rude and rugged pun. He has changed a good deal over the years, though without ever losing wshat wvas admirable in such daring, and anyone who thinks that they knoV (and probably dislike) him because of those early excesses ought to take a look at what he is doing now. The verse in Villa Stellar continues in much the same vein as his last book, Dialogues, remembering people and places wsith mordant affee-
tion, employing a kind of wit vhich has been rare in English poetry since the death of ByronL The particular essence of George Barker seems to me best suggested by adapting Byron's famous remark that after the publication of Childe Harold he woke up and found himself famous, because in most of Barker's later work it is as though Byron had wvoken up and found himself William Blake. The confidence of the Blakean exercise, seldom lapses into bathos now, but as a matter of taste I prefer the Byronic quips:
You ask me where I atm going ? IVeU, Pin either passing througlz Italy on my way to Hell,
or, to put the matter a bit too wittily,
passing throughl Hell on my way to ltaLZ.
Villa Stellar abounds in things as quotable and relaxed and entertaining as that. It is, to employ a useful word coined by James Joyce, jocoserious.
Jocoseriousness also characterizes the best noenis in Geoffrey Grigson's The Fiesta and Other Poems (Secker & Warburg, E3.50) especially a handful of love poems. that succeed in the difficult business of being personal without being coy or messy. Grigson is another poet wvho has written nearly all his finest work late in life-in his case, more or less since the publication of his Collected Poems f963). I do not think any critic sh'ould try to discover why this may be so, although the reasons can be clearly felt in the freer rhyrthms and authority of language in the itfore recent books. A poem here, entitled "" Visit from a Biographer "", provides a clue and then quite properly instructs us to shut up vith such speculation. It is about an encounter wvhich Mr Grigson had with someone wanting to wvrite a biography of Norman Cameron, and his refusal to gossip about thatsuperb poet whose wvork has much in comrmon with his own.
I have room onlv to recomnmend two books by younger poets-Peter Ackroyd and Craig Raine. Both seem to me of the highest promise. Mr Ackrovf4s Co=nthy Life (Ferry Press, 177 Green Lane,; London, SE9, Â£1.50) is remarkable, howvever difficult most of the psems may be to understand individually, because it is unmistakably the work of a poet for whom words are the experience. He has something of the quality of early Auden or r2cent John Ashbery -an air of being wounded into speaking, while remaining cold in what he says and how he says it. That coldness. which has nothing to do wvith a lack of feeling, gives the work a,uthority. Anyone vwho cares about poeni- should seek this book out and refer immediately tv page 33, where there is a poent ""about"" tbe coldness I speak of. It is the final poem in the book, and I assume by this'.that MIr Ackrrovd knows exactlv what he is doing. Ir Raine is more uticertairi, but the tit!e poem in his volume The Onion, M1eihory (Oxford, Â£2.23) has a similar self-awareness. and if he cl-n go on revisiting the mood that made it then there may well be another genuine new poet on the sgene.

Taking it seriously
The New Oxford Book of Light Versc
Chosen and edited by Kingsley Amis
(Oxford, £4.50)
The original Oxford Book of Light Yerse was edited by Auden and published in 1938. The first thing to be said about The New Oxford Book of Light Verse is that Kingsley Amis has produced a selection as unlike his predecessor's as it could possibly be and, that vhile you may well wyish to possess both, you could not agree with them equally. Auden is eccentric and full of surprises, but Amis, I believe, is more apropos.
The tsvo editors have one thing in cormnon. Both begin by taking light verse seriously: where pleasure and amusement are concerned only the best will do. Auden, however, declared that light verse was one of the vital luxuries of democratic freedom, and should speak in the contemporary language of its audience. This allowved him to include Kipling's harrowing ""Danny Deever"" and to omit the immortal but hardly colloquial ""Jabber-wocky"" in favour of things like this:
Tlhay set orn ther nollys For to kepc thzer pollys, Godc blake bollgs.
For batryng of batts.
And so on, for some nine pages and 26 stanzas of ""The Tournament of Tottenham "", wvith notes at the foot of each page. Sounding in his introduction more bracingly like the original Jim Dixon than for some years, Amis will have none of this, and vith one sivinge removes from his choice all literature before Shakespeare-Skelton, for instance, for committing both unforgivable crimes, of being (a) unfunny and, if not unfunny then (b) obscure--and reduces the contributions of Anon from well over a half to less than one tenth. (""The Vicar of Bray"" is a rare point of accord.) In pursuit of the true vox populi Auden included so many anonymous folk-songs and ballads that he left insufficient room for poets of provenance and name. Mr Amis restores the field of light verse to the professionals in a fastidious and patLician selection. Rude, too, of course, from time to time:
An Argentine gaucho named
Bruno
Declared, "" There is one thing I
do know: A woman is fine
And a boy is divine,
But a llama is numero uno""
Auden further limited himself to poems not already in ""Q's"" Oxford Book of English Verse, but Amis has sensibly gone straight for what he likes best, irrespective of the poems chosen. by Helen Gardner and rPhilip Larkin for The New Oxford Book.of English Verse and The Oxforcd Bonk of.Twen-. tietit Century English Verse: at least one poem. MacNeice's, thrumming ""Bagpipe Music "", is in all three. Amis omits Pope and Dryden on his own grounds that the former's unpleasantness and the latter's high tone deprive them of the requisite lightness, and from Auden's list he also removes Herrick, and demotes Edward Lear as too whimsical (or, perversely, in The Owl and the Pussycat, as too ""touching""). He has also managed to round up an unusually large number of poems savaging Wordsworth, a cause near his heart.
Above all, Amis removes light verse from the uncertain claims of populist art and places it squarely where it belongs: in the century and a quarter between Byron and Betieman. (In many -ways "" A Subaltern's Love-song "" ise the perfect light verse.) His heroes are poets like Winthrop Mackworth Praed (1802-1839), Charles Stuart Calverley (1831-1884) and W. S. Gilbert, who is in with the grisly-grim "" Yarn of the 'Nancy Bell""' and.with songs from Pinafore, Pirates (2), lolanthe (the nightmare, which Auden had, too) and Ruddigore. All three combine a brilliant technique with asperity of mind and a (reasonably) generous heart. Each has the superb confidence to stand cliches and pretensions on their bead and mock, without destroying, them.
To me the least familiar was Calverley, an invalid lawyer and Fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge, master of the precise inconsequence certain to tumble a high Victorian tea-party. into a felicity of helpless giggling: Forever! What abysms of woe
The word reveals, what frenzy,
what
Despair! For ever (printed so} Did not.
Amis chooses six Calverley poems, and all are funny. Auden chose one, and that, characteristically, a wistful, but unfunny poem about memories of Cambridge. Praed's breathtaking ""Good-Night to- the Season ! "" explodes through both anthologies, of course, as it is also honoured in Gardner, but Amis scores by matching it with Ted Pauker's very clever pastiche (""A Grouchy. Good Night to the Academic Year"") which perfectly expresses the editor's owvn views. on the lunacy of further education in the modern,age. (Likewise the pleasures of drinking and the impossibility of foreigners are reflected in The. New Oxford Book of Light Verse.)- Pauker is much less successful with ""A Trifle for Trafalgar a. parody of Chesterton's ""Antichrist."" ode, with Edward Heath as monosyllabic stand-in for the original F. E. Smith. Chesterton was devastatingly,angry and wrote a much funnier poem: Mr Pauker, alias Robert Conquest, is playing at scales. -
There are oddities. Americans just creep in, with Frost and Bret Harte, but there is no Ogden Nash and nothing. from Hollywood or Broadway (what about Sondheim ?). Amis believes that most performing lyrics look flat in collections like this, and the point is proved not by ""Mad Dogs and Englishmen "", which is inviolate, but by his second Coward choice-"" Bad Times are Just Around the Corner"", which palls most horribly offstage. I think his view of light verse in the seventies is excessively bleak and that, if he could find room for Alan Bennett's Betjeman parody ("" Place-Names of China""), he should, by his own demands for technique at the service of entertainment, have included somethilg -by Tony Harrison and Christopher Logue. But if there is anything more deadly than a Skelton unfunny it is an Amis unamused, and he rightly relies on his positive responses to provide a reliable and sympathetic guide. The result is a rich and relaxed collection.

John Masefield: Selected Poems
lVith a preface by John Betjeman
(Heinemann, £f5.90)
Tohn Masefield was born 100 years ago today. The remembrance is unlikely to set a younger generation on fire. Yet, as the present Poet Laureate says in introducing this handy volume of selections from Masefield's verses, the man vrote two lyrics which will be remembered as long as the language lasts (no prize for guessing that he means "" SeaFever"" and ""Cargoes"", though he then goes on to refer to these, rather oddly, by means of their first lines and not their titles). He also wrote three narrative poems wvhich have a vigour and a freshness quite distinct from anything perpetrated by his boring contemporaries - The Everlasting Mercy (1911), Dauber (1913), and Reunard the Fox (1919). Masefield is absolutely out of fashion now. He was overvalued in his owvn lifetime. so no doubt there is justice in this reaction. But English poetry rejects some of its owvn virtues and possibilities if it quite forgets effects like these:
""After him."" "" Catch him.""
Out him."" "" Scrob him.""
""Wle'll give him hell."" "" By God, ue'll mob him.""
"" We'll dick- him, scrout him, flog him, fratch him.""
"" All right "" I said. "" But first you'll catch him.""
That is from The Everlasting Mercy. If you compare it wvith the work of an earlier poet wvho succeeded in capturing and enacting the rhythms of colloquial. speech in his versesay, Wlilliam Barnes-then it does not look or sound particularly startling. Masefield wvas never really as revolutionary as he seemed to be, and it is true that he injected a spurious:realism into his verse by1 the u'se of somewvhat silly verbs'supposed to contain considerable masculinity-"" scrob "" and "" fratch ""-and, famously, by all that use of invective: ""You. closhy put."" /"" You bloody liar "", and so forth. The point is that it does not
really work. Masefield should be given marks for recognizing that the gentility of his contemporaries was unacceptable. He cannot, in all fairness, be saluted for releasing them from that gentility in his oNvn poetry. He is nearer Browning than he is near Barnes. He tried to sound as though he was writing in his. shirt sleeves.
This is to criticize John Masefield by high standards, the standards that his own best work demands. There was precious little of that best, if any, after he became Poet Laureate in 1930-a fact which seems to have impressed itseli uncomfortably u;-on Betjeman, who notes that someone should have written a letter to Masefield telling him that he did not have to submit verses on topical events to this newspaper. ""The Laureateship "", declares Sir John, ""is nowv officially regarded not as a spur to further verse writing but as a reward, as Eric Gillett described it to me. for, work already done.""
It w us Masefield's sense of duty that caused him to submit atrocious poems to The Times. Doubtless it was a sense of duty on the part of The Times that caused it to print them. As Sir John adds, with his tongue somewhere near his cheek, I should guess: ""The appointment (of the Laureatesnip) is
in the gift of the Prime Minister wrho advises the Queen. Ramsay Macdonald advised the appointment of Masefield.""
Perhaps we are now far enough away from Masefield's official fame to recognize his genuine minor gifts ? There are one or two other poems in this selected volume, besides the couple singled out by Betjeman, which might well live.
There is also the little niatter of Masefield's novels: among them Jim Davis (1911), Sard Harker (1924),. Odtaa (1926), and Dead Ned (1938). There is a case to be made that his best work was done in prose. Simple racy, straightforward prose. The kind of thing he was always trying to force into verse came naturally enough to him when he abandoned poetic form and let himself go with stories in the manner of Robert Louis Stevenson.
With the present Laureate, I hope that . this book gains Masefield new readers. Unlike him, apparently, I hope that those same new readers will transfer their disappointment with Masefield's verse into an interest in his prose. The first good thing to be said about that prose is that there is no crippling sense of duty in it.

Basil Bunting once described .limself: Minor poet, not conspicuously dishonest. It is a 'good description, and an honourable one, and I think it is borne out by the work in his Collected Poems (Oxford £3.75, E2.25 paperback). Overshadowed .or years by standing in the reputation of Ezra Pound, and 'repeatedly written off as a disciple ,it was the sonata-like long poem Briggflatts (1966) which compelled reassessment of this neglected English poet, now 78 vears old. What is attractive about Briggflatts is the way in which it marries personal experience and landscape with the wider world of historical allusion. But if I wvere introducing Bunting to someone who had never read a line of his, I would choose something less ambitious, some. thing precise and unforgettable, such as'
Not to thank dogwood nor the wind that sifts
petals are these words, nor for a record,
but, as notes sung and received still the air,
these are controlled by yesterdap evering, a peal after
the beZls have rested.
The current issue of the little magazine Agenda is a special Basil Bunting issue, in which there is a valuable transcript of some remarks made by the poet himself on what he was trying to do in Briggflatts. Agenda costs 90p and is available from 5 Cranbourne Court, Albert Bridge Road, London, SW1l 4PE.
Two other volumes of a life's work deserve respect, and more. Allen Tate's Collected Poems 1919-1976 (Faber, E6.95) demonstrate that he must have serious claims to be considered the leading rhetorician of his generation of American poets. If I cannot warm to his verse it may be because he sets out to chill us with a classical assurance that never lets the reader forget that this is art with a capital A. I miss the overheard note. In Bunting's terms, Tate's bells are forever resonant. but there is rarely a peal to linger in the mind after they have done their solemn job. I make an exception of one or two of the earlier poems, notably the superb lines which begin:
T1re idiot greens t1he meadow
with his eues.... Anyone who can make every word work for its keep in the way that he does is plainly a considerable poet. I wish Tate had wvritten more poems as compact, and with as unwavering a rhythm. The Complete Poems of Keith Douglas, edited by Desmond Graham (Oxford, £3.95), confirms that when Douglas wYas killed in Normandy, three days after D-day at the age of 24, we lost the
finest poet to come out of the Second World War. Direct,. using words not to decorate, his thoughts and feelings butto hammer them into the shape of sense, Douglas wrote at least. seven poems wihich ensure his, survival among the English poets. I quote the two quatrains which conclude Vergissnzeine
nicht. since there is as muchlj poetry in this pity as in anything by Wilfred Owven a war earlier:
But she would weep to see today how on his skin the swart flies
move;
the dust upon the paper epc
and the bzrst stomach like a cave. For here thze lover and killer arc
iningled whlo had on7e body and onze heart.. And deathz who had the soldier

Two volumes of posthumous pieces, Robert Lowvell's Day bv?
Day (Faber, f3.95) and John., Berryman's Henry's Fate and Other Poems (Faber Paperback,' £2.75) do not seem to me to add much to the stature of either of the poets, and the Berryman in particular seems to be something in the nature of barrel-scraping since it consists of poems wvhich he rejected when putting together his last twvo books. Still I wvould be the last to deny that Berryman's anguished and conf used outpourings can touch the heart. What one requires of poetry, though, is that it touches the heart (and the mind) in such a wvay that the reader says: These words, yes, and no other, That is a precision approached in John Montague's The Great Cloak (Dolmen Press with. Oxford, £2.75), a collection of love poems that demand and reward careful reading at their own slow, sober, pain-informed pace, and most particularly in a little volume by A. Alvarez entitled Autunn to Autumn and Selected Poems 1953-1976 (Macmillan, £3.95). The last book is a real eye-opener. Alvarez is wvidely knowvn as a reviewver, but he has written few poems and never pushed or peddled. himself as a poet. WhTbat comes. off from this most distinguished selection is a sense of authenticitv and necessity. The poems have been -wrung from the poet: almost against his wvill. I am reminded of something John Aubrey once said about Sir Walter Ralegh: ""He was sometimes a poet; not often."" That is true of most poets, on]y most poets publish all the stuff they write, so that time has to sort out the occasions wvhen they, were poets at the moment of writing. Alvarez, like Ralegh, seems to have mastered the art of holding his own poetic ambitions in check. He writes poems when he is a poet. Thatis not often. But it is often enough to make this a book to set beside Norman Cameron's The Winter House or Martin Seymour-Smith's Reminiscences of Norma-in other wvords, with the best of the neglected and unfashionable and utterly genuine poets of our rather nasty century.

Men Who March Away
Poems of the First World War Edited by I. M. Parsons
(Chatto & Windus. Â£1.50)
Out of Battle
The Poetry of the Great War By Jon Silkin (Oxford, Â£2.50)
Jon Silkin examines the motivations and feelings of the poets by reference to a representative selection of them, while Ian Parsons gives the feel of the poetry itself, also by. representative selection. Their choices of
exemplars are remarkably simi-. lar, and more than tvo-thirds. of the authors whose poetry has been included by Mr Par. sons are also considered by Mr Silkin. Indeed, apart from its own intrinsic appeal, Men Who March Away provides the ""illustrations"", as it were, for Out of Battle.
In a necessarily limited yet admirably lucid introduction to the poems he has chosen and arranged, Ian Parsons refers in passing to wvhat Cyril Connolly called "" the explosion of Georgian Marsh-gas."" Jon Silkin enlarges on the topic of that phenomenon, tracing a continuum from Coleridge and Wordsworth (with their sometimes agonised reactions to the French Revolution and the subsequent French ImperiWlism),t
through Shelley and Byron to Hardy and the Georgians, and so to the war poets, some of them leading lights in that ""Georgian"" school.
Yet, with the ruthless honesty marking his whole study, Mr Silkin says at one point that ""The enthusiasm for the war remains a puzzle "". Since he wrote those words the definitive biography of Julian Grenfell has appeared, giving a clue to th^ enthusiasm of upper-class young men-a cleansing of their self-assumed guilt-stains with a wallowv in mud and blood-but what of the rest? Possibly some part of the answer is summed up by Chesterton (who is not even mentioned by Mr Silkin, although it might be thought that GK's bitter comparison between the fate of the rulers and that of the fighting-men would have struck a responsive chord) when he has his working-class Briton say.
I knew 110 ill of Boneu, anud
plentv of the squire, And for to fight the Frenchizan t
did not mnzch admire, But I did bash hiis bagginets
because lie came arrayed To straighten out thte rolling road
an2 English drunkard made. Ian Parsons includes three of Chesterton's war poems, along wvith those of other writers who are surprisingly ignored completely by Jon Silkin, namely Wilfrid Gibson, Osbert Sitwell (who seems to say something special in ""The Next War ""), and Arthur Graeme West, wvho got into the army through the ranks despite eye weakness and died of a sniper's bullet. How could Mr Silkin not be drawn to
God ! Ihow I 7hate you, you uouing
cheerful ienz, Whose pious poetry blossoms on
your graves As soon as you are in them. ...
When all else is said, how stimulative of ever-fresh speculation is Jon Silkin's logically developed exploration, sometimes impassioned and often exciting. And how much its reasoning enhances appreciation-emotional and analytical -of the carefully selected, exceedingly evocative poems presented by Ian Parsons!

Little magazines are the life blood of new poetry. Auden made them rhyme with ""intellectual marines"". He should have known. After all, he had Geoffrey Grigson's New Verse behind him from the startand New Verse was arguably the best little magazine of the century so far. The Auden rhyme is intended to draw attention to the pioneering and exploratory qualities of a good magazine of this kind. If the little magazines do not take risks, then the big publishers can be guaranteed to take even fewer thar. 'usual. A healthy magazi.ne sceile does not create poets, of course, but it might make it a bit harder for the real ones to be ignored for ever.
Does fame nmatoz, ro the true poet ? It should not. But recognition is a different thing. There is a letter in which Gerard Manley Hopkins asserts that being known is "" the air the poet breathes "". Poor Hopkins had little enough of that air in his own life, and managed; yet, even then, the process is two-way, and we could regret that Browning and Swinburne had no opportunity to be startled into a fresh awareness of their own limitations by reading, say, Tlhe Windhiover.
Of all the current crop of literary magazines, Bananas, edited by Emma Tennant, is probably doing most to ensure that the real right thing does not go unrecognized. Starting in 1975, this quarterly newspaper of lbe arts quickly established for itself the reputation of being\ a bit rude, a bit tough, and a whole lot unpredictable. Now there is an anthology of writing from it, called simply Bananas (Quartet Books, £2.50), culled from the first eight issues, and certain trends become apparent. Bananas is feminist, aggressive. and committed to unfashionable excellence.
Would any other magazine of the moment dared to have printed Martin SeymourSmith's long and briliant analysis of what is wrong with contemporary English literary life, ""A Climate of Warm Indifference ""? This has some of the violent accuracy of Wyndham Lewis at his best, and Bananas almost merits comparison with Lewis's own magazine, Blast, in having an identifiable force and vigour, the impress of a strong directing intelligence in its editing. It has- published outstandingly fine stories by Angela Carter, J. G- Ballard, Ruth Fainlight, and Beryl Bainbridge. Mbre to the point of this column, it is regularly packed with interesting poetry-Peter Redgrove, Jenny Joseph, Ted Hughes, Elaine Feinstein, and Jeremy Hilton all appear in the anthology, and the magazine can claim to have discovered an unusually talented newcomer in Daniel Brand, who was only seventeen when he wrote the poem included here.
Bananas 9, the winter issue, is currently available, and well uip to standard (50p. from 2 Blenheim Crescent, London, W.11). Since publications of this kind depend upon reliable subscriptions, I will mention also that a cheque or postal order for £3 made payable to
Bananas Publishing wvill provide you with a year's supply.
Aquarius, edited by Eddie Linden, is more purely a poetry magazine. It has now run to ten numbers, and the tenth, in honour of John Heath-Stubbs in the year of his sixtieth birthday, is altogther worth acquiring (Flat 3, 116 Sutherland Avenue, London. W.9. 60p). This issue, guest-edited by Sebastian Barker, has photographs of Heath-Stubbs, and an interviesw with him, and poems and prose. pieces that celebrate his life and work, the contributors including George Barker, C. H. Sisson, David Wright, Gavin Ewart and Kathleen Raine. Another very vorthwhile magazine, Agenda, edited by William Cookson, devotes its latest issue (Vol. 15. No. 4-numbers suggesting an uncommon and commendable longevity in this field, incidentally) to translations from the French. Agenda is obtainable from 5 Cranbourne Court, Albert Bridge Road, London, SW1l 4PE, and costs 75p, or f3 for an annual subscription to four issues.
There is something peculiarly satisfying about reading r.eiv wsork in littie magazine format, in that the reader is allowved to treat some of the writing as his own discovery. However, if you miss out first turn around you can ahvayz catch up on the year's best ir. Poetry Dimension Annual S (Robson, £4.25 and £2.25) the anthology in which Dannie Abse selects the stuff wvhich seems to him most lasting from the past 12 months.
After little magazines, small publishers . . . Perhaps it is not surprising, given the present shortage of money iti the country, that much of the most interesting new work is coming from tiny private presses. Giles Gordon's The Oban Poems (Sceptre Press, £l.50) is one of those short, swift, unpretentious sequences best-suited to this kind of publication anywvay. It has all the qualities of Gordon's best prose-an observant eye, a strong sense of shape and rhythm, a quiet refusal of the easy options. Sceptre Press can be reached by addressing yourself to them at Knotting, Bedfordshire, MK44 1AF, but you had better hurrv because this edition iS limited to 150 copies and I should think it must be a collector's item from the start. By and large, I prefer to ignore such items, but wlhen the writer in question is as good and collectable as Gordon, or as genuine a poet as James Reeves, then I make an exception. Reeves, nowv nearly seventy, must have a serious claim to being the most undervalued poet in thf land, buit two smrall presses have donc him proud vwith his latest publications, both signed and limited editions, both exquisitely produred and illustrated. These are The Closed Door (Gruffyground Press, Ladram, Sidcot, Winscombe, Somerset f6) and Arcadian Ballads (The Whittington Press, Manor Farm, Andoversford, nr. Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, GL54 4HP. £25). The latter has pictures by Edward Ardizzone who has also signed it. The forrder, signed by the poet and the artist Richard Shirley Smith, has poems as good as this:

love. I think the past fro.n name to

To find each new love different And every love thc suirne.

Kingdom Come
King's Head
Irving Wardle
Stewart Parker's Belfast musical, Spokesong, dug some unexpected fun out of the British imperial slag-heap, and in this sequel Mr Parker tries to go one better and bring down two colonial birds with one stone.
To clarify that mixed metaphor, Kingdom Come takes place on a Caribbean island largely populated by Irish immigrants and concerns the festivities for the 300th anniversary of the settlement. A pageant committee assembles on the veranda of an hotel, ostensibly to plan the show, but really to hatch factional plots for an anniversary coup. Intrigue festers under the bland supervision of an old party called Pyecraft who seems to have Whitehall connexions. The black police chief is in league wvith a lady figurehead of th&e Protestant ascendancy; the black newspaper editor with a judge's daughter; the republican priest with an island girl called Teresa. By means of bombings, shootings, and mass poisoning each group hopes to wipe out the opposition.
I offer these details in the hope that they may guide intending spectators through the exotic foliage of Tony Tanner's production. It took me most of the evening to wvork tllem out. I still-cannot account for the mercenaries end strikers who are said to be lurking offstage, not to mention the founder-figure of Huge Flood who looms large in the first scene and then vanishes. It is also as much of a shock to the spectators as it is to the
chiaracters when the royal yacht appears purposefully on the horizon; up to that point, one had taken Macalla for an Irish protectorate.
A great deal of information is packed into the opening number which goes whizzing by, leaving you to work things out for yourself. Perhaps someone has taken the scissors to Mr Parker's book and snipped out Pyecraft's credentials, together wvith explanations of all the other random alliances in this sunkissed Ulster.
Suffice to say that whlen the great moment arrives, Teresa casts her Irish harp aside and reconciles the island's differences with a song in favour of the human race, which is promptly confirmed by the parade of the black nationalist as Britannia and the policeman as a leprechaun. And if you can put the story out of your head, there are other things to enjoy.
The songs mav often part company with the narrative, but they include some of the wittiest and most agile lyrics I have heard since the last Sondlreim. Shaun Davey's score excels in coupling Caribbean rhythms with the sound of the ceilidh, not to mention evocations of the old Savoy Hotel for the lady British Unionist. She is played by Sonia Graham, a ramrod Big House memsahib who abruptly comes on strong as a jazz dancer and close-harmony singer.
Her partner is Glenna Forster-Jones, radiating erotic danger in a golden boiler suit, alternating a sullenly impassive mask with a wide crocodile smile, and leading Carl Andrews into the evening's best number. Cy Grant as the police chief and Des Keogh as the priest and trigger-lhappy harpist, are other prominent contributors to this enjoyable mess.

Professing Poetry

by John Wain
(Macmillan, Â£6.95)
""Joln,"" says Yevtushenko, ""you are a very juicy man."" John tells us that Yevtushenko said that. Page 233. They are having lunch with others-"" We are on opposite sides of the table, but we signal to each other with understanding."" Wain ponders the meaning of being a juicy man. "" Since from his expression I see that this is a compliment, I assume he means that I am the opposite of a dry stick.""
So he is. A jticy man. Illdeed, juiciness is all in this rather unusual book. John Wain, poet, novelist, critic, has since late 1973 been the Professor of Poetry at Oxford. lie occupies, as they say, a chair. And it is a cnair which has been occupied by distinguished writers before him: Auden, Graves, Day Lewis, Blunden, Fuller. Most of these writers published the lectures which they delivered from that chair,
the ex cathIedra stuff. And tlhat, of course, is what Mr Wain is doing now. Only Professing Poetry, being the work of a juicy man, does not contain merely the words delivered from the chair, but the thoughts of the chairman on the way to the chair, and the circumstances in the local pub on the way home from the chair and so on and so forth. In other words, it is a set of Oxford Professor of Poetry Lectures (fairly formal pieces on Auden, on Larkin, on Empson, on Emily Dickinson, on Edward Thomas, and on more general topics such as "" Poetry and Social Criticism "") buttressed with chat about the gathering in the author's garden when the news came through that he had been elected, happy little reminiscences of the victory dance performed by his friends Philin Larkin and Peter Levi later thht niglht, extensive quotations from the wvork of younger poets he has encouraged while at Oxford and rather chummy wordpictures of them, all designed or throw n together to open a window not just on the author's mind but on his way of life.
The merit of the book is that it does provide a sort of continuum, and the reader is then free to decide whether be enjoys existing alongside it or even (if he can accept Mr Wain's blandishments) within it. A dry stick would march up to his chair and deliver his thoughts on, say, Empson and then retire. Mr Wain, all juicy, can not only range up and dowvn in Empson's work (where he has a distinguished track record, having been one of the very first to draw serious atten-
tiont to its uniqueness) but can tlhrow in provocative afterthoughts about Empson's lifestyle, muttering darTlly about his lack of a CBE, telling us that ""his blunt directness is that of the Yorkshire squire (though it was his elder brother, I believe, who inherited the broad acres ""). This gives Professing Poetry an unbuttoned quality wvhich is most uncommon in current literary criticism. If anything, it reminds me more of the tradition of table talk, rather than chair talk-the sort of remarks which Drummond of Hawthornden recalled being made by Ben Jonson, or which Coleridge could never 'be prevented from outpouring wvhether he had an audience or not. The snag is that Mr Wain (as the nine new poems at the back of this volume remind us) is certainly not a poet who can be mentioned in the same breath as Ben Jonson or Coleridge, and consequently his table talk is often mere chatter of little interest to anyone save his friends. But he is a generous man, and his habit of interspersing his lectures on the famous with puffs for the unknown is not necessarily a bad habit. One of these geese might really be a swan, and then a future generation will conclude that Mr Wain was a prophet as well as a professor.
Meanwhile, his book is readable, and easy-going, and decent with praise, and the lectures must certainly have inspired an undergraduate or two to assume that poetry is something one might try to write, and not just to analyse or evaluate. The professor is a professional.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS134971798/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=6de3e3b7

(Carcanet Press, £2)
Sheila Wingfield, now in her seventies, is perhaps about to be discovered again. I say ""again"" because her earliest work was praised by Yoats and Walter de la Mere, and then in the Forties she impressed Herbert Read and in the Fifties G. S. Fraser. Fraser is still impressed, and has provided a preface to Wingfield's Her Storms: Selected Poems 1938-1977 which contains a comprehensive selectin of tie work of a lifetime.
This book, taken together
with a volume of recent poems, Admissions: Poems 19741977 should be sufficient to bring her to general critical attention. The heartening thing is that she has done well enough without it. Here is a poet who has not spent all her spare time in a BBC studio, who is hardly represented in any of the anthologies, who has probably never given a public reading nor won a literary prizein short, a poet who has not played the dangerous game with Fame which so many twentieth century poets assume to be necessary to their careers. Indeed, Sheila Wingfield seems to me best recommended by the observation that she has never had a career, in that sense. She has simply pursued a lifelong vocation of writing poems. For this reason, and for others which no doubt strike deeper, her work has an uncommon but essential quality of necessity:
When Hsuang Tsung, great
emperor,
Giddy and ill, cffried in a litter, Saw the stars swap,
His conquests and his arguments And powers, faling into fever
with him,
Pulsed their lives awag.
Bow to his shade. To be at rest
is but a dog that sighs and settles: better
The unrelenting day.
That is a whole Wingfield
poem, not untypical in its tautness, its consonantal music, and its mnsistance upon the merits of even pain-flecked consciousness. The title of the poem is ""Poisoned in Search of the Medicine of Immortality"". If one of the jobs of poetry is to say hard things clearly, in words that come out of each other with such authority that alternative words seem impossible, then Sheila Wingfield can be sure of her place among the English poets.
Sebastiitn Barker can be sure of no such thing. His On the Rocks is by all reasonable reckoning a terrible book, an outpouring of sonnets-well, 14. line howls-on the subject of his wife's infidelity. Barker shouts and weeps and strikes murderous poses over the corpse of his own affections. His command of technique seems is no way adequate to the urgency of what he had to say. Why, then, is -the book worth mentiooning'? Because it finally eludes all reasonable reckoning, bemg the unmistakable real thing. Anyone bored as they should be by the timid lucubrations and evasions of so much contemporary verse will find in this book the note at least of an authentic passion:
0 my daughters, What a mother you have I Right
over tle horns of the moon
She threw my heart. Down, down,
into the dark
She let it drop. And on to the
bright Apollonian
She drove her radiant desire. And
now in the squeak
And scratch of meeting him she
holds the lover's inquest:
""Is this one dead, or t'other
one ? Which death do I like the best ? ""
Having quoted this, I see that it is both less clear and rather better written than most of the rest. If Barker can baild on the feeling for language which spurs him to such things as ""the squeak and scratch of meeting "", without losing any of the fury, the emotional and intellectual reality that has unbalanced this particular set of poems, then there may tell be a considerable new poet on the scene. His courage and his confidence are already commendable.
Frank Ormsby's A Store of Candles and Clive Wilmer's The Dwelling-Place are both first books. Neither is exactly -exciting, but Wilmer in particular seems deliberately to eschew ex. citement-and achieves some sober. well-crafted, sensible poetry as a result. Ormsby has a rieher sensibility, and a more various appreciation of scenes. but his verse is rougher-grained. even anecdotal, as though he were somehow determined to prove that the poet can be the fellow next door.
* Christmas is ""coming, but none of the books I have mentioned (with the exception of Sheila Wingfield?§) would make much of a present for. someone ,with a general: interest in modern verse. Specifically as presents, I recfimend an edition of Wallace.. Stevens's masterpiece The Man with the Blue Guitar, which has etchings by David Hockney (Petersburg Press, £5.50); and The Penguin Book of Zen Poetry edited and translated byvjucien :Stryk and Takashi Ikemoto (Allen Lane, £3.95); and twso anthologiesthe PEN New Poems 1977-78, edited by Gavin Ewart (Hutchinson, £4.95), and the Arts Council of Great Britain's New Poetry 3, edited by Alan Brownjohn and Maureen Duffy (Arts Council, £4 and £2.25, distributed by Carcanet Press). New Poetry 3 is particularly to be encouraged because it provides evidence of bw attractively unfashionable yet interesting an anthology c,an be, when its ditors are prepared simply to select the bter poems that come their way, without soliciting established poets to provide conributions. The Arts Council advertised And received about 10,000 poems in response, from which the present selection of 200 poems has been made.

Solzhenitsyn composed a lon. gish narrative poem in his head while he was serving 'his sentence of forced labour under Stalin. It is based on his owvn wvar experience with the Russian army, and in particular on the coincidence that his battery followed the same line of advance into' East Prus. *sia that Samsonov's Seco)nd Army followed wvith disastrous consequences in 1914. Samsonov's defeat is the theme of Solzhenitsyn's novel August 1914. It is hard to tell, fromRobert Conquest's transldtion of the nerrative poem as Prussian Nights, whether we should regard the poem as a footnote to the novel, or vice versa.
Ideally, of course, one would like to say that each is a vital and self-sustaining work of art. Solzhenitsyn is a man of courage and intelligence, ar.d his writing has the nobility of truth told no matter what [he consequences to the teller. Uinfortunately, good novels ind good poems are not achieved merely by the exercise of truth telling, and where August 1914 seems to me a passable sol't of novel, if rather badly constructed, Prussian Nights in this translation reads like no sort of poem at all. It is, in a wvord, doggerel. The first four lines are example enough:
Open up, you alien country!
Wide open let your gates 71e tVrotwn !
For, approac7ing, see how boldly Russia's battle-line rolls on I
The publisher prints the Russian text on facing pages, and I can only hope that those able
to consult this will not find in it the bathetic and incongruous sound of a bad hymn tune which seems to hum and drone throughout the wshole translation.
Auden said once that in translating tone wvas ail. If
Conquest has correctly ren-- dered the tone of Solzhenitsyn's verse then so much the worse for Solzhenitsyn's verse. The achievement of Michael Hamburger in his compendious one-man anthology Gernan Poetry 1910.1975, is that he catches so many and such various tones-from the inwardness and sensitivity of Rilke to the freexrang'ng knockabout comedy of Gunter Grass. Once more, the publisher provides the original texts on facing pages, and the result is a remarkable anthology-a complete introduction, to German poetry in tthis cenitury. No major poet is omitted, and many attractive minor figures ate included. Amongst the latter I was pleased to see Kurt Schwitters, whose delightful ""To Anna Bloom"" is just the sort of poem that usually does not get included in big anthologies. (I wish, though, that Hamburger had used Schwitters's owvn English translation of this.)
Selected Poerms of Lawrence Durrell, edited with an introduction by Alan Ross, provides a timely reminder that whatever Durrell's fame as a novelist and charm as a writer of books about Mediterranean Places it is principally as a poet that we ought to consider him. Some of his poems, indeed, do seem to come from .th-e part of h,is mind that writes the popular prosethese things, while pretty, do not 'have aMy great feeling of necessity abo.ut them. But Durrell at his best is more than an observer of exotic places. Ross has done him a real service by this selection, which is almost solidly the authentic thing. I refer to three poems as examples of Durrell's range and d-epth-"" To Ping-Ku, Asleep ""'
which is-- beautifully te,nder, ""Nemea "". which has an incantatory lyricism not far away from Rimbaud at his most magical, and ""A Ballad of the Good Lord Nelson "". The last could only have been written by Durrell. It is hard, bawdy, Witty, dashing, dashed-off, and brilliant. I wish he had written two dozen things like it, to the dismay of all the academics. First stanza only:
The Good Lord Nelson had a swollen gland,
L#ttle of the scripture did he understand
Till a woman led him to the promised land
Aboard the Victory, Victory 0.
Donald Davie's In the Stopping Train and Other Poems is interesting chiefly for its title. poem, in.which' Davie finds a' chattier. and more open-ended way of talking to himself. The verses otherwise seem to me the same tired and timid mixture as before, with no discern-
ible pressure of feeling behind' them. W. S. Graham is also a great talker-to-himself and his new collection Implements in Their 'Places contains many poems in which he keeps clear-' ing his throat or approaching the possibility of saying some-. thing. Graham's finest achievie-. ment to date seems to me his long poem Thee. Nightfishing '(1955). In' 'truth, he ;seems to have one subject only' ~and that

Jung once said: ""It is not Goethe that creates Faust, but Faust that creates Goethe."" ,W;at he meant is that there is ,a sease in which the poet is a spectator in the theatre of his o*n .imnagination.: The idea is not. -'.ne-7-it ' iis a modem 6bspre¢sion 'of Cone theory of Romanticism, "" ivhich in turn derives from Greek notions of rhe poet as possessed by a daimon. Why I mention it here is because if I had to nominate on-e living English poet whose work seems to fit into this category that poet wvould be Peter Redgrove, whose FrontK Every Clzitnk of the Ark and. Otlier New Poetrns (Routlea:ge & Keg'an - Pajl £4.95) is a book vhich~ f tvould find difficult. indeed,. to 'describe in any other': terms et alll. That is Redgrove's strengrir, and his limitati6n. On *the one hand, you sense- that you are in the presence of a miinjinspired, a man thilking and fe6ilm, in images, a mun whose wiork is the natural overflow ""f y.nconscious depths of creativity. On the other hand, there is'the suspicion that Redgrovc is at the mercy of his own psychology. His poems stream and sing and rage and bless. I wislh that they more often stood still. and told their truth quietly, as in the beginning lines of ""The Breathing-Place "":
Your picture in each fallintg
raindrop Your hair blowing as the rain
falls Your hair in the waters as they
unfold Your hair brushling me as you
read me Does not compensate. Touch me
thtere, lhe saus, At mp root, in tilat spot, mp
sadness.
I do not think, in saying this, that I am wishing Redgrove were another kind of poct. These lines are llot uncharactelistic of him. There Is tenderness in this book, as well as energy, and wvhen the two come together he writes with a sensitivity and an openness that remind me of Rilke. What he needs, perhaps, is a Faust or a Duino angel-I mean, some over-riding theme which wvill take hold of his prodigal imagination in such a way as to give it concentration. Yet this is to criticize rather sniffily *a volume of poems which is as fertile in invention, and as rich in verbal substance, as anYthing we are likely to see this year.
lain Crichton Smith is another poet possessed by the daimon. In his case. this does not mean the outpouring of poems which are repetitive in imagery, or dark anid difficult to follow, but it does mean that he tends to wvrite uncritically. His book In the Middle (Gollancz, £2.95) contains half a. dozen superb.. things, a -good de4I' . `ele that is interesting and wvhich no one but Crichton Smith could have written, and some stuff which should never have left his wastepaper basket. Crichton Smith's facility allors him to mnistake fanicies
It Changed My Life, by Betty Friedan (GOl'ancz, £5.95). No counting the number of lives changed by Betty Friedan's first book, in 1969, The Feminine Mlstique. From being an ordinary housewife and mother. (is there such a person ?) she found that hundreds of thousands of Vomen al!l over the world felt as trapped .mid dismayed as she did. Betty Friedan kept going, throigh interviews with
for the real thing-'witness two bad poems, one about a girl reading Milten at the . cash desk in the supermarket C""Pupil's Holiday job )% and .a trite pictu -postcard-.;pieco. called ""In Ireland "". SWhen Crichton Smith is in the grip of his dainton, however, his language changes for the better, and his images are never predictable, and the rhythm of the lines is at one with their sense:
TIhe owvl stands on the moor with
its ringed glasses itn the red lighlt that's painted on
the grolund. The rabbit cocks its ears on an
old mound and the ihens pick their skirts up
and go hoome. Yet even after that fresh nrSs, he goes and spoils -it with lhg moo*n casting ""its eerie light"" in the next stanza. He is a careless writer, but then he is so prolific that he can afford to be. At his best, he is authentic and inspilred, and he writes poems possessed by an impressive self-awvareness, and by an even more impressive awvareness of the self's linitations as a source of awareness. Again: a major con_entra-ting theme would perhaps
induce in him a poetry of: greater resonance then he -is achieving at present.
John Ashberv's Self-Portrait in a Convex MNiirror (Carcanet Press, £2.25) -is the most accomplished of the volumes I have under Treviev. Ashberv, again, is aln inspired poet, and the daimon has already achlieved in his work a remarkable individuality of tone. He lets his imagination go, but he never losers control of his language. Peter Ackroyd has described Ashbery's wor-k well: ""It continually presen,ts the language of feeling wivthout enacting it "". There are times when this leaves the readcr frustrated, as though the poet were fl,i;rting wvith a deliberate avoidanlce of meaniing. Bu t t;hen meaninglessness is not hard to ach:eve, and Ashbery-even at his most opaque-succeeds in wvriting lines of unusual memorability. lt is as if he says: ""Wheat this means is that I make you remember it "". And the saying works. I recomnmend Ashbery's difficult and teasing and often very beautiful and funiiy p-oetry to readers who have not yet made its acquaintance. The nearest thing I know to it in Engligh-to define its peculiar flavour-is the prose of Ronald Firbank. Li.ke Firbank, too, he is a much tougher and a rather m*ore serious wvriter than you'd think at first glance.
Books in privately printed editions are generally awful, but Harry Kemp's Poe7ns in Variety (obtainable from the author at Old Hall, High Nibthwaite, near Ulverston, Cumbria, £3) is an exception. Kemp's wrork is classic and austere. He keeps his daimon on a tight rein, and lets it out for little epigrammatic trots. 'But there is a ..rea1. pressite. of
lived experience behind the lines, and some dn.teresti.ngly complicated feelings get expressed with simplicity.

Ted Hughes, narrative poem Gaudete started life as a film scenario, and I think that if Hammer Films were still in the blood business they would snap it up immediately, with Christopher (Dracula) Lee an obviQus choice for the star part. It concerns the Rev Nicholas Lumb. a priest abducted by spirits inlto another world and replaced by a changeling who (as the Argument says) ""interprets the role of minister in his own way "". What this means is explained on page 113-Mr Lumb has (t new religion. IHe is starting Christianity all over again, right from the start. IHe has persuaded all the women in the parish. /Only woman can belong to it. IThey are all in it and he makes love to them all, all the tine. The broken-backed rhythm of rhe lines quoted might be justified by the fact that they are supposed to he the story, told "" through sobs and tremblings "", beaten out of one of the women by her husband (Evans' first blow crushes her- lip . . .). Whether the hysteria of the rest can be justified by the misadventures that befall the Rev Lumb in a slaughterhouse in the prologue I cannot say, but I fee' sure this experience (Half a ton of guts. -Balloon out and drop on to Lumb. /He fights in the roping hot mass) cannot be claimed to have helped his nature or the versification. After our ""goateved vicar"" has fornicated with his female parishioners, mostly outdoors, he is shot and his body is burned in the church basement. A mysterious stranger then appears on the West Coast of Ireland, whistles up an otter, and leaves a tattered notebook full of verse for three little girls to take to their priest. These verses, touching on guilt and remorse, seem to me preferable to what has preceeded them, and observably better-written. Indeed, I would suggest that only the last 24 pages of the book deserve to be considered as poetry at all. So considered, here is a note of tenderness and regret which is new in Mr Hughes' work, and not unwelcome:
Looking Tor her form I find only a fern.
Where she should be waiting. in
the flesh
Stands a scarnore with weeping
letters.
It is a relief to turn from these nightmares to the wellcrafted and decent work in
Dannie Abse's Collected Poems 1948-1976. In a prefatory note, Dr Abse tells us that his arnbition has been to write poems which appear translucent but are in fact deceptions. ""I would have a reader enter them, be deceived he could see through them like sea-water, and be puzzled when he cannot quite touch bottom."" That defines my own experience of this book, and the interesting thing is perhaps that where Dr Abse seems most personal and occasional, writing out of some small piece of immediate experience, making a poem that is like a story told in verse, there his work begins to be possessed of that not-quitefathomable quality wvhich other poets have more deliberately or directly sought. I am thinking of poems like Uncle Isidore. Portrait of the Artist as a Middle-aged Man, and Peachstone:
For that night Ihis wife brought
him a peacl,
his favourite fruit, whlile the sick
light glowed, and his slack, dry mouth sucked,
sucked, sucked, with dping epes closed-perhaps
for her saketill bright as blood the peachstone
showed. The heartening thing about the book is that poems as good as this grow in frequency as Dr Abse progresses. He has learned with the years where to find the extraordinarv in the everyday, and how to celebrate it without straining his throat muscles.
The Oval Portrait belongs to a different tradition, and one that still commands respect when practised by a poet as gifted as Kathleen Raine. This is poetry as high song, mystery, occult wisdom, and if the note is sometimes thin nevertheless Miss Raine's sincerity and purity of utterance are never in doubt. At the other extreme, the poems in Anne Sexton's 45 Mercy Street impress wvith their grim if playful realism. Mrs Sexton had one subjecther own death-wish. These verses, or chants, the last she composed before her suicide in 1974, are like the nursery rhymes of the child deep in all of us, that child still afraid of the dark but longing for it also.
I recommend James Merrill's Divine Comedies for its narrative poem The Book of Ephraim, the strangest and deepest thing Mr Merrill has given us. He is a poet of the kind once called couth by the New Yorker : that is, a poet on whom you can rely for order, and form, and good sense. Here he employs his reasonable skills to explore areas of shady unreason, and the result is something like Yeats' book A Vision as it would have been if written in racy workmanlike verse by a sceptical Robert Browning who only believed a half of what the spirits hrd to tell him.

The Winter's Task, by Robert Wells .(Carcanet Press, £2)
Collected Early Poems of Ezra Pound, edited by Michael John King (Faber, £12)
Collected Poems in English and French, by Samuel Beckett (John Calder, £4.50)
The Oxford Book of Welsh Verse in English, chosen by Gwsyn Jones (Oxford, £3.95)
The Penguin Book of American Verse, edited by Geoffrey Moore (Penguin, £1.75)
Robert Wells, at 30, and with a single book, The Winter's Task, seenis to mle to establish himself as one of the best young poets now writing. le writes poems that are plain and unpretentious,. poems firmly in the English tradition, poems devoid of ambiguity. or dislocation of syntax. Reading him is first of all a pleasure because you find yourself in a landscape you seem to recognize. Then it is a surprise and an instruction because that landscape is not quite as it wyas in Hardy, say, or in Edward Thomas. Something is different, the mental weather has changed, some freshness in the seeing has been matched by a newvness in thC saying, with a result that we seem to be looking at familiar fields. grown suddenly foreign and full of mystery. I will not say "" niagic "", since Mr Wells is not at all a sloppy poet. If anything, I should suppose that his critical -masters are Yvor Winters, wvith his insistence that a poemn should be a memorable and intelligible statement, and T. E. liulme,
aith his wish for ""accurate, precise and definite description "", and a poetry that is ""dry atld sophisticated "". Life and poetty have a nice way of being more various than even the most reliable theorists allowv, however, and so we have Ir Wells, Writing two sttntas in regulat mtntte on a conventional theme, ""After Haymaking"", and coming up with the following:
The last bale ptoced, he stretched
* out in the hay. Its wam nth and his were one.
He watched the fields beneath the
* oweakening daW And felt his skin still burniifg
with the sun. WVhen it was dusk, he moved.
t between his skin And clothes the sweat rdn cold.
He trembled as he felt the air
begin To touch add touch for wvhat it
could not hold. No unexpected happening, no flashy images,. not a single departure from the word'order of common speech, yet in the peculiar. sensuousnesss of the vhole, enibodied in that repeated touch, the poem comies alive and is like no one else's poem. A poet who can use the word arnd to such effect that you can almost feel it (as Mr Wells does here, in his last line) is someone to be reckoned with. The book contains a dozen things as good, includitig the
impressive title poem. Here is an authentic new voice.
It must have been harder to distinguish the authenticity in the first six books by Ezra Pound, published between 1908 and 1912, because they contain so many voices, or echoes of
other people's voices. Swin-- burne, Do4wson, Browning, Whitman, not to speak of Villon and Pound's beloved ProvenBal and Italian troubadours, all seem to put in their strophes. When he came to make his own definitive selection for the "" Personae "" volume of 1926, Pound rejected 99 of these early poems, and when his daughter eventually persuaded him to republish some of them in 1965 he introduced that book as ""a collection of stale creampuffs "". What is the point, then, of Collected Early Poems of Ezra Pound ? Well, in the first place it is a marvrellous job of editing, putting together not just the contents of all those early books but a great number of previously uncollecttd ponems from periodicals, and assembling them beautifully in a volume which is a bibliophile's delight, containing reproductions of ill the original titlepages ind copious and careful notes on every textual variation. It the second place, it is ani eloquent testament to Pound's innocence and to his sense of vocation-there ig somtething noble about these verses, even where they are most brash and grate On the nerves wvith their Wardout Stteet misconceptions of the English language- But, above all, in the thitd and most important place, this book sets ""Hugh Selwyn Mauberley "" and
The Cantos"" in context, shotwing what Pound had to overcome, not just in the way of Victorian influences hbLt in his own termperatlent. Here is a modetn poet strutggling to be born.
Samuel Beckett's Collected Poems itt Englislh and French is the work of an unmistakable modern who wvas never qUite born as a poet until he found himself in prose. Stuch a piece as ""tWhoroscope"" (winner of the Nancy Cutard £10 Competition for the best poem on the subject of Time In the Sumnimer of 19301) is now unreadable exceitt as a joke. tut it is a brilliant and spiky and serious joke, full of the touches later developed into a whole game of verbal tennis in the novels. Apart from such foreshadowings, toecketts finest verses are in French, amoong them the outstanding
je voudrais que mon anour meure qtt'il p?euve Sur Ie cimetidee et les ruelles ouz je vais
pleuruht cClle qui crta m'ainzer
Foul lines as bitter and beautiful as anything he has written.
finally, two anthologies. The Oxford Book of Welsh Verse in Etzglish, chosen by Gwyn Jones, ranges from the bardic Aneirin and Taliesin to the hardly less bardic Dylan Thomas, but finds toomw for the quieter mherits of Dafydd ap Gwilym and Edward Thornas as well, Altogether, there are 238 poemes, more than half of them translated from the Welsh language, The Pengui Book of American Verse, editedt by Geoffrey Moore, statt witll Anne Bradstreet and euds with a number of versifiers Who ate miserly with punctuation and very free with anti-White tacial sentiments. Its most serious emhission is Laura Riding: arguably the most gifted and inportant American poet of the twentieth century, and completely ignored bere. Miss Riding's dislike of 'antholo, gies is well'known, but Mr Moore gives no evidence of having even asked her.. At only £1.75 for 656 paRgs the book repreaenxs value of a kind.

"Nye, Robert",Poetry,The Times,1976-Dec-09,"London, England","*_Poeti'y
Swift said England was never able to boast more than three poets at a time-Our chilling climate hardly bears A sprig of bays in fifty years. That is not an opinion which will do for a regular reviewer of new verse but I find myself agreeing with it in an absolute sense rather more than a reviewer should. There are never as many poets as there seem to be. For that' reason I have used this column in the past with some sceptiiism, trying to describe what our contemporaries are doing, and making a guess as' to its worth, but not crowvding each paragraph with poeticules and Poetasters. I don't intend to change the general pattern now, but this paMticular pre-Christmias round-up will include more names and more books than usual,'in an attempt to provide something of a list from which anyone can take an item or tVo wvith confidence that they will make acceptable gifts.
T-he fi*st bookt needs' no apology-except from me, for not drawing attention to it sooner. It is Padraic /Vallon's Poems (Doiman 'Press, f3).' Fallon was an unfashionable and authentic poet, who died two years ago, having waited a lifetime to publish this-hiis first ind final collection. Attempts have been made to fix him in a rural tradition, but while the imagery of these poems is often drawn from the presences of the Irish country-. side, the mind at large within them is modern and unpredictable, and their rhythms have an authority which seems to me to'come from a congruent attention to form and to the truthfulness of the thing said:
No soeet mouth but cormces to tiis, God, Attis too for all that Great
Goddess And heavenly stuff:
'Much is-man and not enough.
'He is talking about death. A
sense of ithe muchness of man being not enough, and persistent energy in tt-ying to sav what else there might be, with outLsacrificing poetry for certainty, makes this moTe than just a collectioh of fine indi-i dual 'poems. Fallodn is mythhaunted and truth-possessed, a eomplete poet and I won't be 'surprised if 1further- reading confirms ny impressionr that he was the best Irish poet since -Yeats. "" '
No one yet has: had a chance to neglect 'or ignore the work in Teen English Poets (Carcanet Press, £2), for this anthology introduces people not previously published except in periodicals. The poets: are Robert Wells, Neil 'Powell, .Gareth: Reeves, Alistair Elliot, Grevel Lindop, Michael Vince; Xeith Chandler, Clive Wilmer, William Bedford, and Charles Boyle. What they ,have in common is a' lack of glamour, 'ind man interest in getting the poem ""jright"" however awkward the results -may sound. In the more successful poems, of.course, the craft and the truth are at one, and Robert Wells strikes mesas already outstanding it this stage, since none
of his 12 podms in this book is much below the level-Dof-that *-marriage.. Carcanet plan to publish a full-length. book by him, and by. several of the others. Meanwhile, this book allows a little hope for the future.
David Wright's To the Gods the Shades (Carcanet, £3.90) consists of new and collected poems by' a writer whose, wsork *encoqipasses an unusual variety of moods and themes. That . makes. Wright sound .facile,
however, . Which he is notalthough I must admit that his overtly romantic and rhetorical pieces leave me cold, and the YWright- I respect is the one without the singing robes. At his best he constructs a hard and clear and memorable verse, with an implication of music in the back of its mind.
Kevin .Crossley.Holland finds poems in indefinite occasions, moments of doubt and hesitation, and does not let himself *go, emotionally or intellectually, although there is both intelligence and a considerable lyrical sensitivity in the way his poems. are made. The ti^le'piece of The
Dream House (Andra Deutsch,. £L.95) is interesting-a sort of dream poem, using halfrhymes and .a refrain of "".John, John, John"" which sounds as though it comes out of a nursery rhyme; only it is barer and. colder than any -nursery rhyme, for this poem is about a wake. Partly about a wakes I should say, for I think. this . ""dream-house"" is the place, where Crossley-Holland's talent resides, and he should visit it more often. With Patricia Beer he - has- also recently edited the second Arts Council anthology New Poetry 2 (Arts Council, £3.80 and £E2).
Waking the Dead - (Gollancz, £2.S5) -shows Alasdair Maclean still- deepening and developing the poetic concernsv which made Fromt the .Vilderness (1973) such a heartening first book: These are poems about - deathhe poet's -mother died while his first . collection was at the printers-but he protests.again that they are "" also fictions ""! What he means is .that he is not- in the True Confessions business, and a good thing too. This is a fine book, and in one poem, "" Explaining Death ;to a Child "", Maclean transcends anythlng he has achieved so far, and has -witten something which deserves to pass.straight into the anthologies.. -
Just room left to recommend Peter Bland's Mr Maui (London Magazine Editions, £2.75), lwich contains the best of his New Zealand poems, as well as a selection of work written since his return to England; Stanley Cook's admirably plain statements in Alphabet (Harry . Chambers/Peterloo Poets,. 90p)

I The Little Maeazines
A Sttdy of Six Editors
Bv Ian Hamilton
(Weidenfeld & Nicolsot, £4.95) ""A Milton might be living in Chicago today and be unable to find an outlet for his verse "", wrote an: indignanit Harriet Monroe 'in 1912;' and shortly afteri4ards she took steps to remedy the situation by found.. ing Poetry, one of' the subjects of this witty/ extremelyv readable but all-too-brief survey of ""the milost exemplary and memorable"" of this century's little magazines. Like her fellow-Chicagoan Margaret Anderson, who founded The Little Review two years later, Harriet Monroe was one of those - admirably missionary individuals without whom feiv little inagazines would stagger off the ground, .and but for wvhom literature itself would be very much the poorer; and one of those editors who may lack original talent themselves ("" In 'lazy laughing Pinama-/O flutter of ribbon betwixt the seas "") but are driven by a combination of literary idealism and indignation over the exdlusiveness or timidity of established publishers 'and periodicals. As' a glance at the acknowledgements page of almost any. collection of poems or short stories will confirm, little magazines are invaluable for established writers as well as ""for the untried and the experimental. The best of them are essdntially- one''man bands, reflecting the taste and the. stayihg poxiWer of the found:ing editor, 'and Ian Hamilton' reckons that even these begin to flounder or fade after a
decade or so. Yet despite modest life expectancies, equally modest circulations (T. S. Eliot's The Criterio71 averaged 400 copies an issue) and shoe-string finances, the little magazines can justifiably pride themselves on backing unknown horses and ventilating unfashionable points of view, and it is there that their enormous value lies.
As the founding editor of The New Review-and, unlike Miss Motroe, an extremely impressive poet in his own right-lan Hamilton is in the perfect posiw tion to introduce us to this colourful, feud-ridden vanguard of the literary life. His six essays on his chosen magazines -The Little Review, Poetry,4 The Criterion, Partisan Review, Geoffrey Grigson's New Verse and Cyril Connolly's Horizonare as entertaining and perceptive as might be expected. It is something of a revelation to realize what a blunt instrument the redoubtable Geoffrey Grigson wielded in New Verse, the magazine which did so much to establish Auden's reputationi (C. Day Lewis was, anathematized at one stage as ""grease in the sink-pipe of letters""); and he reminds us once again of, the dubious resonances of T. S. Eliot's advocacy. of an "" aristocracy of culture-"". Given the rather random, discontinuous nature of the book .as a whole, one cannot help wishing that he had thrpwn his net a good deal wider, and put his editors and their magazines in a broader perspective: but-even *the most indomitable researcher might well 'decide to call it a .day ,when faced with yet a,nothir mountain of ye]lowing back-numbers (Scrutiny? Pcn.otiin New Writing? The London Merc'urp, even ?).
* /
Despite its tantalizing brevity, The Little Magazines is replete with sardonic observations and pleasing anecdotes, the best of which concern the two ladies from Chicago-possibly because they shared an amiable weakness for the banal or the frauduleiit, particularly after they had shaken off the cdrrective influence of Ezra Pound. Ever active on behalf of those he admired, Pound persuaded a slightly bemused Margaret Anderson-whose original idol was John Galsworthy-to publish Eliot, Yeats and several episodes from Ulysses (as a result of which The Little Review was several times burned by the authorities, and Miss Anderson and her' coeditor put on trial) ; after his resignation as foreign editor, The Little Review discerned genius in the unpiromising form of Baroness' Else von Freytag Loringhoven, a frenziedly inarticulate poetess with a yellowed face, blackened lips, a cancelled postage . stamp attached to her cheek and a coal-scuttle lashed on her head like a helmet. And Pound finally broke with Harriet Monroe after her growing enthusiasm for a. wholesome, allAmerican type of poetry had led her to extol such oddities as Lew Sarett, a specialist in Red Indian rhythms (""Ho 1/ Hi ! Plenty-big talk !/Ho.! Ho! Ho ! ""). But for all their occasional absurdities, niagazines like these performed-and continue to perform-an invaluable function by making it possible' for future Miltons to see. the. light; .and that's what the little magaiines' are ultimately all about.

""Ezra is a- crowd, a little crowvd "". as. Wyndaham Lewis said. He certainly wrote like one. Here. for the first timne in one volume, are all The Cantos (Faber, £8.50 and E4.95), including the drafts and fragments of the final years. What a strange rich harvest, what a treasure-trove of jewvels and junk, wvhat a chapter of seachanges ! Talking of the sea, howv often The Cantos returnl to it, are full of it, with the surge and thunder of ain odyssey. The beginning, of course. is as good a start as any voyage ever made:
And thetn went down to the sh1ip. Set keel to breakers. forthi tni the
godly seal. and
IVe set Up must and sail on that
swvart ship....
Some of the landfalls are less happy. I think I see the need for Sigismundo Malatesta, and for most of the Chinese history, and even for John Adams-but there are great sagging wads and lumbers of cantos, round about the middle, vherle PouInd's inspiration seems to have gone dead, and he uses extracts from the nearest book tto l}and to get the thing moving again. Shakespeare did no less, you could say. and we bave to read the result, not the process. Perhaps the trouble, then, is that Pound insists so often on our becoming part of the process, vith his endless introduction of themes wvhich are then broken off, vith all those setitences that hang unfinished. vith the sheer impatience of his craft ? In the middle of the little crowd was there just a little emptiness ? After the bluster and chatter, in the moments of stillness, mostly vhat you catch is an echoTudor indeed is gone and everv rose (Pound), Iramn indeed 'Ls gone with all its Rose (Edward Fitzgerald). . . . But when that has been said, and when the defects of The Cantos have been referred to the circumstances of their writing, and when Pound's owvn quiet anguish in the last fragmentary cantos has been quoted against him (I ant tlot a demitgod, I carnot make it cohere), then we are still left wvith the most various and extraordinarv bodv of verse produced in English in this century. And "" body
is an inadequate figur e for it. Back to the little crowd. or to something Christine Brook-Rose once said, about Pound's method in The Cantos resembling a wvhirling spiral. That whirling spiral has its own still centre too, in the lines *vritten in the prison cage at Pisa:
Pull down thy vanity, it is not
man iMade courage, or madc order.
or made grace. Pull down thy vanity, I sazy
pull down Leman of thze green world hatrt
can be thy place .... There are not manv living poets wvho can be mentioned in the next breath after that. but I think that C. H. Sisson is one of themn. Readers of his In the Trojanz Ditch (1974) will be awvare that it consists not only
of collected poems, but of selected translations. Mr Sisson's versions of Catullus, in particular, seem to me extraordinarilv well-achieved. In The Poem on Nature (Carcanet Press, £3.90) it is of course Lucretius's De Rerum Natura which has engaged his attention. Now Lucretius is rather harder than Catullus whlen it comes to pleasing modern ears. but Landor and Dryden are there to remind us how important he is, and howv he spoke to them, and indeed in this version Lucretius speaks for himself in good plain English:
Nobody understands what the
soul is like. Is it there with tihe foetus or does
it slip in wit71 the midwife ? Does it die wzhen we do or break
itself up in t7te ce'neteri- ? Or is there some dusk-v region
to which it mtust go ? Or is it sent to inhabit othelr
cattle ? I admit titat part of mv pleasure in this is thlat it soundc so much like Mr Sisson's own mind at work. If you have little Latin. you -will find this a nice wvay of becoming acquainted wvith Lucretius, just because of its vigoui and energv as a
piece of English vexrse. But 1- suspect that classical scholars will not be displeased either, althouglh they may be dismayed. Inhabit other cattle? That is not the phrase of a mediocre translator. The wvhole is cool and lowv-keyed, but spiked here and there witlh a sharp note to remind us that our translator. fox- all his efforts, is scarcely invisible.
The currenii issue of Poetry Nation. numbel- 5. edited by C. B. Cox and Michael Schmidt (Carcanet Press. £2.50). is chiefly notable for nine nesv original poems by Mr Sissoui. and fox- a set of epigramn3atic Divinie Poems, the first of which I quote for its intrinsic merit and because of its relevance to the Lucretius above: llWork- without hope is the best
recipe
For a hiarmiless life, if any Itfe
can be harinless
That is bornt of wvomizan and goes
back into the slot.
There was one. harnxless. who
cante that wap.
I hope that those who have not yet noticed wrill soon start noticing for themselves that it is rather a long time since wve have had a poet who can accommodate within his verse a reference to Christ as shockingly orthodox and sotto voce as the fourth line there.
Ted Hughes' Season Songs (Faber, £2.40) seems intended for children in the first place, but older readers will note that it continues that awful process of Disneyfication w*hich began in Cr'ow. WSVhen Mr Hughes Twrites of a swallow, foix example
The swvallow of suimmnxer. tVe
searmstress of sunmmxer.
Site scissors the blue into shapes

I can't really see or hear anythinlg of the bird at all. What I can see is Mr Hughes reducing Swvinburne to a fashionable cartoon. wvhile almost parodving his ownsv penchlanzt fox- projecting an agitation of spirit onto the natural world.

Edited b Robert Nve
."" ' , ', '''.
(Faber £4.95 and £2.25)
Sonetto""- a -ittle tune, a -sing.song sound, -a.sigh,
a sonnet. Even' in -Petrarch's tongue the - word.. carried, a diminutive, faintly. patronizing overttone. It is certainly true in. modern.English,.. where: ""sonnet"" whiffs of school magazines, crushes .' and pashes and poetry. 'medals, Shakespeare exams add somebody's rhyXmingdictionary,. smart thank-you letters and supper
parties at' Leigh Hunt's, and gilt-enmbossed' diaries lying on the. candlewick.'bedspread'at quarter.to-twelve. Indeed sonneteers- as ""a specios, :have always been mildly ridiculous: "" I am IMelancholie. myself, divers 'times, Sir and then do I no more but take pen and paper presently, 'and overflow you- half a score, or a dozen of- s6nnets at a sitting "", as a po1e ica] gentleman explains 'in one of, Ben Jonson's ""Humour' -plays. One knows the type.
Yet the fatt is that since its mysterious invention by a Sicilian secretary' of state' in the mid.thfrteenth.. century (the Mafia' ele'ment. seems -oddly- appropriate to. such- an intricate device), the sonnet has remained -the mostinsidiously -universal of stict lyric forms in Europe for- six' centries, and it is impossible to imagine our literar'y heritage without 'its masterworks-say, -Ronsard's "" Scnnets- . pur Helene"" (1578.);. . Luis ' Cam6es! ""Rimas""
(1595);- Donne's ""Holy Sonnets "" (c. 1610) ; - Nerval's ""Chimeres"" (1853) ; -or Rilke's ""Die* Sonette an OrDheus"" (1923).
As far as the specifically English tradition is concerned, the position is even* more striking. One can say quite simply that-with one or two notable, and intriguing, exceptions-the entire history of English poetry from Wyatt to Auden, can be told through its sonnets. They lie there like a trail of small, glistening stepping-stones, across the whole great flood. It is for this reason that The Faber Book of Sonnets will, in my view, become a classic among anthologies,.
Once the scale of the idea is grasped, it is an obvious one-beautifully so. The selectidn by Robert Nye is almost- equally obvious and excellent; and the result is magic. One reads straight through, greeting old friends, and then begins to slip back afd forth between the cen!turies, gradually picking up more and richer echoes, answerings, ironies between 100 voices and 400 poems: the same ceremoniously repeated shape on the page, the clamorous variety of whispers in the ear:
Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
Church bells, beyond the stars heard, the soul's
blood . .
Stones ring; like each tucked string tells, each hung
bell's .... What passing-bells for those whlo die as cattle ....
And clank the bell-chain for St Gertrude's
choir ....
(Don't you recognize those voices ?)
The most extraordinarily vivid picturesound pioture-of the development of the English poetic idiom emerges. One hears the changing of the speech rhythms; the shifting influences from Italy, France, Aimerica; and -the steady expanding, often darkening, of the subject matter. One catches that most subtle of all evolutions, the change in the English tone of voice when confronting the eternal and unchanging questions: falling in and out of something called Love; pondering on fame, or failure; glorying in aztion, mortifying in war; remembering childhood; celebrating friends, facing solitude, facing death, facing beyond death. The little sonetto, carries them all.
The model sonnet is of course the Petrarchan, ""a rhyming series of sighs associated with neoPlatonic worship of an infaccessible Muse"", as Robert Nye so neatly puts it. There are only
five. rhyine.aonds, ndthe po'em 'breaks' and:' 'retrcats& like. a wave..after.thi.octave; flt th,e. English s*'niet has always be'epi characteriizer

Looking o'ver the . collection, one has the impression. of four great and distinctive epochs: ' the Elizabethan.Jacobean, the Romantic; the Pre-Raphaelite, and the Modernist-and this itself provides an interest-' ing critical viewspoint.. -'
Robert Nye's choice -in the tirst two ""epochs!"" seem,s to me impeccable. The third epoch is perhaps a fraction less sure. His main voices are Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Christina and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, together with Hopkins and Hardy. But one feels a loss of centrality, a slight willfullness of choice, Hartley Coleridge (1796-1849). .and the mad Harvard mystic Jones Very (1813-1880) are both given eight sonnets (the same as Wyatt); while Meredith's powerful and tormerfted poems from ""Modern Love"" (1862) find no place, and Browning and Tennyson are only granted two appearances each. The critical estimate of this period is certaihlv changing faster than any other, but I find
this a little fustv.
But it does not rcally matter. Mr Nye's handling of the fourth epoch makes up fnr everything. This is where the "" classic"" quality of the anthology might seriously have faltered. but his gaelic spy-point from thie spires of the National Library at Edinburgh, serves him in good stead, and his choice is calm, penetrating, and basically just. Representative single sonnets are used to mark out the modern course with. out smartness or embarrassment-Rupert Brooke, Owen, 'Graves, MacDiarmid, Dylan Thomas, Roy Campbell, ee cummings, Lowell. Berrymnan, Larkin and so on. But just enough emphasis is given to the ivonderful sonnets of Pound (perversely and beautifully returning to GSuido Cavalcanti), Robert Frost, W.H. Auden and Patrick Kavanagh (again brave, but probably right) to suggest the strong and distinctive development of the ""Modernist"" fornL If there is a tendency towards Celts and Gaels and New Englarnd men, it does nothing to lessen the quality of the poetry-on the contrary; and this too is part of the story. Altogether it is an outstanding bit of editing and a very remarkable book A pity perhaps that Robert .Nve did not grant himself one sonnet, by way of envoi for the long marvellous journey ahead.

Exorcizing the witch of Amherst
The Life of Emily Dickinson
The Complete Poems of Emily Dickinson
By Richard B. Sewall
(Faber, two volumes, £17.50)
Edited by Thomson H. Johnson (Faber, £3.95)
Emily Elizabeth Dickinson (1830-1886) chose to stay at home in an ambitious and Protean age, but from behind the half-open upstairs door in Amherst, Massachusetts, she too aspired to glory:
To pile like thunder to its close Then crumble grand awan
WhiZe Everything created hid This would be Poetry-
Or Love-the two coeval comeWe both and neither prove-
Experience either and consumeFor None see God and live-
'oetry and Love; GSod and fire and death: throughout her eatraordinarily unsung career -only seven of her 1,775 poems were published in her lifetime-she alchemised the essence of experience in so many lines as terse as these that we think we have her measure. So it takes a brave man at the start of a biography of 800 pages, to admit not only that his book is undefinitive, but that the whole truth about Emily Dickdnson will never be known: ""She seemns almost wilfully to have seen to that"", he reminds us again, on page 668:
Tlhe family, the early friends and the later, the mentors and the masters. the lovers or wvould-be lovers or fantasy lovers-each yietds its modicum of meaning. I2n our present state of knowledge, however, no more than that can be claimed for an?
of them. There is a feeling of incompleteness, of areas still to be explored, of mysteries that still beckon. The aim must be to shore up what truth we have as firmly as possible in the never-ending dialectics of readings and counter-readings. . .
I quote this passage at length because it exemplifies Richard B. Sewall's sensitivity and fair-mindedness, while summarising the range and resonance of his book. The Lile of Emily Dickinson is magnificent, the best biography I have read in the past 12 months, and the best literary biography since Richard Holmes's Shelle,y: the Pursuit two years ago: like Holmes, Sewall makes sure that the poems themselves are never fae from the heart of the narrative argunment.
Although Emily Dickinson covered her lifetracks with a coquettish thoroughness at times, the poems themselves thrust ever deeper into our 20th century earth and there are few writers in whom life and art breathed so nearly as one. By using a great scholar's gifts of patience, synthesis anid understanding to illuminate her life, Professor Sewall has amplified her literary achievement.
He is calm, but committed, believing that over the next decade, Dickinson will joiii Whitman as America's "" seminal poet "", and that the implications of her life and work are inexhaustible. Time will take care of the oracle, but the inexhaustibility both Sewall's Life and the Complete Poems prove beyond doubt. Hardly a page of the Poems can be opened without the disturbance of riddle, ellipsis and paradox or the shock of plain words-chain, plank, red, song, stars, East, fly and bee-working as never before. And the letters, first collected three years after the Poems, in 1958, and quoted liberally through the Life, are scarcely less remarkable, in many cases an uninterrupted continuation of the poems.
IVe were waked bu tize ticking of the bells-the bells tick in Anzherst for a fire, to tell the firemen I sprang to thze window, and each side of the curtain saw that awful sun. The moon was shining hizgh at the time, and the birds singing like trutmpets.
Vinnie came soft as a moccasin, "" Don't be afraid, Emily, it is only the fouzrth of July "" (1879)
Onlv the wind saved the house. Edward Dickinson, Congregationalist and College pillar of Amherst, last of the' Connecticut Valley
""River Gods"", had died of exhaustion in 1874 -Emily was devastated-and his widow was bedridden by the time of the fire. Vinnie was the younger sister, giddy once, but later the ferocious protector of Emily's total withdrawal from society and of her poems after death. Vinnie was heroic, yet it was Austin, their brilliant brother, who shared Emily's imagination most closely and with Emily's warm encouragement-she was deeply attached to both -Austin had married the ambitious Susan Gilbert in 1856. The Dickinsons lived at The Homestead; Austin and Sue settled next door, at The Evergreens, and the marriage proved bloody and bitter. When Mabel Loomis Todd arrived in Amherst with her astronomer husband in 1881, she and Austin fell passionately in love (some heartrending unpublished letters here) and "" The War Between the Houses ""5
smouldeiing for years, blazed into the open:
How red the fire rocks below....""
These are tche people and this is the story that Sewall tells with such subtlety in Volume One. It reads like a terrible new tale of frustration from the worlds of Chekhov and Edith Wharton; it is violent with the slumbering terrors of O'Neill. And of Emily Dickinson, for Sewall succeeds marvellously in reflecting these emotional tragedies in the mirror of Emily's intelligence and making clear once and for all that here in Amherst, in The Homestead and The Evergreens, was real world enough for the poems:
She dealt her pretty words like BladesHow glittering they shone-
And every One unbared a NerveOr wanto ned witl a Bone-
So much for Sue. Emily missed nothing.
"" iMy friends are my estate "", the Queen Recluse once declared, and Volume Two, foliowing a loosely chronological pattern, shows Emily reflected in the friends and relatives with whom she corresponded, mixing poems, jokes and letters, throughout her life: first loves, dear cousins, and huge influences like judge Lord, the great preacher Charles Wadsworth and Samuel Bowiles, editor of the Sprinzgfield Republican, with whom she fell in love. The convivial Bowles was totally unsuited to her-older, manied, worldly, insensitive to her revolutionary language-but she worshipped him, and he is the most likely intended recipient of the desperate letters addressed ""Master"" and mercifully never sent, during a long period of breakdown around 1860.
Popular legend turned Emily Dickinson into a white witch and pert versifier, ethereally letting dowvn buns from her bedroom window to the small children of Amherst. Professor Sewall has exorcized the witch and the versifier and reconstructed an amazing sensibility which took its incandescence not just from the Bible, Shakespeare and the seventeenth century Metaphysical poets but from the Pturitan tradition of self-reliance in the hills around her and, most of all, from the hard and bitterly humorous world at the bottom of the stairs and

George Barker reminds me now of the priest who, asked what he did in the French Revolution, replied "" I survived "". Barker goes on surviving. His kind of ruffian romanticism, briefly in favour in the 40s, has hardly been popular since. His new book Dialogues etc (Faber paperback, £1.95) has been made the Spring choice of the Poetry Book Society, which is sensible, if surprising. Sensible because Barker, at 63, continues to write lines and sometimes whole poems that impress themselves upon the memory by reason of that quality of in2evitability which his best work has always possessed. Surprising because Barker is still the Wild Man among contemporary English poets, the word-besotted punster, the perpetrator of appalling rhymes. Who else would dare link Apocalypse wvith umpteen tits in the same stanza? It is as though Byron had been set the purgatorial task of rewriting the poems and prophecies of William Blake.
The eight ""dialogues"" of Goag and Magog which run through the present book seem to me less interesting than the ""1 etc"" which surrounds them. In the dialogues there is an element of the factitious. Thev are literary ballads and jigs, and their tum-ti-tum rhythms provide the poet with an excuse for saying nothing much in a rather flashy wav:
All thut you have inside your hairy chest,"" he said.
is that old cuckoo clock and it ticktocks until vou're dead.""
Barker has written well in ballad form, but nowadavs he does better without it. In among the ""etc"" are sardonic statements about the distance between love and its physical and verbal expression, some fine celebrations of Italy (where the poet recently lived for seven years), and a handful of those odd, nagging, largely imageless poems which represent Barker at his most inspired. It is as though this poet had a second voice. When the voice takes over, the bdd puns and the strutting rhythms fall awvav and he wvrites with extraordinary quietness:
How can I see them ? Part of
them is me.
Thep will not anstwer when I ask
their nanes.
Sometimes I do not knowv if they
are even here
Wlhen I perceive them. I am1 their
k;nowvledge of
Their own identity, because the
purpose
Of mtn half existence is to elicit
theirs.
They beg for love. I also beg.
For themt.
That is a wvhole poemr, and the one with which the present volume concludes. Who are ""they""? The Muses, perhaps; the mysteries; unwritten poems, or inspil-ers of poems on a level wvith Rilke's angels. It is a measure of George Barker's success as a poet that it ranges from such intimations of the numinous to the bawdy bril-
liance of The True Conjession (1950). He has never surpassed the last named, in its particular line, and it may be the one vork by wihich he will be kno.wna by posterity. That is posterity s problem.
Pat-ic Dickinson's The Bearing Beast (Chatto & Windus paperback, £2.25) shcwvs that he is nowv at t,;e height of his powers, matter of an epigrammatic wvit wvhich previous volumes had adumbrated but never quite accomplished. He is a cool poet, a gentle poet, the sort that james Reeves had in mind *lhetn he celebrated one whose wvork had ""no Celtic bombast "". buit wvas inspired bv an `u tn presunming Saxon grace"". Tha-t Saxo;i grace brealks its owin bounds inl the final poem of the book. ""A Memorv of Dylan Thom;s ' ,where Dickinson emplo-s hexameters wvithout sounding like Clough, and wvhere he comes to terms with his owxn opposite, so to speak, in the person of the poet Reeves may have had in mind. ""Stillness"" is more typical of Dickinson's mood and manner:
The stillness, the still-blue daes
when Sun draws seed from the mnindThe steel-blue brigh7t nights uoi
can fecl The 12eat of the szars
On your touching fingertips
it begins, going on mvsteriouslv to speak of how in that stillness come the moments when wve ""feel the love/Of the lifesavers, the men and wvomen! Who know and te7/Of the deadly powers "". Dickinson inevei- presumes to speak in the voice of those powers, and it is this restraint, this awvareness of his owvn limitations. wvhich gives his verse authoritv.
Elizabeth Darvush, once championed by Yvor Winters, wYho called lier "" one of the few d-stinguished po^ts of our century "", comes wvith a new champion, Donald Davie, introducing her Collected Poems (Carcanet New Press, £3.25). Mrs Daryush, born in 1887, is the daughter of Robert Bridges. I suspect that it is this factstupid as you may find the outcome-wshich has consistently put people off her -work. Bridges is an undervalued and desperately unfashionable poet. At her best, as in the sonnet in svllabic measure, entitled ""Still-Life "", lhich formed the basis of Winters's case 'or her. Mrs Daryush is quite unlike her father, or anv other EngliJh poet, but admirablv true to herself and the lang-uage:
Through the open French
wtindow, the wvarm? s.tnl lights up the polished brcakfr;st-
table, laid round a bowl of crimson roses.
fcr onea service of lW'orcestcr porcelain,
arra'ed. near it a melon, peaches. figs.
small hot rolls in a napkin, fairy r ack of
mnast. buttter in ice, high silver ccffcc
and, heapedl on a sa?ver, thie
morning's post. That is surely as fine a beginning as anv sonnet makes, in English, in this century? And the sestet does not disappoint. Archaisms consciously deployed make some of these poems rather heavy going, if you try to say theni aloud, but the finest woork is as scrupulous and unaffected as the lines I have auoted.

One of the choral masterpieces of the early part of the eighteenth century, Domenico Scarlatti's Stabat Mater, is still underrated and heard too infrequently. As a piece of sustained writing that joins the sound world of his polyphonic predecessors with that of a new harmonic originality, it is a work which, apa.rt from its technicaI skill, overflows with imagination and poetry in its varied yet unified setting of a familiar text. Distant keys are explored, but always in the service of expression, not effect. The
result is at once poignant and exhilarating.
The BBC Singers, using Jurgens's authoritative edition, did the work justice, relishing the chances for choral virtuosity and taking full notice of the many eloquent moments, such as the searching ""Quae morebat "" and the extraordinary beauty of ""Sancta mater "". Where any fault crept in, it was usually of intonation, almost forgiveable in a difficult, tenpart setting. John Poole, the choir's conductor, was concerned to emphasize the contrasts of mood and style, but could sometimes have asked for quieter singing.
Scarlatti senior, Alessandro, was also admirably represented by his serene, rather archaic setting of 0 Magnum Mysterum,
as far removed as possible in the context of its time from his slightly more familiar operas. His Tu es Petrus, also given, comes nearer to the secular world. Both pieces were fervently sung.
So was one of Dallapiccola's last works, Teinpus Destruendi, Tempus Aedificante, a setting of two medieval Latin poems. Like Domenico Scarlatti, Dallapiccola knew how to use the vocal techniques of his time with discernment and confidence. The first piece was more direct, the second more mannered. Both were bold and exclamatory, also keenly fitted to their words. After that, Bach's motet, Lobet den Herrn, seemed almost like light relief for the choir, and they sang it, as befits the music, with joy.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS185433681/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=9b22fe9d

His own poems are delicate and deliberate in the same breath, well-made patterns, witty artefacts. They knock at the mind with all their obscurities, and by virtue of packed arguments and cunning rhyrthms at best resemble Empson in his prime. Here is the point also where I must recommend The Poetic Art, a new translation of Horace's Ars Poetica undertaken bv C. H. Sisson (Carcanet Press, £2.20 and 90p). Mr Sisson is just about the best poet writing in English, so it seems to me, and he uses this opportunity provided by Horace to make a number of observations regarding the contemporary literary set-up, vwhich perhaps is not so far removed from the decad ence noted by his Latin friend'
It isn't clear why he writes, no I

Ever since those notorious Clark Lectures, 20 years ago, when Robert Graves laid into his contemporaries right and left, reserving a particular knockout for Ezra Pound, there has been something of a ten. dency for critics to set these two poets up as opposites. If you are a Gravesian, then you mutter that crack about Pound's Chinese ideograms being copied from the nearest tea chest for all you know. If you are a Poundling, you remind people that Graves's contribution to English letters at the time of Pound's trial was to urge publicly that Ezra should be hung. Yet critics who know better-I am thinking especially of G. S. Fraser-have found the merits of these two poets not mutually exclusive. And people wvho have known both of them-see, for instance, Ronald Duncan's volumes of autobiographyhave even put it on record that they were not unalike in personality.
The ideal Christmas present for your poetical nephew, then, to help these civil wars to cease in his troubled mind, would be Ezra Pound's Selected Poems 1908-1959 (Faber, £3.50 and £1.30) and Robert Graves's Collected Poems 1975 (Cassell, £8.50). Each book is the working record of a lifetime's devotion to poetry. Curiously, it seems to me that both men hit their peak round- about the same moment-Graves with the heart-broken lyrics of lost love which he wrote just prior to The White Goddess (1948), and Pound with that superb eighty-first canto out of the Pisan prison-cage:
Pull down thy vanity, it Is not man Made courage, or made order, or
made grace. Pull down thy vanity, 1 say pull
down Learn of the green world what
can be thy place . . . That sounds a note possibly unique in twentieth century poetry in English. It was a brief magnificence, but the diligent searcher in Pound will find others. I recommend his book in particular for anyone seriously interested in learning the craft of verse. Graves has more obvious technique, but it is used to distance his thoughts and feelings, make them somehow smaller, neater, and more bearable. In Pound you catch a man's mind moving, and the poetry is the movement. Of course, that could be awful, and sometimes it is. The worst Pound is much worse than the worst Graves.
Sydney Goodsir Smith's Collected Poems 1941-1975 (John Calder, £7.50) gathers together the life-work of a Scottish poet who died earlier this year at the age of 59. He
deserves to be better known. Smith's greatest achievement is without doubt ""Under the Eildon Tree "", a series of elegies in which personal and subjective elements are subdued to the myth, of Thomas the Rhymer and his seven-year sojourn in the lands of the Queen of Elphame, and in which the mood shifts with remarkable and successful abruptness from the romantic to the self-satirical. MacDiarmid apart, I rate him the finest Scots-writing poet of the century. This book .shows, amongst other things how well he had heeded MacDiarmid's slogan, "" Not BurnsDunbar !
Alan Brownjohn's A Song of Good Life (Secker & Warburg, £2.90) deliberately does without fireworks. No verbal pyrotechnics here, but good solid craftsmanship, an honest look at the complexity of human relationships. and one or two poems that nag at the memory-less .because of good lines that
stand out, as on account of the absence of lines that stand out, all being delivered to the reader in the same level tone of uncompromising seriousness. I'm not so very keen on the play, "" A Love Song "", which pads out the middle, and occasionally a monotony of scene or ti r e obtrudes-it is usually late afternoon in Mr Brownjohn's world, or late September, or last thing at night, and he'll be sounding tired after a hard day's work-but there is at least one poem here, ""The Ship of Death "", which is better than anything he has ever published before, and which seems to suggest a level of excellence in him still to be fully explored. Mr Brownjohn is genuinely seeking to write the kind of verse which will cast light on soriething dark in human nature. The attempt is honourable.
So are the attempts made in two slim volumes by a newcomer, Simon Curtis. These are Something for Nothing, a flimsy yellow-covered pamphlet, the first publication of an imprint from 17 Mauldeth Road, Manchester- 20, and distributed without a price, and a more accessible book, On the Abthorpe Road and other Poems (Davis-Poynter, £2.50). Mr Curtis writes a poetry which is just the other side of common speech. But this is common speech when it is sensitive and truthful:
A walk through the neighbouring
churchyard shows It is a lesson they well
demonstrate. Those cold foreigners, in their
mossy rows. One it is something to have got
quite straight.
The awkwardness of that final line is deliberate. It is a way of saying it which, I think, Edward Thomas would not have despised. Mr Curtis is a poet to keep an eve on.

Describing it, I have made Oslo. itself descriptive. That is misleading. Mr Howell's wsriting has beein to school to Gertrude Stein, and he makes every noun and verb work. for its keep.

Lawrerice Durrell once wrote a poem about- the Greek poet C. P. Cavafy, in. which he commended him for "" no cant about the sottishness of man "". Mr Durrell, who has a better know. ledge of' the originals -than I have, is already 'on record with approval of the English versions by Edmund Keeley 'and Philip Sherrard in C. P.

174 poems and that most of them read splendidly.with just that mixture of hedonism and disillusion which Cavafy made synonymous with his name. There are helpful notes at the back, by George Savidis, who .draws attention to subtleties of metrical arrangement as well as explaining Cavaf's inytliological and historical allusions-no trivial thing, this, vith a poet whose world was the Byzantine Emoire as well as modern Alexandria.
The Australian poet Peter Porter has some of the same hedonism, and the new wyork he has collected in Living in a Calm Country (Oxford, Ã¯Â¿Â½1.50) showvs him at the height of his powers, writing easily and wittily and well about England and Australia, music and painting, dreams, the, inner life of the middle-aged artist. .1 use that last phrase deliberately. for it contains exactly the kind of irony thlat characterizes Mr Porter's view of things. lie -begins a poem, called "".To Make It Real""

The hero of John Wain's poem Feng (Macmillan, E2.25) is the anti-hero of the original Hamlet story. Feng is the usurping.king, 11 the sick and hallucinated petson who seizes power and then has to live with it "". Mr Wain has gone back behind Shakespeare to Saxo Grammaticus for his myth. Feng is Horwvendil's brother, Amleth's uncle. He murders Horwendil in jealousy, marries his queen Gerutha, and ascends the throne. The end is predictable: Death,
costutmted as Amleth, is coming. I
hear his tread. A few more steps, he will come
thzrough the door eyes steady with hate, sword lifted
for my throat. But in that moment, poised and
framed for killing, he will pause an instant: Surprise
will flash into hlis eyes, and something behind
it: fear. IThe quotation shows the strength and the weakness of Feng. It has a moral dignity and a seriousness fitting in someone who has just published a biography of Samuel Johnson. At the same time, its diction betrays it as uninspired, and its construction, while honest, is awkward-the clumsy repetition of the word ""will"" only underlines the fact that what is being said is banal.
For a longish poem, this one tries to get bv on a minimum of ideas. Accept the limited nature of the attempt and the achievement, and there is pleasure to be had from Mr Wain's concentration upon a handful of images-the tower, stones in a circle, deer fighting
on snow-and his teasing out of meaning from them. In case we miss the modern application he reminds us: ""Since I have lived through an age in which raving madmen have had control of great and powerful nations, the theme naturally seems to me an important one.""
The theme of lain Crichton Smith's The Notebooks of IRobinson Crusoe (Gollancz, Â£2.60) is, I suppose, isolation. There are a number of verses about lonelincss in it-and as usual with this poet a scattering of good poems that certainly look lonely in the company they have to keep. Mr Crichton Smith has always been a hit-or-miss artist, and there are too many misses here - including the title sequence-for the book to be recommendable to someone who does not already know his power. What I admire about this poet in his ability to let go, while remaining in control of his craft. He is best when he stops talking to himself, or the sea, or Charlie Chaplin (he has already said enough on these subjects) and addresses his wit to some less elevated object.
Humour is not-so prevalent in modern verse that I care to let it pass without cheer. Ronald Bottrall's Poems 1955-1973 (Anvil Press, Â£2.95 and Â£1.50) is another book in which the most successful poems are relaxed and amusing, though highly intelligent. Mr Bottrall has other manners, and in par. ticular he can make clipped lyrics on the slightest of excuses in the way of subjects with perhaps more skill than any English metrist since Bridges; but it is the ramblings, confident, autobiograplhical ""Talking to the Ceiling "" which is the triumph here:
Mp father used to stay up late at
night Ostensibly to read theology.
Instead he roamed about the house Sampling a few novels or detective
fiction, Reading for some strange reason The last chapter first.
His night cap was a nip
Of any medicine thtat lay alound.
The direct examination of per. sonal experience also has its rewards in Growing Points (Carcanet Press, Â£2.75 and Â£1.40) which is Elizabeth Jennings' finest book of poems for many years. There is a richer variety of subject-matter and a more significant resourcefulness of rhythm to these poems than one had grown used to in Miss Jennings' work since her Collected Poemns of 1967. That last volume, indeed, is now made to look premature. No future "" Collected "" is going to do.without the superb ""Rembrandt's Late Self-Portraits "", included here, or any of the interesting series of sonnets, from which I quote the end of "" In a Garden "":
I need not have stood lonig
Mocked by the smell of a mown
lawn, and yet
I did. Sickness for Eden was so
strong.
Nostalgia for the infinite is again drawing out the best from Miss Jennings' considerable gifts. No one seriously interested in poetry should miss this book. Two others, also by female poets, which fall into the same category: Ruth Pitter's End of Drought (Barrie & Jenkins, Â£2), since it contains such truthful lines as It was all so desolating, Tragic yet loving: grievous and quite all right; and Molly Holden's The Country Over (Chatto & Windus, Â£1.50) for its poem in which a photograph of Thomas Hardy is compared with a young fox-He was not being sZy, only careful. Miss Holden is in direct line of descent from just about everyone in The Penguin Book of English Pastoral Verse, edited by John Barrell and John Bull (Allen Lane, Â£4) -although how those two splendidly named gentlemen managed to omit Edward Thomas from such a book, when he is the epitome of their tradition and much more besides, I am quiite at a loss to say.

"Spender, Stephen",The language of T S Eliot,The Times,1975-Apr-10,"London, England","THE ARTS
The language of T S Eliot
Today, more than 10 years after his death, Dliot remains a poet enormously admired. Yet his work can scarcely be felt as an influence in our time of ""confessional"" poets, the authenticity of whose poems is guaranteed by the immanence of their suicides, and of those poets who act out their "" turned on"" selves at poetry readings.
Eliot thoughit that it should not be the aim of the poet to ""express !himself "" in his poetry. He thought that, on the contrary, the poet in his work should extinguish his own personality within the wider objective life of the tradition, which, for Eliot, was something very close to being the communion of the dead. The living poet was regarded as a kind of outpost of the dead: to maintain living communication with the past he had to speak to the living in a poetic language which wvas as new as their concerns were new.
Yet although Eliot did not express his ""I "", he revealed in his poetry the imagery and rhythms of a uniquely personal sensibility. And despite his concept of the poet as a craftsman dealing with his material like one concentrating on a task . . . "" in the same sense as the making of an efficient engine or the turning of a jug or a table-leg "", there is autobiographical material in The W!aste Lad, and the last section of that poem was written almost -like automatic writing, wvhen the poet was suffering from a nervous breakdown.
Like Yeats, Eliot is a poet who incorporates oppositesantinomies-in his work. His impersonality has a uniquely personal tone; his traditionalism turns out to be a revolutionary form of modernism; his idea of the poet as a scieptific worker constructing his poems in a laboratory of his mind is consistent with such a scientist producing an extremely mysterious almost indefinable object of ""language rich and strange ""; and in the same poem (Four Quartets) in wvhich the poet is seen as struggling wvith words and concerned wvith "" purifying the language of the tribe "", the poetic word finally merges into the divine Word-the Word made flesh.
In one of several wrvitings about Baudelaire, Eliot maintains that the poets of his owin generation had more in common with the writers of the Nineties than with the literary generation wvhich ""includes Mr Bernard Shaw, and Mr Wells, and Mr Strachey"". The reason he gives for drawing this distinction is that Shaw, Wells and Strachey were the ""progeny of Huxley, and Tyndall, and George Eliot and Gladstone. And with this generation Baudelaire had nothing to do "".
The distinction here made is vital. It explains why certain modern artists, among them Baudelaire and Eliot, seem, in addition to their having unique creative gifts, to have been in possession of some elixir -which gives their work a quality of survival, of unchangeability amid the changes of modern history. The reason does not lie simply in Eliot's studies of the tradition, nor even in his great critical intelligence, but-as a result indeed of these-in the profound realiz. ation and execution in his poetry of the conviction that in art the subject niatter has to become completely transformed into thle texture of the medium-the language become poetry-poetry perliaps very remote from the subject out of which it originated. It is this which the artists of the nineteentlh century-obsessed wvith their subject matter-had largely forgotten, and which poets like Baudelaire, painters like Delacroix and Manet, grasped. Eliot, as a young man, went to school at the symbolist, pure poetry of Baudelaire, Mallarme and Laforgue. He never forgot that poetry is the alchemy of language.
Nevertheless, although he saw poetry as the transformation of the material into a special language governed by rules of tbhe imagination which were "" autotelic "", what makes him a great poet rather than the minor symbolist writer of one of his exquisite early "" Preludes "", is the conflict in his work between the poetry as poetry and the pressure upon the poetry of wvhat it is about. By the ""subject "" of a poem, Eliot meant the poet's philosophy, his beliefs, his actual lived experience and his personality. All these had to be transformed into the language which was so different from them, but they were nevertheless ""there "", and great poetry somehow arose out of great material of life. He was himself a trained philosopher, he became religious, and -he had in hiim all the qualities of the
' man who suffers"" contained within the "" mind which creates "". Thus in his criticism as well as in his poetry he is all his life preoccupied witlh the question of the relationship of the poetry to its subject matter.
He is anxious to cut the umbilical cord connecting the two. And yet he knows that great poems have great subjects. In his earlier- criticism he argues that for a Shakespeare or a Dante his subject matter is simply material of life lying around, which the poet r ealized he may make into great poetry, but without any idea that in the poetry he is expressing some philosophy of life implicit in the subject. Thus, before his own religious
T. S. Eliot
conversions, he argued that for Dante the philosophy of Aquinas was only material which lie recognized was suitable for The Divine Comedy.
Howvever, after he became a Christian it became increasingly difficult for Eliot to maintain that a poet's religion, when he used it as material which he transformed into his poetry , had no connexion with the poetry. qua poetry. The fact thiat in his poetry he evidently believed in the religious views which he held as a man, outside his poetry, caused Herbert Read to comment that Eliot's poetry, after The Waste Land, had become "" moralistic "". However, in Four Quarlets Eliot does not abandon the idea that the poetry is something separate from the subject matter of religious belief which it expresses. If he had done so, Four Quartets would be a didactic poem in which the poet used poetry to illustrate a religious or philosoplhical thesis.
The greatness of Four Quartets is that Eliot makes poetrv out of the quarrel between the idea of there being a subject matter transformed into language which is nothing but the poetry, and the idea of religious truth being expressed in a language which is poetry, but
wvhere the poetry does tlot matter"", because religious truth is wrhat matters. It might be argued indeed that certain mystical experiences can only be expressed in language wvhich is poetry: so that in the poetry of, for example, St John of the Cross, the poetic truth of the imaginlation and the truth held to be literal fact of religion, become one.
In Four Quartets Eliot becomes a great poet, but a good deal of it is not his greatest poetry. His greatest poetry contains a concentration of quintessential transformed language, and is very close to the ""pure"" poetry of ""Those are pearls that were his eyes"" which probably provided for Eliot his ideal of what poetry should be. His prose criticism also contains passages of vivid metaphor-like thnse in Keats's letters-wvlhich strike one with the force of pure poetry. It is his concentrated language wvhich makes Eliot's work a touchstone for other poetry even when his general views about poetry and criticism may be out of fashion.

Poetry of Wales 1930-1970
Edited by R. Gerallt Jones
(Gomer Press, Llandysul, Dyfed, f4.25.)
For English readers this parade of 35 Welsh poets is an eye opener. The difficulties of translating poetry from one language to anothier are immense and notorious. But Gerallt Jones has succeeded in communicating the strength and talent of men w-hose work has had a hitherto limited audlience; as well as the flavour of an important period in the development of Welsh language expression. The 1930s were a watershed in Welsh poetry, Mr Jones remarks, and a larger body of competent verse has been published in Welsh during the past 20 years than at any time in the past 400.
The collection covers a large range, reflecting the changes in Welsh life. It provides an insight into the work of men who served their apprenticeship in the early decades of the century and the work of men now building reputations. Thus it ranges from Gwynn Jones, Williams Parry and W. J. Gruffydd, through the post romantic giants such as T. H. Parry-Williams, Saunders Lewis and Gwenallt, through Waldo Williams and Kitchener Davies, to younger men like Dafydd
Rowlands, Bryan Martin Davies and Gwyn Thomas. During the 1930s Welshmen began to reflect the growth of Welsh nationhood. The best pots, Mr Jones says, bega,n to present the common theme, the nation's plight in the face of the threat to its existence posed by the complexity of modern society. ""Welsh poetry during this time regained an impetus and direction, rediscovered its Christian roots and became specifica'lly and impressively nationaaistic.""
He is concerned, however, at the erosion of the modern poet's position. The Welsh poet is still a social figure of importance but there has been a deepening communication gap between poet and public. Mr Jones says there should be closer examinatlion of the part the media can play in forming a bridge betwen poet and audience and suggests that some distinguished poets should take a less Olympien view of the question of communication. The future, he says, appears uncetain and whether poetry itself can regain a wide audience remains to be seen.
In the meantime this volume performs an important service in enabling the non Welsh reader to share part of the culture of Britain rhat has not been easily accessible to him.

A Nip in the Air
Collected Poems 1929-1974
By John Betjeman
(Murray, fl.50)
By James Reeves
(Heinemnann, f4)
Two years ago, when the runners for the Laureate Stakes were called over, a well-known firm of bookmakers named Auden as odds-on favourite, witlh Betjeman at 5-1 against. In response to inquiries the same firm announced, however, that they wanted "" nice friendly bets only""-something regretted by all who noticed that their know-
ledge of poetic form. was so scratchy. Poets are born, not made, and if any born poet was ever a born laureate that creature is John Betjeman, wbose talent has always been for occasional verse. If any living poet could write a passable set of stanzas on HRH The Prince of Wales dropping in to tea at Balnoral by parachute then it would be Betjenian.
The royal occasions commemorated in A Nip in the Air are less demanding. There is a "" BaUal of the Investiture 1969 "" (You knelt a bog, you rose a mnan./And thus your lonelier life began); there are rhyming couplets, about inland waterways (heaven/Severn) declaimed in the presence of the Queen Mother wvhen she reopened a lock of the Upper Avon; there is "" 14 November, 1973 "", which refers to Princess Anne as a vhite lily and instructs her to glow oni the grotunds that she is high in the poet's heart and other hear ts. These effor ts are disappointingly pallid beside the
unofficial Betieman, best represented here by a satire on the mindless chat of executives (Essenti;ally I integrate the current export drive/And basically I'm viable from ten o'clock' till five); an angry song about county types (God save me from the Porkers); a Broyningesque exercise about a homosexual caught for procuring a minor; and a poem about Aldershot Crematorium
The oddest Item is a letter addressed to one Mary Wilson: Dear Mary,
Yes, it wuill be bliss
To go with you by train to Diss ... Can our Poet Laureate really be asking the wife of our Prime Minister to accompany him on a railway trip to Diss, Norfolk for an unspecified purposei Diss is the Latin for hell, of course, but that is no excuise. The poem fusses about whether the ronmantic pair should travel first class, for fear of reporters, or second, for socialistic reasons. It ends with a line to make the stuffed owl hoot: Dear Mary Wilson, thiis is Diss. It is all rather splendid and I await the denial from Downing Street.
James Reeves never ran in the l.aureate Stakes. He is a true poet, and true poets tend not to run in anything, except the memory:
Do you too wonder ff the finest
thzing A promising flower can do
rs but to imitate with all its art
All other flowers that ever grewv ' You looking from vour window
see the spring Each year perform its leisurely Long act of memory,
All nature gone into rememberinig. What am I to say of this? That it is ""too reasonable and too truthful ""-Yeats's dismissive comment on reading Reeves's fiist book, from wvhich it cozties? Yes, wvell, Yeats had a point. You can be bored bv Reeves's neatness, by his need to make his verse formally watertight. But then there is another Reeves, a Reeves who wvrites untidy, inspired angry poems that seem too well up from quite a different source. I am thinking of such things as ""Greenhallows "", which as you read it becomes your onv dream; and "" The Little Brother""; and the four compelling lines which make up a strange poem, ""Song"":
Suffer these hands, the heart's
interpretation.
Because r come to vou as one who
comes
Not at the minute's nor the mind's
dictation,
Suffer these hands, the heart's
interpretation.
I will say of this only what I would say of the second stanza of ""TThoughts and Memories5"" quoted above-that here surely is the authentic accent of English poetry when it gets beyond personality, or when it salts a man's tongue as plainly as in Clare or Coleridge or Hardy. I hope that his Collected Poems 1929-1974 brings James Reeves at last to the attention of the wide public. So much the worse for the wide public if it does not.

Auden has been dead a year. Confronted with his posthumous Thank You, Fog (Faber, E1.75) can one wish this Mr W. H. all happiness and his measure of eternitie ? Here are 19 poems and an antimasque. Nothing leaps from the page with those rhythms which made him such a power when he was young. Everywher e there is artful monochr ome, consciouslv unambitious irony, a setting for that light verse where his talent was at home.. 1 won't disparage a strange achievement. In the last years of his life Auden made light verse bear a weiglht of seriousness. There is a sense in which he ended up writing poems like capers cut in carpet slippers, winking, artful, domestic verse, made from an awareness of the limitations of his talent, and a moral insistence on the rules of the "" game"" which is poetry. The nicest poems in Thank You, Fog are a relief when seen against the poe-faced visages of some of his surviving contemporaries, still addicted to language as magic.
Take the title piece. This celebrates his return to England from America in 1972. ln skilful syllabics (seven to the line) he welcomes differences between New York smog and fog in the Wiltshire countryside at Chi-istmas, immuring him with friends in a manor-house. Birds sing (those "" whose blood/is brisk enough ""), but mostly he praises El landscape of bare trees condensing the weather "" to definite drops "", while

Donald Davie, %hvl "" has absented himself in California since 1968, has recently shown a comparable concern with Englishness. His collection Tle Shires (Routledge, E2.50) offers a poem about each of the English counties. The book strikes me as tourism, with Davie paying visits not merely to the obvious aspects of each. place but to the scenery of his own talent. Every county gets a literary accolade-although to drag in John Fowles for Dorset, when William Barnes gets no mention, seems wvorse than fashionable. The veise is slack -"" Derbyshire "" looks like a sonnet witth octave and sestet, but consists of rhymed
couplets; a pepper of exclamation marks tries to do the job of feeling; photographs doctored to make silhouettes on the pages where the poems are printed cannot disguise the book's triviality. Davie's nostalgia has been ill-served by an attempt to try on Betieman's old suits with none of Betjeman's panache.
Full of descriptions of places that have taken his fancy, Charles Tomlinson's TIze Way In (Oxford, £1.25) shows off a painter's eye-snow is seen as "" a batter of ash and crystals "", pylons in moonlight are "" frigid lattices "". Such observation is pretty, but this poet is forever trying to wring Deep Meaning from it and his verse splinters into fragments of philosophy. Someone once described Tomlinson as a glum fellow trying to learn how to play the flute. There's little joy to his perceptions. The same goes for Douglas Dunii, but then Duiin has no flautist ambitions, and his Love or Nothing (Faber, £1.25) brinigs together poems in a good, plain voice. I like "" The Wlhite Poet "", which showvs there is still.stuff to be learnlt from Laforgue, and ""AArs Poetica "", a fantasy about typewriters writing poems on typewriters: We are the 'Typewriter Mutses, wve

Strong. .
Dunn is a witty poet, inclined to let wit shape a poem when inspiration dries up. David Black r elies more upon fancy. The Happy Cr-ow (Lines Editions: Macdonald, Edgefield Road, Midlothian, S0p) shows him digging away in his own weird mine of sin and philosophy, often discovering nothing more interesting than a few Zeen tags ; but it also has a splendid poemn ("" The WaterLily "") in praise of the riches of the depths of unknowing, a handful of lyrics with an origilal pulse, and a longish poem called "" Melusine "" that is remarkable.
Black is Scottish. His absence from Madle in Scotland, edited iy Robert Garioch (Carcanet, £2.S0 & £1.25) is a serious omission in an anthology otherwise notable for good poems by Robin Fulton, Tom Buchan, and Paul Mills. Stewart Conh's New Poems 1973-74 (Hutchinson, £2), the annual PEN anthology, is mo-e coherenit than volumes in this series usually are.
Finally, magazines. The anniiversary issue of the Quarterly Reviewv of Literature is a paperback book (26 Haslett Avenue.

It is said that their high expectations are lured away by siren voices chanting ""To Daffodils "" and are crushed under limp-bound Selections from Tennyson (with notes).
Recently some attempts have been made to provide a bridge by adopting the fairly obvious expedient of building out from the playground. Among the qualities that make children's verse so universally enjoyable are its spirited rhythm and humour, and in anthologies like Geoffrey Summerfield's Voices-whose three volumes were three good reasons why Penguin Education should never have been allowed to die -one saw a great editor leading young readers from street-songs and graffiti to some of the .greatest poetry there is.
There was precedent for Voices in two other anthologies Dawn and Dusk and Rising Early (Brockhampton Press) edited by Charles Causley, who has triumphed again in his recent Puffin Book of Magic Verse (35p). As its title implies, the book is more narrowly based than its predecessors, but Mr Causley is generous in his interpretation of ""magic"" -partly, one suspects, to keep a foothold in the world of children's rhymes. ""The Man in the Wilderness"" (who asked of me/"" How many blackberries grow in thze sea ?"") rubs shoulders with ""La Belle Dame Sans Merci"" ; a popular recitation against warts with some of Robert Her. rick's filigree "" charmes "".
As poet rather than editor (his funny ballad about Colonel Fazackerly Butterworth-Toast is included in Magic Verse) Charles Causley is also a representative of the gallant band who have tried to carry children across the chasm by writing poetry that itself carries echoes of the playgrounds-an altogether more difficult commission than compiling' anthologies. One of its most notable practitioners is Ian Serraillier, a selection of whose work .spanning the last thirty years, has been published as The Robin land the Wren (issued, not very appropriately, by Kestrel
The Headless Gardener
A gardener, Tobias Baird,
sent his head to be repaired;
he thought, as nothing much was wrong, hc wouldn't be without it long.
Ten years he's weeded path and plot, a headless gardener, God wot, always hoping (hope is vain)
To see his noddle back again.
Don't pity him for his distresshe never sent up his address.
A Fritz Wegner Illustration from Tle Robin and the Wren.
Books, Â£1.75). The "" childish "" qualities are obvious: not just the dominance of Fritz Wegner's pictorial designs, which -sometimes command more space than the verse, but also Mr Se*raillier's liking for the poetic treatment of nursery literature. He writes a five-verse set of variations on ""The North Wind doth Blow"" in his title poem, f*or instance, and he neatly versifies such fables as ""The Rabbit and the Fox"" and ""The Town Mouse and the Coluntry Mouse "".
Ian Serraillier's manner with these children's themes is however a step away
from childhood. As well as lengthening and embroidering his sources, he gives them a modern idiom-a conversational tone, which flattens out the ""poetry"" and prevents it froni getting'too lush or facile. (There is almost an echo of Dr Seuss in "" What, swallow that muck ? "" said the mouse from the town./"" It would stick in my throat. It wouldn't go down."")
This roughening of the surface is a skilful way of suggesting that poetry. is. more approachable than the schoolroom allows-a technique even more evident in Michael Rosen's Mind Your Own Business (Deutsch, Â£1.25) whose contents range from Old Ben Brown ""who played the ukelele with his trousers down "", through the farcical saga of ""My brother got married in a wimpy bar"", to a group of poems where the artist's perception is intensified by the cheerful informality of his verse.
Mr Rlosen is happy to write whole poems as conversation pieces and he has a nice ear for the way kids speak (peas for breakfast please he said/and a plateftul of peas is what he got), his uninhibited enjoymenTt of the whole operation standing in sharp contrast to the well-meaning but rather stiffjointed attempts of more famous poets to write ""with young people in mind "" (a phrase with more than a hint of condescension). These are the Chatto Poets for the Young, edited by Leonard Clark, a series in which four new contributors have just appeared (75p each). John Fuller's Squeaking Crust comes nearest to catching the energy of popular verse and his poem sequence for music "" Fox-trot "" probably comes over well in performance, but like two other volumes (D. J. Enright's Rhyme Times Rhyme and Phoebe Hesketh's A Song of Sunlight) the humour is often quirky rather than broad, and there are subtleties of allusion and phrasing which demand the response of a committed reader. of poetry. Vernon Scannell's The Apple-Raid is perhaps the most successful book of the four ""for young veople ""- partly because it is not so self-conscious and partly because it seems more convinced, as its author says, that he who needs no poetry or bread/is really in a devilish bad way.

. . . _
There are few enough authentic poets at any time to make the task of discovering and trying to define them difficult-without bothering whether they come dressed in Faber grey or Gollancz yellow, or whether their stitches are up to the standard of tailoring we expect from Oxford University Press. All the same, the activities of one contemporary publishing house have now reached such e pitch that I feel something must be said about it.
Cai canet Press began a few years ago by publishing pamphlets and first collections by *a handful of vaguely Oxfordorien:ated young men. Now, fi-oni an unlikely address (266 Councillor Ilane, Cheadle Hlulme, Cheadle, Cheshire SK8 SPN), it is pttblishing under its variouis imprints new and old work of much variety and r e- sou rcefuln ess.
Elizabeth Daryush. the daughter of Robert Bridges and virtual inventor of syllabic verse, was rediscovered by this firm. They re-publish HD, high priestess of Imagism, in heer later- manifestation as a visionary of the blitz. They issued two months ago what is already being recognized as one of the most important volumes of collected poems to appear since the war-C. H. Sisson's In tize Trojan Ditch. Criticism and translation have not been neglected by Carcanet either. And the second volume of the
book-form magazine PoetrV Nation, published twice yearly uiider their aegis, is now in the shops (£2.90 annual subscriptioIl).
The back cover of a Carcanet book reads these days with something of the authority which Faber books used to possess in Eliot's prime. Their authors are a roll-call of achievement and promise. Within this.house there is plainly an informed and enthusiastic passion for poetry, and a comnmitmettt to poetry which cares more about the dialect of the tribe than the money in the bank. Passion and commitment have not been so popular among publishers, or common in their minions, that the literary world can afford to ignore them.
Besides Poetry Nation- 2- vhich contains the best new poem for yeais from the pen of Elizabeth Jennings, and good poems by Gareth Reeves, Douglas Dunn, Daniel Weissbort, Stewvart Conn and Roger Garfitt, as well as some bInilliantly sceptical criticism, notably bv Colin Falck on Robert Lowell-five new Carcanet titles lie before me. George Kendi-ick's Bicycle Tyre in a Tall Tree (£2 and £1.25) is the most interesting-a first collection by a young poet with an educated ear and a gift of thiinking with his imagination. Kendrick tries on various suits from the British Home Stores of modernism, but his best suit is his owin offhand sen1se of humour:
I woutld say a bicycle tyre in a
tall tree has real poise, for there the birds
twill sing and all the buds break into
-- geotnetrU. What a good throto thjat was.
Humour is just what Jon Silkin lacks. The Principle of Water (Carcanet. £2.20 and £1.25) is his most extended selection for some time, and here, as before, lhis earnestly groping verses in praise of vegetables and waterwhleels doing their stuff in the north country remind me too often of Erasmus Darwin's Loves of the Plants. Silkin is like a boxer forever flexing his muscles and snarling at the air, but never hitting anything much. Perhaps a larger subject than swelf or slag-heaps would help ?
I have room only to mention the three other books as demonstratiAig Carcanet's versatility: Tyorkin & the Stovemakers (£2.50), poetry and prose by Alexander Tvardovsky, editor of Novy Mir, translated from the Russiap by Anthony Rudolf; Ten Anglo-Welsh Poets, edited by Sam Adams (£2.50 and £ 1.25), which includes work by Gwyn Williams, Glyn Jones, Roland Matlhias, Harri Webb, Leslie Norris, John Ormond, Raymond Garlick, John Tripp, Gillian Clarke, and John Pook; and Ten Irish Poets, edited by Jlames Simmons (£2.50 and £1.25), whiclh has work by its editor and George Buchanan, John Hewitt, Padraic Fiacc, Pcarse Hutchinson, Michael Hartnett, Eilean Ni Chuilleanain, Michael Foley, Frank Ormsby, and Tom Mathews: These anthologies, published with support from various Arts Councils, do well to direct attention to distinctive vitalities outside the usual province of London.

Iago was an honest man ;/1 have that reputatdon too.
Poems have tO do w~ith saying such thing6. Poetry is that way of saying them. C:. H. Sisson is a poet-a man impelled to find personal rhythms for some more-than-personal truth. It would be hard to speak too highly of his In the Trojan Ditch: Collected Poems & Selected Translations (Carcanet Press, Â£3.25). Sisson belongs with those who have used common speech to say things not commonly said-Edwvard Thomas, the early Eliot, Hardy, Barnes, Donne, Raleigh. . . . I reach back for names. English verse in this century has not been so thick with them that anyone who cares for it can afford to ignore Sisson.
He was born in 1914, wrote verse in adolescence, stopped at 20, started again in a troopship on the way to the war, but did not begin writing the poems by which he will be remembered until about 1950. The present book starts with his most recent verse, including ""The (Jak "", which is remarkable in speaking from places where the mind prefers silence-Christ is a language in which we speak to God/And also God, so that we speak in truth. As a guideline, a reviewver might refer attention to a valediction which comes half-way through:
Catullus my friend across rtwenty centuries,
Anxious to complete vour lechery before Christ carne
since much of Sisson's journey is a* return to source and an attempt to reknit Christianity to the pagan world, or rather to explore the relationship of the flesh of paganism and the religion of the Incarnation. Do not fail tO StOp at ""The Crucifix "",
""Human Relations "", ""~ The Garden of Epicurus "", "" A Letter to John Donne "", and ""sIn a DaTk Wood "". TShese will read you. Indeed, if. you are a poet the difficulty may be in starting again once they have done so.
The poems in Philip Larkin's Hi'gh Windows (Faber, Â£1.40) remain loyal to past victories on a small patch of ground. Once more Larkin provides the modest lyrical bits ("" Cut Grass "", "" The Trees""); the formal essay-poems in which a subject-visiting the sea, looking at old men, disliking hospitals-is treated in metres de-
cently subdued to their occasions; and the tough stuff. The last is least interestingLarkin goes on about other (younger) chaps getting their sexual share, and more, while it seems (from ""Sad Steps"") that he only gets out of bed to piss and look at the moon, or gets back into bed to write poems about pissing and looking at the moon. There's something laugh. able about thzis . . . The line falls out of that particular poem and takes a cruel peek at some of the others.
If Larkin visits Dublin you can bet there'll be a funeral before the end of the first stanza. And when he raises his voice now, letting off the selfsatirical brakes to bring one of the longish pieces to a halt, the result is an alliterative whim. per-no more smashing ""poetical "" cliches as in "" An Arundel Tomb "" or that stuff about love being like an enormous yes in the poem about the jazz clarinet player in The Whitsun IVeddings; these days it's hospital visitors With wasteful, weak, propitiatory flowers....
Still, the same old Larkin (.ike Eliot, he always seems a generation older than he is) remains the same decent old Larkin. His unfurnished poetry Of furnished rooms is certainly his own.
It used to be Anthony Thwaite's as well, but now he has read St Augustine and in New Confessions (Oxford, Â£1.50) tries on that saint's skin to create ""a personal book of meditation and transmutation"". The dove is not our pigeon, as it says on page 37. Who is going to disagree? I prefer my Augustine straight, and my Thwaite cutting his suburban grass with Larkin's Qld mower.

The Puffin Book of Magic Verse, edited by Charles Causley (Puffin, 35p). Anthologies of poetry made for children have got steadily better and better during the past half-century and during the past decade Charles Causley has made two of the best of them. In his new book (splendidly. a paperback, and an inexpensive one) he has gathered goose-pimpling verse "" about"" warlocks and ghosts, giants and changelings, together with charms, spelils and curses.
He prints well over 150 poems, many of which one would not expect from most anthologizers, who would have been unlikely to catch. say, Edith pitwellis The youth with the red-gold hair, A. L. Rowse's Ardevora Veor, or A. E. Housman's Her strong enchantments failing. Barbara Swiderska provides chilling linedrawings and an irresistable cover design. Only the presence of the illustrations, and perhaps the careful simplicity of the excellent introduction (""All poetry is magic. It is a spell against insensitivity,. failure of imagination, ignorance, and barbarism "") convey the slightest hint that this is a book meant for young readers. AU is, in facr, as it should be.

David Jones is now famous as the poet Larkin left out of the latest Oxford anthology. Since Yeats omitted Laura Riding from its predecessor, history may see these Oxford books as of interest because they managed between them to neglect two of the most important Twentieth century poets in English. Thze Sleeping Lord and Otlter Fragments (Faber, £2.95) ivill enable readers to judge the truth of the first of these suggestions. For extended analyses of Jones, I refer attention to the issue of the magazine Agenda devoted to his work (1967); as for Riding the current issue of the magazine Stand contains a useful introduction to her poems and to her subsequent rejection of poem-writing as an insufficient means of truth-telling.
Jones and Riding have this in common: a seriousness which I shall call religious. Jones is a Christian, Riding is not, but they might find common ground in a phrase Simone Weil used, of the world being "" God's language to us "". It is by delight in that language, and specifically by returning to the central act of the Christian faith as an anamnesis, a re-callingi or re-presenting of an event in the past "" so that it becomes here and now operative by its effects"" (the words are those of Dom Gregory Dix) that Jones has made his poems. He is modest about these makings, calling The Anathemnata (1952), for example, "" fragments of an attempted writing "". In effect all his verse is a meditation upon the Iiicarnation and Crucifixion. It is sacrametital. He sees man as of his nature a poet, since he is one ""who makes things that are signs of something "", and in that making which is the Mass he sees made not just sign but Signature.
The poems collected in the new book are beautiful. They take speech-the speaking of soldiers stationed in Palestine ""in the earlier decades of the
first century AD "", and others at the edges of the Roman Empire-and they move the mind through a supra-historical ""present"" in which there is no distinction between what happens now and what happened then.
I think Jones is a visionary poet, comparable with Blake, and that if you take the trouble to read him in the light of his sources-the liturgy, and Dix and Maurice de la Taille on the liturgy-you may arrive at the conclusion wvhich Anthony Thwaite offers in his Poetry Today 1960-1973 (Longman Group, for British Council, 50p), that when these fragments are gathered they will be perceived to provide "" an historical Christian counterpart to what Ezra Pound failed to achieve in the Cantos "". Thwaite's pamphlet is worth getting for many judgments in which a similar soundness finds quiet vords for itself.
I Prayers
Are not the rafts on wliich we slzall
be saved.
We say no grace. We seek it in our
food.
Thus Philip Oakes, whose Married I Singular (Andre Deutsch, £1.25) could not be farther away-from Jones. Yet I wonder.... Oakes is a materialist. He writes of food and spiders and tea and bedmaking. He creates an active surface of words, through which his subjects come alive. But Jones is more of a mater. ialist, taking matter to its conclusion. Oakes would be shy of that, but he fashions authentic verse of the shyness, and I like his truth to the limitations of experience. The same goes for P. J. Kavanagh's Edward Thomas in Heaven (Chatto & Windus, £1,25). This poet mistrusts the romantic, yet is full of nostalgia:
I wear my grave-clothes and I do
not mind.
Small trills escape from small birds
suddenly:
I'm going nowhere and the
thought's my friend.
Full of michief, too. See ""The Famous Poet"". a satire on that aspect of Ted Hughes which stalks through woods full of feathered Fascists

"Blyth, Alan",Poetry and Prey,The Times,1974-Mar-04,"London, England","Poetry and Prey
We know Hermann Prey today as much as an opera singer as a Lieder interpreter, yet when he set out on his career he had no idea of going on the stage and intended to devote his life to song and that alone. Nowadays, as his schedule tells you, Liederabende have to take their place alongside appeara!nces at the Metropolitan, La Scala, Vienna, Salzburg and Covent Garden.
In a sense he is still truest to his first lorve because there, as he puts it, "" the success of the evenings depends on vou and nobody else"". His programme for his recital at the Festival Hall tonight contains quite a number of Goethe settings. How much did his choice of songs depend on the quality of the poetry ?
"" When I was younger I could only sing settings of poems I admired. Now I feel that there are many songs where, even if the words don't mean so much to me, I find consolation and satisfaction in .the cut of the melody or the harmonic interest. But, naturally enough; when you get fine poetry as well as fine music, the rewards are stilil greater. Even more interesting is to contrast, as I'm going to do, two different settings of the same poem-in this case Schubert's and Loewe's of Goethe's Erlk6nig "".
Schlusnus was Prey's idol when he set out on his career in the early 1950s. ""After all, he was the most admired Lieder singer of the previous generation, and I wasbound to be influenced by him. Today I think I've moved away from Schlusnus's predominantly lyrical approach to a more dramatic one, where the treatment of the texts has perhaps gained in significance for mealthough of course I hope I'm not neglecting the importance of a beautiful line.""
Prey has strong views on accompanists. "" I find it hard to have as my accompanist a player who has worked with one singer thle day before, me today, and yet a t!hird artist tomorrow. That's no way ta gain rapport. I'm not blaming the pianists ;because this is a fact of recitatl life and they have to earn a living, but it is not altogether satisfactory. For years, until we ihad a disagreement on interpretation, I worked happily with Brendel. Of late, I have worked quite regularly with Leonard Hokanson, who is partnering me in 7 Lfondon. I'm sure that in the I future each singer will have to jform a duo with one particular pianist. It should be a kind of I marriage.""
jThe operatic side of Prey's ;career began. with the Wmppertata and Wiesoaden companies , in 1951-52, but soon he was
spotted by Gunther RKennert who tooks him on the roster at Hambhurg, where he remained until 1960. "" For a lonlg time I
did small roles, or else larger ones in modern opera-good for the musical development but bad for the voice. My breakthrough came in operetta, a work by Honegger called Les Aventures du Roi Pausole. After that Rennert began to have faith in me and I got major parts. .1 suppose the decisive step on to the international kdder came in 1957 when I sang Figaro in a new production of Barbiere at Vienna, and that rwle and Wolfram have been my most successful outside the German-speaking world. I think -1 was the first German baritone to appear as Rossini's Figaro at both La Scala and the Metropolitan, and of course I made my Covent Garden debut in the part last season.""
Oddly enough, in Mozart's opera it is the Count not Figaro that has up to now been his part. Although he will be the Count in next month's Scala production he hopes soon to have a chance to sing Mozart's exbarber at Munich. It touches on a. sore point in Prey's thoughts. "" It's such a pity that most opera houses look for a bass or bassbaritone rather than a true baritone both for that part and for Don Giovanni. If you listen to the singers of the past in the arias from Giovanni l'ou can hear my idea of the title role, a light, elegant, rather degenerate sound. Giovanni should sound liglht and airy so that he contrasts with Leporello.""
He thinks, too, that more of the Verdi roles would be in his grasp, were there a return to an older approach to that composer, and gives a graphic example from Rigoletto to prove his point. In his Hamburg days he sang Posa, and he wants to do the part again, but only in a new production of Don Carlos. He would also like to sing Falstaff soon. But I put it to him that perhaps he should be satisfied with being the best Papageno, Guglielmo and Wolfram of the day.
"" Yes, of course I get satisfaction from 'doing those parts well but I would like to enlarge my repertory, specially in the Strauss field. You know I made my Salzburg debut in 1959 as that other barber in Schweigsame Frau and of course I sang Storch in the famous Munich Internezzo, which came to Edinburgh in 1965. I would like now to go on to Barak, Jochanaan .and Mandryka. Why don't they do a new Arabella for me in Munich ? Well, you write to Mr Rennert and tell him that. The only trouble witb these Strauss parts is that the orchestration is -so heavy when the baritone comes in. Just look at Mandryka's long monologue in the first act of Arabella. Strauss didn't like his male singers; thaes quite clear. But with the right conductor. * . .""

It is easy to miss the merits of Andrew Young. His poems are quiet. They do not show off a personality. They make no fuss about tradition. They just are. And, like all real poetry, this means that what they are is neither old nor new, but seemingly remembered even the first time we read it: It it should come to this
You cannot wake me with a kiss. Think I but sleep too late
Or once again keep a cold angry
state.
Young was not always as good as that. But his Complete Poems (Secker & Warburg, Â£4.50; paperback, Â£2.25), as arranged by Leonard Clark contains enough to make it probable that a dozen of his poems arc already table-talk among that company where Donne sits down to dine with Edward Thomas. He died two years ago at the age of 86, after a crowded but unambitious life as priest, poet, topographer and naturalist.
Following a dead master, it is fitting, if dispiriting, to turn to some live beginners. Colin Falck's Backwards into the Smoke (Carcanet Press, Â£1.75
paperback, 90p) is costive with its own integrity. Verses are squeezed out of the toothpaste tube of Self, and worlds of significance made to depend upon brief shrugs of imagery, especially when the First Person Singular addresses the Second Person Singular in what we may take to be a relatedness of sexual feeling. Yet if I cannot admire the tube I yet must concede considerable skill in the squeezing. The American- Samuel Menashe, in Fringe of Fire (Gollancz, Â£2), risks coyness and cosiness in offering flimsy imagistic frag. ments as though they were the outcomne.of L classical restraint; while I have never felt that his lines achieVe the intensity, aimed, for, some of them have a lapidary charm, not unlike LTndor:

Elaine Feinstein's The Celebrants and Other Poems (Hutchinson, 2l; paperback, Â£1.20) and Kathleen Raine's On a Deserted
Shore (Hamish Hamilton, Â£2) try to clarify spiritual mysteries within human relationships, especially as these may be uncovered in man-woman love. These two poets have it in common that they establish a valid metaphysics out of their experiences as women.
Alan Ross's The Taj Express (London Magazine Editions, Â£2) is more enjoyable in its evocation of place than anything of his which I have read before. Nor are these merely wish-youwere-here poem-postcards, since the sense of geography is coextensive with an expression of mood. usually senrsual, giving the verse close texture with what it describes.
Just room to recommend Peter Ackroyd's London Lickpenny (Ferry Press, 60p), which is notably at the other end of the scale from Andrew Young, favouring an impenetrable surrealism jamming together lines in a flat, hallucinated style reminiscent of the early John Ashbery. None of this would be of anv import if Ackroyd did not show indelible signs of mind. This heady mixture of distinctive rhythmic vitalities is Just the sort of thing which authentically inspired poets produce in a first book, for if you. do not start out rich how can you expect anyone to believe in your later refinings?

I ._.
In 1968 there was a translation competition, adjudicated by George Steiner, in The Sunday Times. The poem set was Baudelaire's ""Spleen "". Steiner was perhaps rendered splenetic himself when versions rained on him from all over the country, bearing such pseudonyms as Henry Birdsong and W. H. Laudanum, each typed in green and brown. Their author was Nicholas Moore, son of philosopher G. E. Moore, known as a poet in the Forties. when he worked with Tambimuttu on Poetry London, largely forgotten since.
Since T ambi's day, Moore has been growing flowers-he is the author of The Tall Bearded Iris, which he describes modestly as out-of-date. Steiner's challenge tore him away from horticulture and back into an orgy of verse, the results of which may be found in Spleen (Menard Press with Blacksuede Boot Press: 1 Primrose Gardens, London, NW3, 60p). This would make a nice last-minute Christmas present for anyone who shares Robert Frost's view that poetry is what gets lost in translation, or who appreciates little presses doing witty and literate things.
Moore's high spirits conceal a seriousness set forth in his preface, "" On the Impossibility of Translation "", wher.* he argues that all a poet does when he translates is produce a version of himself in foreign fancy dress which may or may not suit him. The felicities and faults of his 31 parody poets (who include Nicholas Moore) are various enough to prove his case.
One of the poets parodied, HD, otherwise Hilda Dolittle, Empress of Imagism, has been resurrected with a foreword by Norman Holmes Pearson in Trilogy (Carcanet Press, Â£2.50; paperback, Â£1.25), which collects three sequences inspired by the
bombing of London. A blitz of apocalyptic imagery blurs the Hellenic style, and the most that can be said of these effusions is that they are not as bad as Edith Sitwell's "" Still Falls the Rain "", with which rhetoric they deserve to be compared. HD translating bombs into angels is too much.
George Barker's In Memory of David Archer (Faber, Â£1.95) celebrates the publisher of his first book. Barker has suffered from comparisons with Dylan Thomas, and it's true that at his worst he goes on about wombs and tombs and rods and roses, while the iambic pentameters strut like traffic wardens looking for symbols to book. The new volume has much worse, but also its quota of best, and this poet when he is thinking sounds like Blake rewritten by Byron, which is to say that he is a romantic with an ear for speech. rhythms.
R. S. Thomas, poet and priest, works at the other end of the scale, as anyone can see from Selected Poems 1946-1968 (HartDavis, MacGibbon, Â£2.95). Chary of rhyme, Thomas's poems puzzle out their meaning through assonance, returning again and again to the emblematic figure of his peasant parishioner lago Prytherch. I confess to wishing that Prytherch wor ld answer Thomas back just once; he might mention, for instance, that he is fed up with being forever poeticised, however bleakly, as turning the pages of the fields. Nevertheless, if Thomas has been writing the same poem for 22 years it is a real poem. He knows his country to the bone.
So does Alasdair Maclean, whose From the Wilderness (Gollancz, Â£2; paperback, -1) has a coherence which springs from the poet using his experience as a orofter up on the hard peninsula of Ardnamurchan. Maclean writes about the seasons and peat-cutting and .tems of local history, but he is closer to John Claire than to any who have exaggerated the pleasantness of country life. He is bitter about what is happening to the Highlands-just as Clare was angry about Enclosures. But don't read this book for natronising political reasons.
Briefly, may I recommend the neo-Augustan stylishness of John Fuller's Epistles to Several Persons (Secker & Warburg, E1.75 ; paperback, Â£1), and the more complicated elegance of his dad Roy's Tiny Tears (Andrie Deutsch, Â£l 50). Both Fullers also turn up in the PEN anthology, New Poems 1972-73, edited by Douglas Dunn (Hutchinson, Â£2), which manages to be catholic yet discriminating.

The Faber Book .of Love Poems, edited by Geoffrey Grigson (Faber, Â£3.25)
The Penguin Book of Love Poetry; edited by Jon Stallworthy (Allen Lane, Â£3.25)
There are two views of love and poetry. The first is that what gets said between persons in that condition constitutes the one story and one story only, the single poetic theme underlying all others, and that the proper study of poetkind is therefore Woman. The other holds that a poet in love is not more likely than a plumber to write a good poem about it. Robert Graves has been a proponent of the first view. Roy Fuller recently went on record with the second.
- These two anthologies don't settle the argument, although if either appeared in a cheaper edition it might sell well to plumbers looking for verses which they could pass off as their own in order to seduce female customers. Grigson's is for your intellectual plumber, with pretensions to regret and philosophy if not syphilis. Stallworthy's gives the more urgent
note, the a Christ, if my love were in my arms,/And I in my bed again"" bit. As it happens, each includes the anonymous poem from which that cry comes, and there's a degree of overlapping of other material, as you'd expect.
With moderns, Grigson has the securer taste-his Eliot is the superb "" La Figlia Che Piange "", for instance, where Stallworthy's is that embarras. singly awful "" Dedication to My Wife"" from The Elder States. man. At the same time Stallworthy prints a feeble piece of juvenilia by Hart Crane wvhen presumably he could have chosen any of the lyrics from the same poet's mature volume, White Buildings. Grigson incluides an extravagant heap of Greek marble chippings by Landor. George Barker, Kenneth Patchen, and Robert Frost don't get a single poem into either book. Neither does that pretty good love poet Dante Alighien, but then She might have opened up areas beyond Muses or plumbing.

Sooner or later it occurs to every English poet to write a long poem about King Arthur, and while we can be glad that most resist the temptation we may equally be grateful thlat John Heath-Stubbs has not. Heath-Stubbs is a classic-minded but romantic-spirited writer, and his Artori7us (i nitllhaimon Press, Â£3.50) combines scholarship and inspiration in fair proportion.
Ranging through a variety of forms, this heroic poem provides pleasure by its shape alone-no inconsiderable thing in days when poets have forgot. ten Yeats's injunction that they ""learn their trade "". Artorius himself stands for the poet as archetypal form-maker. His defence of Roman values aaainst barbarism has parallels with our situation: "" Living as we do at the beginning of the Second Dark Age."" But the epigraphs give subtler clues. Milton pitted against Tom o' Bedlam, and it is because Heath-Sttubbs hias both in him that his poem gen.c rates tension to justify its length.
Artorius as a *vhole pursues not simply Form, but "" the White Stag, the unattainable "" ; its various voices have the poet's quintessential gift, "" I become what I sing ""; a guideline
is its returning to that boast of Taliesin's, from the Mabinzogioni. where he declares that he has existed as a catechist of order from the world's beginning. In one memorable section, in Book 2, Gwion/Taliesin informs us that he has been all the poets, from Langland to Dylan Thomas. These are pleasures noticed from a first reading. This is a text to be reread.
Peter Porter in Jonah (Secker & Warburg, Â£4.75), has collaborated with the painter, Arthur Boyd, to produce a series of poetic and pictorial annotations to the Biblical story. Apollo and Dionysus, reason and imagination, have never sat comfortably together at Porter's table. He has either been too reasonable, hence dull, or too imaginative, hence incoherent. Here the mythopoeic subject gives him a focus, and the result is a confusion-cancelling seriousness which sounds inspired. Jonah's prose journal of his spell inside the whale serves to flex Porter's muscles for formal poems in praise of God's other creatures: worm, gourd, cat. The epilogue returns to celebrate order with severity, burning the Dionysian torch at Apollo's altar:
For us the Garden is set in its
clockwork glorv,
Nineveh sits by the river forever
in the story.
No-one is old and God listens on
his throne,
At the end the bone sings: 71e
hears the singing bone.
The work to which I am draw-
ing attention is not self-expression, but the expression of something more mysterious and recalcitrant than self. Few have expressed that more sensitively or witlh a stricter sense of word-rightness than Osip Mandelstam, the Russian whose caustic and lucid poems, the epitome of a wholly modern classicism, are now starting to appear in English. His Selected Poems, translated by Clarence Brown and W. S. Merwin (Oxford, Â£2.50), should be compared with another Selected Poems. translated by David McDuff (Rivers Press, Â£2.2.5; paperback, Â£1), and a booklet called Chapter 42 and The Goldfinch (Menard Press, 75p). The last-named contains a missing chapter from the memoirs of Mandelstam's widow, plus related poems, all translated by Donald Rayfield. On the subject of translation, buy the volume now handsomely made of Peter Dale's versions of The Legacy, The Testament, and Other Poems of Frangois Villon (Macmillan, Â£6). Villon is hard to translate, as Pound said, because he rhymes on the exact word. Dale does well, going for muscle, bone, and mood and letting the music take care of itself.
Nobody who has read this far with sympathy for my theme of the poet as catechist of order should miss Martin Booth's Coronis (Andium Press, Â£1.85) or the first issue of Poetry Nation (266 Councillor Lane, Cheadle Hulme, Cheshire SK8
SPN, published twice yearly, subscription Â£2.90). Booth constructs litanies of unpromisingly mucky romantic matter, but his grip of his craft, together with a dedication to the making of a sense which will reach beyond reason, give his work a fumbling power:
In this place
Christ nailed wind on the
headstones und watching it howl round tried to shake it loose.
"" Noumenon "", quoted there, is an achievement for a poet still in his twenties. The ""Archdeacon Broix"" sequence, ""Steeple Gidding "", and ""Visit of the Exegete "" are nearly as good, and full of possibilities for future refinings.
Poetry Nation, edited by C. B. Cox and Michael Schmidt, stands I think for grace as much as form. This book-style magazine, out for the first time today, contains poems by C. H. Sisson, Elizabeth Jennings, Donald Davie, Douglas Dunn, Roger Garfitt, Charles Tomlinson, Fleur Adcock, and others committed to poetry as the best linguistic means we have of making sense of our senses. Essays by Schmidt and Davie, Adrian Stokes on "" Psychoanalysis and our Culture "", and a long interview with Edgell Rickword, make this a substantial addition to the present poetry magazine scene. Plainly there is going to be nothing trivial about Poetry Nation.

Can it be seven vears ago that Allen Ginsberg did his celebrated double act with Ungaretti ?
The audiencc is still young, entlusiastic and very large. But the American howle; has lost some more hair fromli the top of his head, and gained some more about tile jowl and chini. Encumbered by crutches, which made access to the podiu- i difficult for him, and still accompanied by his Alystery Wheezer Box he moaned a few disjointed lines about his broken bones from a recent work. Ungar-etti was no longer with us. I fled.
This has been the most various and ambitious season of Poetry International, which can now be regarded as a miniature poetic equivaient of the Proms. Nursed through infancy by Patrick Garland, helped later by Ted Hughes and now in the capable and imaginative hands of Charles Osborne, it was a triumphant week Ginsberg or no Ginsberg. Early on there was a satirical revue mounted by Ian Hamilton and Clive James, dedicated snuffers of any false flame seen to flicker in the poetic firmament, these two television critics reallv do despise a lot of poetry, and their hatred is fashionably ferocious. There were also evenings devoted to libretto, politics and translation all held at Nash El ouse.
turiday aold Saturdayv wse retuliied to the ampler spaces of
the Queen Elizabeth Hall, and to the sight of the festival's patron Bard. W. H. Auden, who has declared that Poetry International is the most important event of its kind in the world. His reading was preceded by some new poems by Vasko Popa. the Yugoslavian of gentle, heraldic mien who, like Cavafy. seems to stand at an angle to the universe-and a slight one to the microphone. It was good to see Patrick Garland back on the platform to read the trans. lations of Popa's dense limpid allegories.
Then came the announced star. Auden, as ever, recited recent work. A hymn to the privacies afforded by English fog, which incorporated unhappily easy references to global gloom to filth and violence; but this gave way to other much finer things: marvelled revelries at the creatures who inhabit our skin
stoical wit about ""a new necessity, death "". And a piece of lambent, polemical doggerel against the motor car.
The greatest impact wvas made by Peter Porter. With the exception of John Fuller (vho has not yet appeared in Poetry International, please note), he is the only younger English poet who treats art with the same awed and loving familiarity that others give exclusively to nature, themselves, or, very occasionally. God. His are concrete poems, not concrete poetry ; his verbal skill is never facile. his feelings are profound his ironies charged with passion. and his sense of the continuous. f ruitful marriage of life and art explodes into poetry.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS151877859/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=3e1dfbeb

Lowells, Cabots and God
Robert Lowell is one of the Lowells of Boston, Mass. James Russell Lowell was his greatgrandfather's brother. Cigarsmoking Amy, empress of imagism, was his cousin. Of nearer and dearer relatives he has spoken in Life Studies (1959). Those guilt-edged ghosts are never far from his inspiration, and any of his books might bear an epigraph from Anon: I come from t)he city of Boston,
The home of thze bean and the cod, Where the Lowells speak only to
Cabots, And the Cabots speak only to God. Critical opinion about Lowell is divided. Some prefer the early rhetoric, where he usurps the function of the Cabots and prays in thumping iambics. Others go for the talkative distress of those 14-line verse-shaped units, in which he sheds skins like veils. Three years ago he published a sequence of these called Notebook. Now he has rewritten hundreds of units from it and serves them up again as History (Faber, Â£2.95) and For Lizzie and Harriet (Faber, Â£1.40). History also contains 80 new units, while The Dolphin (Faber, Â£1.75) consists entirely of fresh work. What all three books offer is a pageant of being Robert Lowell. He is the man, he suffers, he is there. His marriag,e breaks down. His daughter grows up. He chats with T. S. Eliot on a traffic island-about the problems of having famous relatives. When his feelings itch he scratches them, and the blood rhymes. It is possible to respect the open heart surgery while thinking that a necessary pressure has been dissipated in its exercise. All three books are crammed with OK names and up-to-the-minute r eferences. Perhaps every age gets the Lowell it deserves ?
Lawrence Durrell has always been a bit of a Cabot, addressing himself aristocratically to God in the guise of some Mediterranean deus loci. Vega and Other Poems (Faber, Â£1.40) sees him also resuscitating verses, in this case from the recent limited edition entitled The Red Limbo Lingo. The new poems here are sufficiently various to make a worthwhile collection, all the same, with Durrell excelling in that mood of sunburnt anti-nice-
ness which suits him like a pirate's patch:
Always at midnight when I hear the chimes,
I tell myself while pouring out a drink,
Things are less complicated than you think.
Dreams, therefore crimes, honey. . .
The three voices of poetry, as defined by Eliot, allow for God (the poet talking to himself, or nobody), and the Cabots (the poet addressing his peers), but not quite for Peter Redgrove and Penelope Shuttle. Their book The Hermaphrodite Album (Fuller d'Arch Smith, Â£2.50) sounds at first like Eliot's third voice-the poet speaking in an imaginary character to another imaginary character-but as monologue follows spell follows litany, and articulation is given to bones and stones and water and fire, you realise that this is an ambitious oracular attempt to speak in all the voices, and at once. What's more, the individual poems come unsigned, so that no one is to know who wrote what. This could lead to pointless confusion, but it doesn't, because Redgrove and Shuttle, both intensely committed to a way of thinking about the world in images-or, more truly, apprehending and recreating the process of the world in images-seem here to have broken through to a single, several-tongued, pentecostal voice which has little to do with the expression of personality. There's a lot of blood, snot, frogs, jewels, and magicking, but don't let this deflect you into suspicions of surrealism. These two poets are about something sacramental, not decorative:
Heal me, I will wash your feet
Forgive me, I am the sinful lamp
Remember me, I am still bleeding The book bears a vital motto, from Goethe: "" My work is that of a composite being, which happens to be signed."" Each poem in it might be likened to an altar on which gifts of images are offered. But the images have the energy of icons: they become what they represent.
Some of The Hermaphrodite Album remains obscure to me, and repeated readings do little to elucidate the dark places on an intellectual level, yet I would claim that this is a beautiful and important book. Those who look to poetry for spiritual nourishment will find food here. It may not be to their taste, but then the real thing has a way of tasting strange at first.
The magazine Modern Poetry in Translation has been an intelligent enemy of insularity ever since its beginning, 16 issues ago. -he current number, guest edited by Anthony Rudolf, is a bumper book-length job devoted to French poetry (10 Compayne Gardens, London, NWG, 50p). Rudolf's introduction presents a critical view of routes and roots available to English poetry-he directs attention to the work of David Jones and Laura Riding, on the one hand, and to French verse since Mallarme on the other. I am not sure that he has grasped the seriousness of Laura Riding's total rejection of poem-writing as an activity inimical to truth, but he certainly knows his way around the contemporary French scene, and his own translations of such as Jean Paul Guibbert, Alain Veinstein and Yves Bonnefoy are first-rate, and could illuminate contemporary English poetic practice if they obtain the currency they deserve. Also to be commended are Elaine Feinstein's and Graham Martin's versions of poems by Louis-Rene Des Forets, and Rosmarie Waldrop's translation of some difficult texts by Edmond Jabes, who is on this showing unquestionably a major writer. Perhaps Rudolf means only to refer us to Riding's importance in having taken poetry as far as it will go. If that is so, then the French word-adventure which stems from Rimbaud may well provide a parallel alternative worth considering, and this magazine gives a Michelin guide to it, with many good stops in the form of poems. But surely it hasn't escaped Rudolf's notice that Rimbaud gave up poetry also, and went to Africa, where he spoke to neither God nor Cabots, and substituted gunrunning for alchemy ?

The Oxford Book of Children's Verse
Chosen and Edited with Notes by Iona and Peter Opie
(Clarendon Press, Â£2.25)
In the beginning there was coInAsel and exhortation. Manners at table and a care for one's Immortal Soul may not seem to have much in common, but to the earliest writers who directed verse at children they shared one important advantage: a devout honesty of purpose could make up for much deficiency of style (or, as T. S. Eliot said in an altogether different context: ""The poetry does not matter"").
Later, the options widened. In the fifteenth century the grace of a poem like ""Covetousness"" seems a marvellous accident. In the sixteenth century the anonymous ""Unhappy Schoolboy"" catches only briefly the liveliness and wry humour of his tribe, so long accustomed to having their tails peppered ""with good speed"". But as the child comes to figure more in men's -thoughts and sympathies, so, through Herrick and Smart, Ronksley, Marchant and the ever-present anonymous rhymsters, lightness and wit become an acceptable -ingredient. in the child's own verse.
Undoubtedly one of the most welcome features, of Iona and Peter Opie's new anthology is the view it gives of the emergence of what, in terms of craftsmanship, is one of the most delicate and difficult of .all poetic modes. They have not set out merely to assemble a lot of poems that will be enjoyed by children today-the market, happily, is well-stocked with such offerings. Nor have they sought to provide a definitive collection of all that is best (under such terms it would be harfd to justify the inclusion of, let us say, Henry Dixon's ""Descrption of a Good Boy "" and the omission of EDdward Lear's l)ong). Instead they have tried to chart the evolution of the poet's attitude to writing verse special-ly r for children-the object being "" to make available in one place the classics of children's poetry "", while also recognizing that even if these have not always stood the test
of time they were at least ""cherished in their own day "".
Few attempts have been made in the past eo construct
an anthology on quite the same. principles as this, and certainly none ias been compiled with the same care as to chronological arrangement and bibliographical annotation. In consequence it is possible to draw from the collection a fuller sense than before of the -hesitancy, the sententiousness and even the bravura that have all gone into the poet's work in finding a voice for ,t he poem that [he wants to twrite. it is fascinating, for instance, to observe the gradual appearance in -the corpus- of children's poetry of lullabies and ballads, emblems and nursery rhymes. nature poems and poerns imitative of the child's own voice, and then to watch the developrnent or decline of their form. How consistent we seem to have been in prayers and hymns, and what pleasure we have had in standing the cautionary ,tale upon its solemn, unenlightened head.
Furthermore, i.f one takes The Oxford Book of Children's Verse in context with such other books by.its compilers as The Lore and. Language of Schoolchildren or The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes, it is possible to see more. clearly how much the child's education in poetic enjoyment derives from the street songs and graffiti, the nursery rhyimes and playground chabts of npopular tradition. While the experience of generations has b.een enriched by- the incantatory iHow many miles to Babylon "" or the energet,ic "" My mother said "", the earnest adult composer has all too often got stuck in homilies jagainst nosepicking or unconvincing assertions that there are fairies at the bottom of the garden.
For this reason, the cursory treatment of the twentieth century and decision to exclude all living poets Awho have written for children is much to be regretted. In the interests of balance it is just possible to accept the comparatively modest representation of. ICipling and De La Marey Farjeon and Milne, but how much more could have been shown of the persistence of tradition . if Robert Graves.or James Reeves had been allowed a voice ? And what could we have learnt of experimentation, or nonsense, or even of manners, if room had been made for Ian Serraillier, and. Spike Milligan, and the retiring Professor of .Poetry at Oxford?

"Nye, Robert",Poetry and commitment,The Times,1973-Apr-05,"London, England","Poetry and commitment
The first poli*ical poem in English is Piers Plowman. Chaucer was a feudalist, Milton defended regicide, Marvell's satires spawned the Whigs. Shelley sealed his letters with a revolutionary wafer and Blake vore a red cap in the streets at the time of the French Revolution. lIt will be seen that political commitment among poets did not start yesterday. Today, of course, we have Auden disowning his pink past on the grounds that his own poems did not save a single Jew from the gas chamber, but we also have a number of younger poets-not all of them noisy-who would say that this is no reason for not writing poems about the Jews and the concentration camps. Several of the best of these poets have been associated with the quarterly magazine Stand, begun in 1952, which now celebrates its coming of age with an anthology Poetry of the Committed Individual (Gollancz, Â£3.20 hardback, or Penguin, 35p), edited by its presiding'spirit Jon $ilkin.
There is some excellent writing in this book, not least in translation-work by Blok, Voznesensky, Brecht, all in versions by poets.' We almost expect foteign poets to be political, though, and the surprise comes when we encounter a poem as good and as English as Geoffrey Hill's "" Funeral Music "", which makes an anatomy of history while fulfilling both halves of Silkin's clever title, being comniitted and individual. That Hill's subject is the Battle of Towton, 1461, and not Belsen, might have a lesson in it. Could be that it takes poetry about 500 years to translate time into meaning ? Hill's more recent-minded; poem ""September Song ""-bearing the epigraph. ""born *19.6.32, deported 24.9.42 ""-seerfts. to me less achieved, less true. It depends'upon its epigraph, needs this detail,, where C""Funeral Music"" has another kind of capacity: to move the reader to tears-the. caioacity of' being history purified to the' point where it is no loniger the details that appall,'but the total act of 'meaning-' which is the,'poem itself. : , '
I wish Auden were among the contributors to The Hotue That Jack- Btilt edited by Brian Patten'and Pat Krett (Allen & Unwin, Â£2.50; paperback, 85p),
for no other reason than that all royalties from this book go to Shelter, the National Campaign for the Homeless, and that if your poems cannot save lives it might be some comfort to think of them giving roofs.
Forgive the cruder note sounded by contributors here. It seems that some were asked for poems ""expressing the agony of slum life "", others drew inspiration from Shelter's own report "" Condemned "", and in any case it is difficult to keep your temper when -you think of the one and a half million inhabited dwellings in this country which have been officially designated as unfit for human beings.
Besides, if there are poems here which do justice only to the passionate feelings that have unbalanced them, tlhere are. rather more which speak out against injustice and indifference in society with an effectiveness that is certainly not due to rhetoric on behalf of a political party. I am thinking especially of Edwin Morgan's Glasgow sonnets, Philip Hobsbaum's rvecalling of a violently ulrban chlildhood, and George Mackay Brown's Nativity poem which mllakes the opposite of the polit all too often made in sermons.
A new magazine which has nolw run albeit slowly to three issues and grown increasingly dedicated to the question of the moral justification of poetry is the reviewJ Ishmael, edited by Francis Boylan (60p, Librairie de la Presse, 6 Place Clemenceau, 64-Biarritz). The solutions implied by Ishmael go. deeper - than politics or humanitarianism. It seems that here at last-for the first time since Eliot's Criterion ?-is. a magazine which supposes very seriously indeed that if poets are required to "" do good "" then the good which they can best be required to do is pobms..
Early issues, had poems by George Barker, Xathleen Raine, Peter Levi, and C. H. Sisson, as well as *some xictra6rdinarily penetrating critical essays by the last named. The latest has nine unpublished poemg by that excellent poet Patrick Kavanagh, and a long essay on him by Boylan. Ishmel is committed to. ""speech joined to spirit"",; its party is poetry; join it.

The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse
Chosen by Philip Larkin
(Clarendon Press/Oxford, Â£3)
This is a very important book. It contains 584 poems by poets from Wilfrid Scawen Blunt to Brian Patten, and it has no precedent in range or scale. Like all Oxford anthologies it will carry with it something like the force of law, influencing the taste and lives of at least one generation of readers. Like all anthologies of poetry since the world began it will be vigorously strafed by other poets and anthologists wvho feel they could have done better: if the cadres of English poetry have run true to form, you won't see the sky for the shrapnel by next Sunday morning. Fear not, it is perfectly safe to buy The Oxford Book of Twventieth Century English Verse. Mr Larkin has done an incredibly difficult job well.
He keeps his cover. Not for this compiler the barricade stand of Al Alvarez and Michael Roberts, or the imperial tone of the aging Yeats (""I have stood judgment UpoIn Wilde, bringing into the light a great, or almost great, poem. . . . "") In a tiny Preface of less than a page and a half, promising ""w vide rather than deep representation "". Mr Larkin drily states his business and is gone:
I found my materials fell into thlree groups; poems representirng aspects of the talents of poets jiudged either by the age or by myself to be worthy of inclusion, poems judged by me to be worthty of inclusion weithout reference to their authors, and poems judged by me to carry woith them something of
the censti,y in- wlitch tzey were wntten.
That's your lot. It is an indication of procedure rather than a confession of faith. Into Mr Larkin's first group go, aMong amaniy others, "" The Waste Land"" and ""Little Gidding""; ""The Lake of Innisfree"" and ""' Easter 1916""; "" Sea Fever "",, ""Anthem for Doomed Youth"" and ""Do not go- gentle -into. that good night""; Hardy's ""I Channel Firing "", MacNeice's "" Bagpipe Music "" and De la Mare's ""All that's past "":
Oh, no man knows
Throzsgh what wild centtures Roves back t1te rose
Group Two contains good single poems by poets wlho may not have produced a notable oeztvre or by writers whose ilain achievement lies elsewhere: I liked especially Herbert Palmer's splendid "" Rock Pi9grim "", "" The Great Moth "" by Robert Gittings, tlle brillinntly ftnny "" Encounter "" by Edgell Rick-vord and Noiil CoNvard's "" Boy Actor "". Some rather silly poems get in here, too, like Isherwood's C"" On His Queerness "" and Alan Ross's apostrophe to Sir Stanley Matthevs :

More than half the wvork in Tlze Oxford Book of Twentieth Centzury English Verse belongs -to writers borni before 1900. Poets today under the age of 50 account for only 80 of the 625 pages: these figures certainly indicate caution but, considering the astonishing profusion of 20th century talent born in the last 40 years of the 19th century shey should not surprise us nnd I don't think they can
iirly. be described, as they have been, as ""reactionary "". J. C. Squire earns his place, even if Alfred Noyes does not.
Most alitlhologists stake out agnreed lines on the great central territory of Hardy, Yeats, Eliot and Audeni. Beyond that the wvidest opportunities for disagreement are exercised. Larkin adds to his centre Kip-
ling,; Lawrence-and Betieman. The latter's very funny ""Diary of a Church Mouse"" would be welcorie. in any collection of English verse, but he is then extravagantly over^represented by ten further poems, plus a great chunk of Sui77moned by Bells:, he occupies much mnore space than HIousman, MacDiarmid, MacNeice, Graves, Spender or Day-Lewis, and nearly as much as Yeats. I would have willingly traded three or four Beejemans for the inclusion of W. 3L Rodgers and David Jones.
It is impossible to say howv Mlr Larkin's last 80 pages will look after another 15 years; Geoffrey Grigson's own P>oetry of the Present (-1949) gave great prominence to a number of poets-Hubert Nicholson, Derek Stanford, Norman Nqicholson-who have not surfaced by so 'much as a single p,oem in Larkin; and others, like Charles Madge and Druxh-mond Allison, who have only done just that.
I hope that future editions will increase the representation of Basil Bunting (although we already have the magnificent ' Chomei at Toyama"" complete), Donald Davie, and Geoffrey Hill, whilst amending that of Gunn to include at least ""tCarnlal Knowledge "" and ""A Mirror for Poets "" as Alvarez does in Thze Newo Poch-y. But if all anthologists have the duty to include certain poems they don't much like, they also have the privilege of choosing some that hardly anyonle else will. Mdr Larkcin has discharged both duty and privilege with a de'licate lack of rant, and we shall be delightedly in his debt for many years tO come.

Irishmen and others
I met Patrick Kavanagh just once. He told me that he had cancer. lie seemed cheerful about it, pointing out that some Irish officials had awarded him a pension when the disease was confirmed. ""Like a prize each year until I die "", he said. 'The prospect of.cheating officialdom gave him a reason for living. In fact he lived on for five years. r hope the prizes didn't stop.
I have just seen the reprint of his Collected Poems (Martin, Brian & O'Keeffe, Â£1) and realized what a good poet he is. much more various than memories- of the early verse allowed for. This book runs from the. lyrical simplicities about tinkers and blackbirds which he wrote while still scraping a living from a farm in Monaghan, through the long poem about Ireland which made his reputation and brought the police to his door (The Great Hunger), to the parish of gossip about matters df life and death which constitutes the later poems.
Intuitive, epigrammatic, shrewd, Kavanagh is always the peasant, seeing how much he can get away with, returning again and again to a handful of themes perceived as underlying all creation. Here is a complete short poem which gives his authentic flavour, ""Sanctity "":
To be a poet -and not know the
trade,
To be a lover and repel all women;
Twin ironies by which great saints
arie made,
The agonizing pincer-jaws of
Heaven.
Seamus Heaney and Stewart Conn are two younger poets, one Irish, one Scottish, whose work also derives from a strong sense of place. Heaney's Wintering Out (Faber, Â£1 paperback) is impressive for the accurate quality of its observation-snipe "" stagger in air "", a diseased fish turits to face the current and ""its whole head opened like a valve "", cocklebeds on the shore are seen as "" white pocks "" and porpoises cartwheel "" like the flywheels of the tide, /Soapy and shining "".
If your pleasure in poetry favours the felicitous phrase then Heaney is your man; Conn, though, seems to me to have a more complicated and rewarding talent. The poems in An Ear to the Ground (Hutchinson, Â£1 paperback) draw upon Ayrshire and Highland mnemories, and evoke ""the still heron on his stalk "" and so forth, but this poet is after something stranger than activated descriptions and what looks like a book of people and place poems is in effect a book of love poems. The metaphors are found in urban experience too, and those familiar with the peculiar autumnal seediness of Glasgow's West End-all leaves, decaying terraces, and a river which "" runs like stinking lard "" -will recognize the justice of its presence here. Conn frets away at dark states of mind and the heart's unease in terms Iof landscapes .patched with shadow.
Warrior's Career (Macmillan, Â£2), Alan Brownjohn's fourth book of poems, shows him redeploying his faculties to fashion a kind of verse which can deal with what he calls ""beautiful, living ordinariness "". He is a rather smarter, snappier Larkin. Television sets left on in shop windows, black cigarettes, the sadness of barstools-Brownjohn's props are impeccably upto-date, and if just occasionally there is a sense of the objects crowding out the thought there is more often an agreeable ease of manner and reference.
The same goes for George MacBeth, whose latest collection Shrapnel (Macmillan, Â£2) returns to what has always been !the most fertile of his several inspirations-that which occasions in him a style of dandified celebration of odd animals and vegetables : "" To The Master of This Book, The Lord Gorilla "" "" The Lesser Horned Artichoke "", ""The North American Whooping Carrot "", etc. MacBeth even includes a litany, a hymn, and a spell. The Lady Sycorax presides. Whether the poet is posing as Ariel or Caliban is not clear.
Prayers and other offices addressed unplayfully to God make up the substance of John Berryman's posthumous Delusionzs, Etc (Faber, Â£1.50), a book which has upset some critics, quite understandably, by reason of its Christianity.
Let m4e be clear about this. It is
plain to me Christ underwent man & treachlery . ~~~~~& socks & lashes, t72irst, exhaustifon, the bit, for my pathetic & disgusting
This is evangelical to the point of hysteria, but I can see no need to runa for the cover of literary sophistication.. The ambiguity of "" socks "" is even brilliant, in context: does he mean blows and/or the tokens of male humanity we suffer upon our feet ? Christ may be said to have undergone the pain of such trivia, in being made flesh, as well as. the more obvious pain of t'he scourging before the crucifi%ion. Tbheimage is oiily grotesque or bizarre if your knowledge of Christ echludes the contemporary. Donne would not have eschewed it, nor Hopkins, nor foi that ma-tter Patrick Kavanagh.

*Revisiting areas of talent already oerfected
Poems 1970-1972
By. Robert Graves.
(Cassell, Â£1;90)
I love. therefore I am'
Robert Graves's formula, twicegiven, in English and Latin, at the end of a new poem called Five, might well be preferred to the usual Descartian modegty. The difference between loving arfd thinking has always exercised his mind to some tune. Once he wrote poems about. it which exercised the heart also-"" Pure Death "", ""The Cool ,Web "", ""The Terraced Valley "". There is nothing of that quality or intensity in his latest volume of verse, Poems 1970-1972, 79 pieces which are required to add to his Collected Poems (1965) as two sections.
The shape of the love poems in the first section is much what we have come to expect of Graves-events are elegantly examined for their deposit of myth, unanswerable questions are posed, a special rhetoric stands between the poet and his experience. The poems of "" contemporary comment"" are slighter in content, and more obvious in their rhythms.. The book as a whole is testamentary to the manner in which Graves has perfected a formal and satisfying poetic idiom immediately recognizable as his ownand no one should underestimate his craftsmanship, the dues he owes to what he once called ""a devil of verse"" who prompts him how ""to evade the patent clumsiness of truth "". The sadness is in how far that idiom lies from living speech. He sounded better when he stammered more, his heart in his mouth, his head less sure of what it thought it knew.
lain Crichton Smith is a hard poet to pin down with critical tacks. A habit of elusiveness seems second nature to him, not least where he is most local and rooted in his own Scottish landscape. His Hebrides lie perhaps just west of. the human heart, and the deer on his high hills are thoughts. Not that intellect Qr emotions obtrude, but married as they are in his best poems they breed images at a great rate and then he gives a sense o thinking at the nib of his pen, working on the page, writing like Forsteirs old woman in order to see what it is that he wants to say. His new book Love Poems & Elegies (Gol. lancz, Â£1.50) is very much in character, a kind of outpouring checked by craftiness. An unhappy love affair and the death of the poet's mother have provided the inspiration for these pieces, but it seems no injustice to Smith's sincerity to suggest that as shown here those events are occasions for diffusion rather than concentration.
* If Smith had not taken care to inform us of the two wounds, it would have been possible to suppose that all the blood came from one place. All the same, I recommend Love Poems and Elegies as an antidote to all those many modern collections consisting of poems about poems, poems about paintings, and poems translated from other poems. You can. taste the real in Sinith's writing.
You can feast on it (and choke too, if you don't look out) in Peter Redgrove's Dr Faust's Sea-Spirhl. Spirit (Routledge, Â£1.50; paperback, 75p). Here are poems about stones and water and sand and iroll and shadows, poems concerned with entropy and metamorphosis,
poems. so thick in the stuff of the natural world that they make even pantheism interesting-though I wish Redgrove would see the sense of Chesterton's remark that nature is our elder sister, not our mother, and use his mind a bit more to make distinctions between himself and bacon, human love and the force that drives the green fuse through the etcetera. Redgrove's self-identifying with the Protean characteristics of the shape-shifting Welsh mythological hero Taliesin gives the biggest clue to what he is about. Read the book as one long poem, and that poem as an encounter with information about the physical world presented in terms of rhythm. It is certainly exciting.
Philip Hobsbaum's. Women and Animals (Macmillan, Â£2) and R. S. Thomas's H'm (Macmillan, Â£2) will appeal, on the other hand, chiefly to those who already know these poets by better work past-published, for there is an air in both volumes of revisiting areas of talent already perfected-in Hobsbaum's case, the poem of ruthless self-accusation, in Thomas's, the poem to justify the ways of God to Job.
I suggest that Norman Nicholson's A Local Habitation (Faber, Â£1 paperback) or. Donald Davie's Collec,ted Poems 1950-70 (Routledge, Â£3.75) are better buys, the Nicholson because it shows, a good minor poet exploring his patch for the first time in depth, the Davie because it reminds us again of the elegant way he wore his neo-Augustan corset in the good old days of Brides of Reason (1955) and A Winter Talent (1957), singing the sofa and the hare and the difficulty of finding suitable accommodation for the Muse at Cambridge. Stylish manners suited Davie. Alas, he has now moved on.
Style is also the word for the work in Jorge Luis Borges' Selected Poenms 1923-67 edited by Norman Thomas di Giovanni (Allen Lane, the Penguin Press, Â£5), which prints Spanish and English on facing pages and gives us more than 100 of the poems which this master mazemaker considers his best. Borges' talent is essentially for the parable and the puzzle. He has a bibliography where his heart should be. One might be excused therefore for finding the prefaces and notes more intdresting that the verses.
Signs of Life is the first hardcover collection by a 50-year-old Huddersfield schoolteacher, Stanley Cook, whose merits I noticed when he published a pamphlet called Form Photograph last year. This comes from an unfamiliar publisher (E. J. Morten, Â£1.25, Warburton Street, Didsbury, Manchester 20). He writes a flat, unpre. tentious, uncomfortable kind of poem, usually starting in some incident of his own life, or the social history that has shaped him, and. he has the advantage of never being slick or glib, so that the words really work for their keep within the lines, and the awkwardnesses of technique match the unsentimental intensity of what he has to say.
The key poems here are the -ones on Rembrandt and Sheffield, particularly - the six stanzas on "" The Cholera Monument, Sheffield,"" which strike me as remarkable. Cook is earnest, deliberate, and utnderivative, an unassuming poetwho vill probably never be famous;: but I think he is authentic.

phantom hope of warm community, love; direct communication. His poem '""Fears 'in.,Solitude"" .is a rather-. hlystericalpicture of- the' solitary contemplative who has- a pbolitical vision of the close communion of Britain and the British. His. "" Mother Isle melst-'be at once a son, a brother. nd.da friend/A husband and a- 'father"". It i's arguable that most . of his second-rate poems- and' deeplyfelt letters strike)-i'thei same extravagant note-agitated, pleading,' displaying 'his own, insufficiences to some one or some thing which must provide' a :total, ' harmonious response: and forgiveness. His great vork, on- the other hand: either treats of solitary vision,; or, inthe case- of the marvellous, intricate prose of the; notebooks;!has the hardness,jclarity and wit of a mind contemplating' in - solitudet - rawing
strength 'from its own ~solitary ' activity. : In: moments .,.of strength his reality was his own inner life.-
""In looking at. objects - of' Nature- while I am thinking, as. at yonder moon dim-glimmering through the dewy window-pane, I-eem rather-to-be::seeking, as it .Were,, asking, .a symibolical - language for something l within me that already-:'and forever exists, than observing anything new "".
It has"" often, been said' that his- most' persistentv preoccupation was the 'searchi for. unity underlying ' diversity-, -He des-cribes the rapid associative 'process of his own mind '-'with amusing brilliance but' -is always afraid that this mind is simply self-inclosed and selfreferring. Describing in 'a notebook 'one of his own characteristic monologues, he explains that' 'his proliferating illustriations swallow his thesis- and -continues: ' '
'""Psychologically rmy brainfibres, or the spiritual' Light which :abides 'in the, brain' marrow as' -the visible Light
appears to do' in sundry rotten' mackerel and' ofrher -`,smashy matters, is of -too gen'eral an affinity : iiith ' 'all things'/and though it"" 'perceives ' the6'.diffeie

He. Was afraid, too, -that this incessant mental .activityL . muffled the directness of'his vi'siorn.
""0 said I as I'loWked. on- the blue, yellow, green andpurplegreen sea, .with all its hollows and- swells' andi. cut-glass. surfaces-O what an!' ocean Pof lovely forms I and -I . - was teazed, that the sentence sounded like a play of Words. But it was not, the mind, within me was struggling to express the marvellous distinctness and unconfounded' personality of cach of the million millions of forms, and yet the individual unity in which-theyr subsisted.""? ';
Coleridge's& "" Dejectioni"" -- ode is 6ne- or tlie most movi nig pictures of. the. power and failure of the mind in solitude that we have. Wordsworth 'believed that contemplation - of the powers of nature . 4ealed the human mind:. _Coleridge observed the forms--of the outer world, remarked ""I see,, not' feel, how beautiful they are,"" and concluded "" I may not hope from outward forms to win ~The passion and the- life,- whose fountains are within."". The published - pQem -is a condensed, impersonal. version of a. long verse-letter to Sarah Hutchinson. The verse-letter is discursive,: -: plai'-ti -- ;ielfaccusing; pleading, psychologically acute and very moving.' But. the final Ode has gained a new power from.its compression. The contrast between the sharply. -observed, ' alimost - hallucinati""ig outer world of the poerin -and the passive suffering of the solitary. mind is. harsher., and stronger wvithout the thfobbing appeals to Sarah.
In the ""Ancient Mariner
'Christabel-"" and - 'f Kubla Khan"""" the observed 'worlds have a unique . glittering ;jclarity of extreme states' of ' being sunny pleasure dome,' caves of icei burning sun, slimny s6a.'The cential characters: are passive and -suffering, .unibeafably isolated, waiting, at best, to revive - within themselves -tthat symphony and song!"", the vanished, passion and -life l'whose sources are' withini. At' liis.best, Coleridge was aware that the sources of -his pow-er Sand. his intole'rable solitude' were. very close- togethier. e 'was like his * own -mari'ner, condemned tO pluck- the sleeve of the wedding guest -who: was .retufning to-the humnan' feast a'nd -ommtinity,' and hold- hin'- spellbdund with an:. almost. inconprehensible monologue about the torture of the solitary spirit and its transient vision -of the nature of things. - - - -

In Biograp7lia;Literariw Coleeridge described' the idaeF poet as c ombimung,. among.. other things ""a. more than usual state of emotion with more - than usual -ordet 1I uch has been written- about-how, during--this year, he was- aW1e .to fuse years of disparate reach4s, :pÂ§eitfla ttions b ions, into powerf fully- original forms. It seems certain that without Words` -worth he 'might never jihave' found this combined force' of
* . : : ..f
emotion and order. But the source of power was in itself a danger.
Walter Jackson Bate, pointed out percipiently that Coleridge's real sense of the nature and difficulty of. true poetic achievement, combined withl his great critical gifts, must have inhibited him as a poet. His' -ideals- as well as his understanding were high. The ideal great poem should combine all human powers at their highest. In 1797 he wrote: "" I should not think of devoting less than 20 years to an Epic Poem. Ten to collect materials and warm my mind'with universil science. I would be a tolerable Mathematician, I would thoroughly know Mechanics : and Hydrostatics, Optics and 'Astronomy, Botany, Metallurgy, Fossilism, Chemistry, Geology, Anatomy, Medi-. cine-then the mind of man, then the.minds. of men--in. all Travels, Voyages and Histories.
So-- would spend. ten years-s the ne~xt five to the composition
of the poem-and. the five last to the correction of it.""

Restoring passion, grandeur and public life in poetry
The New Oxford Book of Enelish Verse
Edited by Helen Gardner
(Oxford, Â£3.25)
T. Sturge Moore is gone, with his flowers nodding gaily, scent in air. Gone, too, the Scoutish exhortations of Henr y Charles Beeching (b 1859) and William Watson's horrid little ""Song"": April, April,
Laugiz tlhy girlish laughter; Then, tl2e moment after, Weep thy girlish tears!
The inclusion of such poets and their work in Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch's original Oxford Book of English Verse (1901) reflects less on Q's particular judgment-though he favoured the faery-than on one basic problem facing every verse anthologist: the treatment, if anly, of contemporaries whose work is still in progress. Q's 1939 revision still contained no Eliot, and the only general survey to presemt the twentieth century fairly and squarely in
the context of its predecessors has been John Hayward's Penguin Book of English Verse (1956)-excellent, but with 450 poems in all, offering a limited selection.
Dame Helen Gardner's New Oxford Book of English Verse starts again from scratch, includes less than half of Q's choice, is twice as long as Hayward, and brings English poetry up to the last war. At which point she draws a fairly firm line, declining either to take Q's risks or to hedge bets like Palgrave: Fuller si Larkin no. She takes Hardy, Hopkins, Yeats and Eliot as the four major poets of the last hundred years and gives ample representation to each: 22 poems by Hardy, 11 by Hopkins (including "" The Wreck of the Deutschland"" complete); 16 by Yeats; and for Eliot six, a misleading number since it includes The Waste Land and ""Little Gidding"" uncut.
For the rest, MacNeice is clearly her favourite and ringingly speaks the Epilogue to the whole book, with his ""Fanfare for the Makers"" who preceded
him: ""To make is such. Let us make."" I regret Dame Helen's exclusion of Auden's marvellous "" 1st September 1939 "" (Hayward has it) but she retains the magical "" Lullaby "" and, true to MacNeice's "" cloud of witnesses "", suggests the common tradition that unites their testimony with two other Auden poems""Musee des Beaux Arts "", with its reverberance of Browning, and the grand funeral ode for Yeats:
Follow, poet, follow right
To thze bottom of thze night,
With your unconstraining voice Still persuade us to rejoice.
The common tradition: to rejoice, to celebrate, to argue, to persuade. The most stimulating aspect of Dame Helen's selection is the gloriously positive view it offers of the English poetic achievement: her poets stand up and are counted. To develop and balance this view she has omitted American verse entirely -presumably Oxford will publish a large nmodern selection in due course--and she has rejected that declared preference for the lyrical which inspired all earlier anthologists.
It is not too much to say that she has revolutionized the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries entirely. The representation of Spenser and jonson is up 50 pei- cent ; of Donne, Herbert, Dryden, Blake, Byron, Tennyson and Rossetti it has doubled; there is five times more Pope than in 1901 (16 poems, or extracts from poems, as against three). Many of these changes, of course, reflect common twentieth century shifts of taste and reputation; more significant, because less immediately obvious and more personal to Dame Helen's historic theme, is the radical reordering of choice within the work of a poet whose numerical representation remains roughly the same.
L'Allegro and 11 Penseroso, for example, are replaced by three dramatic extracts from Paradise Lost Books I, IV and XII and by ""On the Late Massacre in Piedmont "", Milton's far from pastoral reaction to the murder of the Waldensians in 1655, a superb piece of State poetry by which Cromwell sought to rouse the conscience
of Protestant Europe - "" Avenge, 0 Lord, thy slaughtered saints. . ."". Compare this with Shelley on England in 1819: "" Rulers who neither see, nor feel, nor know / But leechlike to their fainting country cling "".
Dame Helen honours the forthright, the poet who speaks his mind not merely to his fellow-citizens, but to his lover and to God. There is more great love poetry and religious verse here than in any previous anthology and, perhaps because they excelled at both, Donne and Dry. den are its first heroes. Sir Arthur was a gentle knight, shied away from Donne's ravish. ing God, from the button-holing prayers and the kingly proclamations of love and marriagebed; he interrupted ""Ecstasy"" after five stanzas, thus reducing it to the merely pretty: none of those body-and-soul meetings for him.
Dryden he clearly thought of as a Restoration intimiste and charming versifier. In restoring to us Dryden's grandeur and passion, Damne Helen rejects that picture perhaps too thoroughly, but we do now have the withering attack on Shadwell and those on Shaftesbury and Buckingham in Absalomn and Achitophel, the generous tribute "" To the Memory of Mr Oldham "", all of Alexander's Feast, and the extraordinary vision of London's mercantile millennium arising from the ashes of the Great Fire.
Pope had one poem-the short "" Solitude ""-in Palgrave's Golden Treasury, and it is astonishing that even Q should have ignored "" A little learning is a dangerous thing"" and ""Know then, thyself, presume not God to scan "". But Pope was above all the poet of public life and such a man meets the needs of our own time and
Pope: a central figure
his own rather than the century in between. The whole mighty. glittering and unpleasant sequence is here. Pope's place in The Newv Oxford Book of English Verse is not merely a chronological one: he is central to it in every possible way.
The rehanging of Wordsworth, on the other hand, is a little odd: we gain, predictably, more Prelude and the poem to Toussaint l'Ouverture, but we lose most of the sequence Q called "" England, 1802 "" which, invoking Milton and anticipating Shelley, Eliot and Auden, might have been thought to exemplify Dame Helen's vision of the poet as prophet to perfection. Blake, Byron, Tennyson and Browning are all encouraged to fire their heavy guns again, to greater effect. And so to Arnold and Hardy and Hopkins: the poet in public, the poet in love and the poet with God.
It should be stressed that, whilst this is a personal and didactic anthology it is also by far the most balanced and most wide-ranging we have, offering superlative value to almost every taste. It is generous to poets-like Wyatt, Campion, Housman or Edward Thomaswho might not be swimming down its great central stream. Its attention to detail is a delight: it takes good care to answer Goldsmith's too-familiar Deserted Village with the magnificent Crabbe, and to counter Mordaunt's ""Sound, sound the clarion, fill the fife ! "" with John Scott's angry lament on the human wastefulness of eighteenth-century conscription. It is never solemn.
Let the end lie with one of the humbler witnesses: Winthrop Mackworth Praed (1802-1839). Journalist, barrister and member of Peel's first Cabinet, Praed was a vigorous versifier. Or so one sees now: Q represented him with an exceedingly wet "" Fairy Song "", but Dame Helen knows what barristers and MPs are about, even versifying ones, and, with Praed's "" Good-night to the Season ! "", she effects a three-page rescue which sweeps the reader off his feet.

Guide, 1972
The New Oxford Book of English Verse, known prosaically to its intimates Rs ANOBEV, is published today, daughter of the classic anthology that has sold nearly 900,000 copies in two editions since 1900 and pupped a prolific and.handsome litter of other Oxford boqks of poetry of different periods and countries.
The process of selecting such an anthology has been changed radically since Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch made his choice of "" the best "" English verse written between 1250 and 1900, which at the time seemed durable enough to outlive m'arble, the gilded monuments of princes and the shifting taste of fashion. Three fatctors, at least, have combined to change it. First, another 50 years, exceptionally rich and r-evolutionary in poetry, have passed. Secondly and even mote significantly, the map and perspective of poetry have been entirely redrawn by Eliot, Pound and thle modern movement. Thirdly, the selecting has been done this time not by Sir Arthur but by Helen Gardner.
The Merton Professor of English Literature at Oxford has as fine an ear and as deep a learnIng and love for poetry as Sir Arthur, but she is a child~ of her generation and has her indivdual and strong tastes.
in any such collection of ""the best "" (the phrase has to be shrouded -in inverted commas these self-conscious days, or it seems priggish), of the fadeless flowers of English verse, about half the entries choose themselves. It simply has to include h-hall I compare thee to a summet's day ? and, regrettably some may think, Hail to thee, Blithe Spirit. The next quarter of the entries in the new anthology are not unexpected. The idiosyncrasy of the anthologist shines in the' lat quarter.
When Sir Arthur made his selection, he deliberately restricted himself to numbers "" either- lyrical or epigrammatic"", following in the- footprints through the dewy meadows of lyric of that other great Victorian anthology, Palgrave's Golden Treasury. This restriction entailed little Donne, less Pope, no Swift, and the representation of poets such as Dryden, Byron, Tennyscn and Browning solely by their lyrics. It meant leaving out such famous poems, characteristic of their authors' best work, as Ulysses, My Last Duchess and Dover Beach.
Sir Arthur's idiosyncrasy also allowed him sometimes to prefer ""the more beautiful to the better attested reading ""; and he did not scruple to excise weak or superfluous stanzas, without mentioning what he had done, "" when sure that excision would improve "".
Times and tastes have changed. Dame Helen Gardner won her scholarship to St Hilda's in 1926 wvith papers on Donnp and Milton, poets usually .supposed to be antipathetic. Her, reputation as one of the most perceptive and witty of the twentieth-century scholars of English literature is largely founded on her editing of Donne and her critical writings about Eliot, whose- work she has always loved (her book includes the whole of The Waste Land and Little Gidding).
Dame Helen was invited to select and edit the book about 10 years ago. Just as this happened she was commissioned to write'several other books and to serve on the Robbins Committee on Higher Education. But in her spare time, in what she describes unpersuasively as a desultory way, she started to re.read all the poets and to make preliminary collections of, for ex-ample, 40 poems by Hardy, which would eventually have to be reduced by half
Then about two years ago she vas awoken in the black and
startled middle of the night'by a telephone call, fortunately not from The Times but from: The Guardian. The wretched, rash, intruding reporter said: "",This is very exciting news that you have been chosen to pick the New Oxford Book bf Eiiglish Verse. Is it true ? P'
Dame Helen was very angry. She .harbours a. suspicion that the call was a plot by the Clarendon Press to force her hand and accelerate her progress. In fact the call did propel heo into the finial stage of preparation of the book on a Hellenic- cruise in 1970. During this-she played a game with the literate crew of passengers and lecturers to be found on such a voyage, by asking them to name'10 poems that wvere not famous but.that they would be sorry not to see included in the Oxford. book. She was pleased to find a rneasure of agreement. Her high quest had 'also been discussed. and the, choices argued through common rooms and the drawing rooms of north Oxford for years.
In September 1971 Mrs Bridget Bertram offered her services as research-. assistant. Final choices' were made.' The complicated mechanical work of checking texts, counting. lines, tracing sources and prepaiing copy for the -press so neatly that no stanza is cut in half by a page was completed in a year; even though Dame Helen had to spend five weeks in. hospital for an operation oh her hip. The new book is the same length as ""Q's"" revision of 1939, but in physical shape it is longer, more elegant, less squat.
Dame Helen has a conspicuous taste for satire: She also takes the view that a chrono: logical anthology ought to show the reaction of great poets to great events. So she has made room for such series of recurrent themes as Dryden on .the Great. Fire, Eliot on firewvatchers, and MacNeice and Dylan on the Blitz. She particularly regrets that she could not find room for how well Horatius kept the bridge in the brave days of old, but it is such a long poem. Browning, oddly enough, was easy. Of all her choices she is most unhappy, she says, about Kipling. She wanted to have in Queen Elizabeth at her mirror and How far is St Helena from a little child at play ? ""But how- can you leave out Recessional ? ""
She would like to have included more moderns, but by the, time she had done justice to Yeats, Hardy, Hopkins and Eliot, she was pressed for space. She decided not to pick poems written after 1950 for twVo reasons: first, . she considers that the anthologist should wait until a poet's oeuvre is complete, or she may misrepresent him ("" Q "" fell into that hazard with Yeats) secondly, ""My taste becomes uncertain as I grow older. I do not react so strongly to new material or distinguish as clearly as I did. I have a letter fronm Eliot saying that this happened to one "".
She appears. to know her diverse and beautiful selection of flowers by heart, quoting them with an affection and fire that indicate that her taste is as sure as ever.
NOBEV will inevitably' find its way by school prize-givings, Christmas presents and personal shopping into hundreds of thousands of shelves. Whether it is the only book of poetry in the case, or is surrounded by rank on rank of other poetry, it wvill be an ornament and a luminary there, a constant. source of sweetness and light and wit.'

"Alderson, Brian",Reasons for few rhymes,The Times,1972-Oct-04,"London, England","Children and books
Reasons for few rhymes
Nursery rhymes past, the truffles dug from Stevenson and Walter de la Mare, where next do children go for their poetry? How often is there an effqkrtless transition between the rhymes of childhood, which come (and stay) with such complete naturalness. and the serious poetry of the adult world in those stout volumes bought by libraries and those slim editions limited to 40 copies ?
The dead hand of ""education"" is perhaps partly to blame for our growing up to be a nation indifferent to poetry (what, after all, can be worse than Chaucer taught for the sake of the syllabus ?). And perhaps there is a cumulative reaction at work too-for parents and teachers who dislike poetry are not best able to encourage a liking for it among their children. But another reason that has been cited from time to time is simply the dearth of books. The number of poets who have successfully modified their art for children is nothing like the number of novelists, and the children progressing from a natural enjoyment of Hilaire Belloc or Old Possum have too often had to find a way through unprepossessing ""treasuries"" or ""collected works "", which obscure the too few exciting anthologies and single volumes that will keep their enthusiasm alive.
Like nature, though, publishers abhor a vacuum, and the past year or two has seen a marked increase in the number of books of original verse specially written for children. In the past few months this increase has -almost reached the
proportions of an avalanche-- well over a dozen new books and collections having been published-and the sheer quantity of poems raises questions as to the limits of the possible in writing verse for children.
Card Lockhart Smith, in one of the happiest vblumes of the glut, Riding to Canonzbie (Hamish Hamnilton, £1.25),, has kept close to. the experience of her audience by extending and developing the style and rhythms of the nursery rhyme so that her new words and new imaginings do not seem unfamiliar. Her book is cast as an alphabetical sequence of characters ("" Ahnabel Avalon "" to ' Zebediah Zidcup "") and its success is pointed up by com-, paring her easy, friendly lines with those which George Barker offers us in a like sequence of animals, Alphabetical Zoo (Faber, £1.30). Mr Barker probably has slightly older children in view than does Miss Smith, but this leads to loss rather than gain, in that he seems to--see it as an excuse for clumsy rhythms (which may have been intended to be subtle) and for jokes which are either-forced or else fired briskly over the reader's head.
The poet whose poetry is normally written in expectation of an adult readership often seems to be unsure of his voice when he turns intentionally towards children. This may be of little account with writers like Ogden Nash and David McCord. who have both had new books recently published in this country, and who make few claims, to be anything more pretentious than verbal entertainers, but a poet of the stature of Roy Fuller is altogether more demanding.
His recent collection, Seenz Grandpa Lately ? (Andrd Deutsch, 1.15), is something of a miscellany-some "" poems that children might like ""-cbmposed occasionally over the last few years and now brought together. Certainly none is em-
barrassing in the way that, say. George Barker's "" Rhinoceros "" is, but there tends' to be a gap between simplicity of intention and the sophistication of its final expression. When Roy Fuller ceases to be too directly conscious that children may be reading his verses (as in ""The Dream '. ""Happy Lion "", "" The Courts"") he. finds a balance between thought and word which paradoxically shows the young reader the possibilities of poetic statement. Elsewhere, though, except for some nice jokes, it is difficult to see the child always keeping pace with the professor.
Nowhere, however, does faith in children's response to poetry seem more optimistic than in Chatto & Windus's new series of ""Poets for the Young "", edited by Leonard Clark (whose editorial policy does not seem to be sufficiently definite for it to appear anywhere but on the book-jacket). Two volumes in this series by Michael Baldwin, Hob and Othler Poemzs, and by R. S. Thomas, Yolng and Old (65p each), will certainly present 'an imaginative challenge to young readers"", but it is hard to believe that the poems "" have been written especially for children"". Writing like thisstrong, brusque, ellipticaloffers none of the concessions that make Grandpa a slightly tentative book. At this point, the only criteria for judgment that will do are those for poetry
tolut court.-
* The new book by David McCord is Mr Bidery's Spider Garden (Harrap, £1.40) and the two by. Ogden Nash are The Aniinal Garden and The Crutise of the A ardvar-k (Andre Deutsch, 9p each). Deutsch have also just published Marko's Wedding, a collection of ballad poems by. Ian Serraillier, who is a pastmaster at jerking traditional idiom into a speech pattern that is very much his own.

Vladimir Nabokov:
Poems and Problems
(Weidenfeld & Nicolson f2.95)
Nabokov made a precocious namo for himself in poetry long before embarking on novels, and has continued (with declining frequency) to turn to it ever since. Less extraordinary than his prose, his poetic oeuvre is none the less important and varied-perhaps too varied, since there are unevennesses of tone and taste (in the earlier work especially) which show through even in this small selection. Gradually overcoming adroit but vapid eclecticism, by the 1930s he had developed a powerful vein of ""miniature myths "", lucid yet disturbingly awry visions-worthy to stand beside those of his coeval Leningrad "" absurdists "". The latest (1967) and most limpid pQem in this collection is for me the finest.
The poems ate followed by 18 chess problems: included not so as to pad out a thin volume, but programmatically, as a "" corollary "" to the verse. It wvould be presumptuous for an amateur solver to assess their merit, but they are entertaining (and instructively annotated), wvhile one or two show the expected mailed fist in velvet glove. Yet they sit uneasily with the poems they are to complement: the twvo art-formns are manifestly different, much as Nabokov would desire their similarity, and eager as he is to solicit our attention for the task of the creator in both cases.
For the specialist this book has an extra dimension of great interest; Nabokov has courageously translated his own Russian poems into English. As a polemical theoretician of translation he has done much good in challenging the usual weak rhymed paraphrase of "" poetic ' versions: but his own ideal of ""iiterality "" or "" rigid fidelitv""
poses problems which ho does not seem willing to face. Fair enough to proclaim that, from the bundle of elements constituting a poem, only a few can be imitated, and among these prose sense has primacy; another matter to treat literary translation as if it were not irrevocably itself a literary activity.
Concealed "" literary "" touches are in fact ubiquitous in these versions; because they are not consistently integrated, the results are often banal or embar-assint. There are many deft tums of phrase, but these are counterbalanced by the moments when one has to consult the lucid Russian to clarify the obscurities of the English. His proclivity for inventing words ("" racemosa "") or adopting extravagant locutions is a harmless, even amusing literary fad, but runs quite counter to Ihe pretensions of a basically impossible literality
Such awkwardnesses (particularlv rhythmic) in the translations make one suspect simple lack of ear for the cadences of English verse. Yet this is belied by the fluency (once or twice marred by wordiness) of the fourteen English-language poems, which makc a pleasantlv lighthearTed episode in this strange, contradictory but alvays interesting volume. These are sometimes Betjemanesque, sometimes surrealoccasionally ("" An Evening of Russian Poetry "") mnemorable and moving.
Detractors of Nabokov wNill detect in this volume much archness, pedantry and self-congratulation. his supporters will relish its wvit and self-assurance. The uncommitted may well find it perplexingly inconsistent. but in its vcry unevennesses should discern a welcome human quality, softening our usual image of Nabokov the faultless and impersonal coniuror.

The Lost Ones
By Samuel Beckett
(Calder & Boyars, Â£1.40)
The Lost Ones is Samuel Becketi's own translation of a text which appeared in French for the first time last year under the title Le Depeupletir. It consists of 14 paragraphs. The first 13 were written in 1966; the last, consisting of sentences observably less coherent than what has preceded them, was added in 1970. The whole may therefore be considered as a work predating those other abbreviated texts, Ping and Lessness, which Beckett has published in recent times. In content it seems rather to belong with imaginationi Dead Imagine.
"" Abode where lost bodies roam each searching for its lost onc."" That is the opening semence. One notes the cunning, the wordwitchery, the Irishness. All those long and short Os. Beckett seems unable to stop himself achieving ihis kind of rhetorical glamour wvhen he brings anything into English, try as he will.
There is inlernal evidence here that he does not try hard enough. The word strid tlence occurs tNvice, on page 3S and again in the penultimate sentence. I he associations are correct in that the word is used of insects. Crickets and grasshoppers are stridulous, meaning that they produce a shrill, grating sound. But the action of the verb to stridulate is defined in the OED only as stridilarion. sfridulous,zess or sbrididlency, and the third of these is observed to be both obsolete and rare. Beckett is caught redhanded in a piece of poetry. He has coined his s!rideldence because it sounds better in context than the correct usage.
The initial sentence, quoted above, is interesting also for its romanticism. There is a tension throughout the text between a mood which could be called wet and a mind which seeks assiduously to give every appearance of dryness. A place is described. It is the inside of a cylinder. In the cylinder are persons (including a white-haired woman with a child which is referred to as a ,iiie). and ladders, and niches and tunnels. There is a dearth of f'oor space. There ire vibrations. Copulations occur. T-he reader may wobble between wondering if he is being invited to contemplate limbo or the Masters and Johnston sex laboratory. However, a lack df action suggests that the latter is unlikely.
Dante is mentioned a little way into the second paragraPh. Like that poet, Beckett has laboured to find working structures for
things difficult to think '. 1 here are other resemblances, and I hazard a guess that when all these residua are put togetlher it may be seen that Beckett has been about a piece of disquisition the more metaphysical for its insistence on a symmetry of arrangements, for its mention of incidents which are nol permitted to modify a narrative of ideas, and for its rather musical method of progress. The Lost One.s is not the first Beckett text which has borne as it were the air of being a kind of conical footnote to the Comnmedia.

Commonwealth verse. It sounds like a spedies of influenza and often it is. The wildly hospitable Australian Poetry 1971, for instance (Angus & Robertson, Â£1.50), contains little of interest. ""Hell take freak poetres; I like good verse"", declares one ultra-robust contifibutor, anmous aBs are so many of his compatriots to prove that his culture is in the right place, 'but wth some few exceptions the poems included here are neither f-reakish nor good, jst sad indications that the English I anthologies of the fifties have at
last ireached Australia by sea-mail and been swallowed whole.
Judith Wright's "" Hal-%way "" i s one of the exce,p6ons, a poem sooted in somathing peculiarly Australian, exercising its wit on the local event to confirm more general and important possibilities;
,t saw a tadpole once in a sheet of
ice
(a freakist Joke played by my
couitry s weather). He hung at arrest, displayed as it
were in glass, an illustration of neither one thing
nor the other. The tadpoiles are busy thro,ughout the book, alas for the most part with pens instead of tails, writing vea-ses iThustrative of nothing much save the faet Ihat the English language won't quite fit the Australian landscape. Peter Porter looks high-lass in this company.
The editor of Australian Poetry, Chris Wallace-Crabbe, turns up again with a book all his oxvn, Where the Wind Came (Angus & Robertson, Â£1.50), as does another contributor, Roland Robinson, with Selected Poems (Angus & Robertson, Â£1.25). Robinson has an engaging line in flora and fauna and aboriginal myths, but the first line of the first poem
runs "" I made my verses of places where I made n.:v Fires "" and manufacture is indeed apparent everywhere, the poems so many fancies constructed upon observation. Wallace-Crabbe spares us at least the stockwhip and the swag (see Robinson's "" Grendel "" for perhaps the most inappropriate employment of these properties ever); his is a more sophisticated, various, and subtle voice.
The variety seems a bit bewildering. How many WallaceCrabbes are there ? The better poems are possessed by a single speech-rhythm, however, and among these I'd count "" Evening at San Miguel"" and ""Signs ""-a delicate tribute to Paul Klee-as wholly successful. Elsewhere his inventiveness certainly subserves a serious intent, but the effect is ventriloquial.
Turninsg from Australia to Canada, it is a pleasure to note
the devotion to poetry of FTed Cogswell, a university professor in Now Brunswick, wvho ran a little magazine single-handed in that couatry for 14 years and since 198I1 has iploughed back much of his salary into the publishing of Fiddlchead Poetry Books, completelv without subsidy or other official encouragement. I have to admit that l can't always see the merit in the verse he publishes, but the two latest books from this source are wvorth seek:ing out. These are Cogswell's own The Chains of Lillipat and More Poems by Gil Orlovitz. both obtannable direct from the publisher at the Departmen;t of English, University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, Canada, the former costing 50 cents and the latter two dolLars. Cogswell writes an attractively unpretentious poetry obviously inspired by personal expe6ience.
There is nothing flushed or verbose about him, and his ambition rarely exceeds his abilities. Orlovitz, on, the other hand, takes on the world in poem after poem, and the effect is occasionally as incong-ruous as po.or John Clare in the madhouse imagining he was "" Boxer Byron, made of iron "" The intcrcsLing thing about Orlovitz, thoxugh, is that in the thick of a war of images you suddenly find him making straightforward statements of the most qpeaceful simplicity, as at the end of this sonnet about his mother's death:
The oxygen's turning grey, she said, my feet are down to earih. she said, and tnrning black-I can dye my shoes black, she said, and walk alongside my hearse, she laugihed. She recogniized ine from photographs.
Orlovitz needs to be read in bulk. This way, the darkest of his poems throw light on each other.
William Plomer, born in South Africa nearly seventy years ago, has never exhibited that kind of cxuberance characteristic of other South African poets such as Roy Cqmpbell and David Wright. He is a careful, even an arid, Ironist, at his finest in the social satires which he disguises as balladds. His new book Celebrations (Cape, Â£1) contains a number of fastidious exercises on public themes, and a handful of more pemonal and gentle poeTns, mostly in looser conversational rhythms, amongst which ""No identity"" is remarkable. Plomer's indifference to modishness is refreshing.
Plain, precise, but informed by a dispassionate decency, Celebrationis, which is the Spring choice of the Poetry Book Societ, makes an honourable postscript to Plomer's Collected Poems (1960).

Literature and Religion-8 T. S. Eliot
By Valerie Pitt
There is. or was antil Mrs Eliot published the early drafts of The Wasteland (Faber, Â£5) last year, an orthadox doctrine about Eliot. He is the "" invisible poet "", the ansi-romantic whose emoti,ons and personality are never allowed to intrude into this poetry. He evokes. as. in The Wasteland and The Hollowv Men. the crisis *common to all of us in the decay of Western Christendom:
Thtis is the wvay the world ends
Not with a bang but a wvhimper.
But Eliot writes onrly as spectator. He is his own Tiresias, a tired prophet compelled to endure and record even,ts in which he has no personal part. This austerity extends to his Christian writing. No one reads Eliot (or do they ?) as we read Herbert or Hopkins, as a devotional or. still less, as a confessional poet.
To youn,ger generations Eliot's Christianity beloengs to his rolc as tired prophet. It served, like the mountain to Moses, as a standing place to view-judgeand shelter from the confusions of his generation. There is something in this. Eliot did not become a Christian un,til 1927. when he was nearly 40, had already published The Wasteland and had edited The Criterion for nearly five years. He had, long before, abandoned his ancestral Unitarianism for a quiet agnosticism acd an interest in Eastern religions. He had considered but, so it is said, did not adopt the
Buddhist Way because Buddhism has no r.oots in Western culture. If this was his true reason it is very significant. For in the early 1920s Eliot was preoccupied both in his criticism aid in the editorial policy of The Criterion with the roots of Western culture, with sustairving "" tradition "", the order and wisdom inherited from the past which both nourished individual talent and kept - undisciplined squads of emotion "" in decent check:
Extreme High Church Anglicanism, the religion he did adopt, provided the exact religious compleme.mt of these literary concerns. It was, for historical reasons; obsessed in the 1920s and 1930a with questions of ecclesiastical author-ity and tradition: ritual, dogma, discipline, and certainly anv unruly squads of religious emotion, were all to be measured against the inheritance or fanoied iniheritance of the Christian past. Contsidering this, generations to whom "" trad "" is primarily a jazz term. may wvell ask if Eliot adopted Christianity at least partly hecause it was a coniservative force. one way of holding togethet the disintegrating heritage of European civilization ?
The disguised High Toryism of The Idea of a Christian Societv gives coloir to such a view, one which it is now difficult to sustain, unqualified, in the light of Mrs Eliot's edition of The Wasteland. There the ""invisible poet"" begins to materialize behind the tired prophet. Mrs Eliot repeats her husband's assertion that the
poem was not about decaying civilizations: it was about himself and was written in a period of prolonged personal suffering. The waste, infertile land may belong to universal myth : here it reflects Eliot's own state and indeed the unamended poem has a startling qua{ity of personal anguish. And if the poet is present, in his owvn person, in The Wasteland, why not i.n the Christian pooms !
The Four Quartets are, obviously concerned with ""Time present and time past "", "" both perhaps present in time future "", an.d with the way in which history finds new meaning and reality in our consciousness of the present. Even prayer, especially in Little Gidding, belongs to the tradition
You are here to kneel
Where Prayer has been valid
Having said that, however, we have to recognize that history in the Foutr Qutartets is not just any history: it is the history of a particular consciousness, Eliot's, come alive and aware in places which had art ancestral or a personal significance for him, whore he could drawv on an accumulated awareness built up through many generations:
not the life time of
one man only But of old stones whicit
cannot be deciphered. It is i.n Eliot's personal experience that the past and the present come alive in each other and are particularly vital in his con-version to Christ, in whose Incarnation history opens into eternity..And it is because of this relationship
between Christ's etermity and the moments of history, that Eliot is able to mnise the Christian story for myths of his own spiritual progress. As he was Tiresias in The Wasteland, so he is the Magus in the Journey of the Magi and Simeon in A Song for Simeon. Both the last two poems remember a long comning to the event of Christ's birth, the moment of difficult revelation which seperated the new life from thei.r own prasts. Both endure anticlimax: there is a time after as well as a time before the moment of revelation which remains unillumined by the drama of rapture or martyrdoni.
The more personal Eliot is, the more he speaks directly to ouT condition. Because he is the Magus, so are we: we transfer the universalized symbol from the poet's state to our own and read hiTn. yes, as a devotional poet. I mean as a poet who deepens understanding of our life in Christ. What is more, in spite of the anti-climax, the sense of an apparently insignificant before and after, the poetry speaks of his search in history for the meaning of life and of his experience, "" fell in the blood and felt along the heart"", of what he found in the Christian tradition. The event, the birth which gives meaning to the flux of things had happened. There is order, there is hope:
Let me Resign my life for this life,-
my speech for that inspoken The awakened. lips parted,
the hope. the new shins.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS236680840/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=64aa8384

The neck of :eloquence
poetry in England seems a small -arld. Within a random selection of recent volumes, we find George Barker, author of one book, praising Jeff Nuttall on the dustJacket of another, and Alan Bold dedicating his new work to Barry Cole, who also has a new work. In a poem by Tomr Pickard we meet Nuttall again:
as I was running up
the dowtn escalator I passed Jeff Nuttall running down the utp. What this suggests is not so much a coterie as a certain poverty, a scarcity of landmarks, and this is precisely the impression the poetry makcs: It is stranded, bewildered stuff for the most part, floundering among old habits of theme and diction, and making forays into new lands only to get stuck in nornscnse or self-importance. Both Jon Silkin and Nuttall, for example, recognize the problem, make serious attempts to escape into harder, sharper visions. But then their lartuage simply congeals into harshness. odd syntax, strange uses of wnVvrn words:
Its bridnlides emerged, multiplying
densely, conzparing an opa4ue bud of wood and leaves
rnot chItzklng light through, or air; populous of
itself, impacted T*hese Lines, by Silkin, seem to me xrfeadatble, and like t1be rest of Amana Grass (Chatto/Hogarth Sp), horribly strained, trying much too hard. Nuttaill huas finer things, a lot more energy end inven,tion to start with, bbut there, is the same fall into congestion: ""Blood stands acid/At a faccid VYelid . What b'igins in Ntuxta'X as a cry, a response to a creeping menace hidden all over the world becoMes just a tendency to shout (Poemzs 1962-1969, Fulcrum Press f 1.60).
Maureen Duffy, by ooatrast, murmurs nOicely. The Venuz Toazi,h (Weidenfeld and Nicolson 90p), full of echoes of Donne, Marvell, Shakespeare, touches of Dylan Thomas, is elegant, charming and all too easy to read. lt seems half unconscious Or its mlany borrowv-
ings from dead poets, and quite unconscious of any need for a poet to face the asperities of reality now and again. These are love poems, and.a modern love which flows so sweetly into such smooth language either has been betrayed by the verse or is itself a fraud.
Alan Bold manages some briighter, less literary love poems ("" Talk to me now/Instruct me how/Muah my World is the world she has ""), and some fluent translation's, but 4 Pint'of Bitter (Chaatto and Windus Â£1) is curiously without a centre, even without an edge, and totters between virtuosity and flatness. Auden is clearly Bold's master here, and Bold can do a lot of the things Auden can do. But this is Auden without his wit and compression, 'and I'm not sure what is left wvhen those things are gone.
The common difficul.ty in all this work, perhaps in all verse which is not simply metrical, is to qiicken language into a life not possessed by daily prose, and the most obvious solution is an arty word order or "" poetic ' invention: a bed Tiepoloed with sunrise (Maureen Duffy), a pavanne of daffodils, the gavotte of the grass (Alan Bold), the spastic fandangos of love (Jeff Nuttall). But these are fake answers, evasions of the issue, mere decorations. of our drabness. and I want to turn now to some authentic solutions.
It is possible, for example, for a sensibility to pin and for potential damage to be so strong that it simply takes languiage into its service, and this is the case with Elaine Feinstein (Tiae Magic Apple Tree, lutchinson Â£1.50). She is a poet of small moments which take on meaning not because they are great events in disguise but because they mark patterns of behaviour as they seem to settle. Thus, brief joarneys matter because they launch habits of separation, they2are beginnings of an end
love donit be lonely don't let us always be leaving singly on
somne-bleak joirney wait for me. Lonel'iness here is not a fate but a decision you make yourself at
sbme half-unseen, point in your life. a bad choice.
But there . is also the reverse' route out of poetry's badlands: into a language of such wit and grace that it doesn't seem to matter what You say; away from gravity. What is attractive about poets like Tom Pickard and Tom Raworth is that they have taken Verlaine's advice (twist the neck of eloquence) not in the sense of banishing eloquence but in the sense of subduing it. Thus Pickard (Thte Order of Chauce, Fulcrum Press Â£1.40) can write ""Sleep is the sacrifioe of sorrow"" as the ironic titlc of a poem whose movement is of another kind:
my finigers become butterflies
stranige words travel to my balls Raworth (Lion Lion, Trigram Â£1.25, and Movinig. Cape Goliard Â£1.50) can wvrite of thle sparkling games/flickering at the end of my youth, but the lines are themselves a game. a comic mood, an impersonation of an old-style poet. The play and complexity in tbe humour of entered a strange monastery/the order of chzance (Pickard), or life is against the laws of nature (Raworth) seem to me to be worth any amount of stretched solemnities.
In this context, Penguin Modern Poets 19 (Pemguin 30p) appears as a sourcebook, tracing the read back from Raworth and Lee Harwood, a gentler, slowermoving poet in a similar vein, to John Ashbery and the socalled New York school. The road has fine scenery, leads to a world related to that of pop art, where everything, and especially the diet of the popular imagination, becomes matter for metaphor, and for wry, underplayed ver,bal music.
In his Poems of Places and People (Faber Â£1.50) George Barker seems set apart from all this, and in a sense he is, by his great distinction as a poet, his total command of a mature style. Yet in this commanid there is a limitation, a poise which shuts him off from rough subjects, and he seems much more at home on the ""winter track "", as he puts it. in a ""landscape of winter dreams "", brooding on the past, lost friends, emptied places, than in the sultry and ambitious climate of his "" Veusberg"", a sequence of poems, inchuded in the present volume, about the ruining, castrating goddess. So that Barker does belong with most Of the new English poets, trapped by his mastery as they are bound by the ioverty. Whatever his lin ants d occsional failures, George Barker expresses better than anyone now writing a distress whidh never wlhines or clings to false ooniorts, a clear sense of what we have come to call our atlienation.

Lovers of poetry %vho have not travelled much in rcalms beyond the E.xeter by-pass wvill need to knowv that tiggie hobbin is an adaptabic Cornish pudding that can bc eaten first oi last according to the quantities of raisins you put in. Apparentlh it was a favourite of tfhe Old king of Cortitvall who tound it better for sickness of the heart than such foreign delicaoics as passion fruit flummery. Pavlova cake or blueberry grunt.
Although children, we hope, %ill not he given to heart sickness. they may still find contentment in Mr. Causley's Figgic Hobbin IMacmillan, 21s.}--a confection of poems neither so indigestible nor so outright Cornish as the sweetmeat sounds to be. Cornish subjec-ts certainly abound (Stephen Hawker pretending to be a merrymaid ' and singing to the parishioners of Morwensto-e from a rock in the
bay; the children of Launceston tossing pebbles onto the back of a recumbent granite Mary Magdalene to get good luck), but Mr. Causley writes about them in verses that owe much to a purel- English tradition.
Allthrough the book there are echoes.cither of popular rhymes. or of writers who have used the distinctive metric of popular rhynmes. Walter De La Mare in the mysterious Tell me. tell me, Sarah Jane "": or James Reeves in
Colonel Fazackerlev Butterworth-Toast ' (who bought an old castle complete -with a ghost): even A. E. Housman in the sad cadences of "" If )ou should go to Caistor Town"". At the back of it all though is Charles Causlev's own voicc. wr,. faintly elegfiac, sh.unning the easv effects that his simple verse formis could lead him into, and leaving the readers imagination to fill out the unspoken suggestions in many of his poems.
Building upon the traditional manner is a natural technique for a poet designedly writing for children (a questionable enough exercise since. unlike bedtime stories or books. about farm machiner. poetrT. if it is good. is surely just for ""people ""). In the poe;ri of someone like lan Serriallier, though. there is evidence of an attempt to impose upon ballads and nursery rhymes a distinctively
modern'"" tone of voice, to adapt their rhythms to those of twentietb-century conversation. His two most receni books: The Ballad of St. Siimeont (Kaye & Ward, 21s.) and The Tale of Thlree Latdliubbers (Hamilton. 21s.) are t%pical of this process: awkward, occasionallv disjointed struotures, with none of the ease of Charles Causlcv's regular measures. but xwith sudden, offhand thrusts of irony or humour.
In both these books, however. the verse has been used as the hasis for a picture book-colour illustrations to the second bein.
provided bv Ra,rnmond Briggs, and to the first by Simon Stern. The result is that there is a faint discrepancy between Serraillier's slightly sophisticated manner and a format suggesting nursery simplicity. Ir matters less in The Tliree Lanidliubbers. where the narrative is brief and the gaudy, funny pictures a storv in themselves. but St. Simneon, whose complex rhythms are supported by lumpy. rather sardonic illustrations, is verv much a picture book for disenchanted adults.

"Holmes, Richard",Ted Hughes: a brutish metamorphosis,The Times,1970-Dec-17,"London, England","Ted Hughes: a brutish metamornho sis 1
Some 12 years ago Edwin Muir, that most gentle of Scottish poets, wrote of Ted Hughes's early poetry: ""His imnages have an admirable violence."" Since Hawk in tlte Rain (1957) ivas folloewed by Lutpercal (1960) and Wodwvo (1967), the violence in Hughes's' poetry has grown arm in arm with his -popular reputation into a shape of impressive and almost proverbial proportions. Crow (Faber 20s.) his latest piece. is-- even in comparison with the bloodClotted vistas of his Seneca's Oedipus (i969)-the most gory and agonized sequence to date. I do not exaggerate: -
He stands trousered in blood and log-splits
The lolling body. bifurcazes it
Top to bottom, kicks away the entrails-
Steps out of the blood-wallow.. .
Ytet this poetry has received a generally rapturous applause. A work of genius "". writes one d-istinguished critic; "" a newv hero "", writes another reliable one. It may be that this praise is merited. Certainly Hughes is a poet of great linguistic power, and-speaking of post-war English poetry-of the first order of magnitude. Nevertheless, his work fills me vith doubts and unease.
Ted Hughes has always written about the animal world, and the implied animal. analogies with human violence. His -poetry is not unconnected with the wave ot popular animal behaviourism which has washed over us so disturbingly in the past decade (Lorenz. Morris. Ardrey et al.). But in Cro;v. for the first time, Hughes turns the tables and writes consistently from an animal point of view looking back in at the human world
The human world is presented as essentially a place of adult carrion, .rubble and torn sinewzs; ..while CrQW. himself is fundamen-
-taly a childish character, a Mickey Mouse figure. who is minced, crushed, beheaded, made cataleptic in one poem. only to come bouncing back, stropping his beak, in the -next. It is in the impossibility of taking this ghastly equation of existence seriously that my first doubt lies. As a wvorld view, and Hughes. does advance it as a wvorld.view (perhaps there is an odd kind of arrogance here ?)-it is either mildly frivolous or totally despairing. (I was fascinated. to hear a radio critic recently describing these same poems as ""enchanting "".)
Separating out these two elements, the childish and the obsessively vi6lent, it is clear that they have run their course throughout Hughes's published works, though previously restrained by the tightest of poetic leashes. Indeed, many of the poems in Crow have direct forerunners in earlier books
In Crow there is development of a kind: the violence is both more extreme and more carefully located, while the childish vision is used more deliberately.and more grosshl. Violence is nowv overtly centred o01 human- love, sexual relations, and childbirth. In '.A Kill "", ""Crow and Mama "", ""A Childish Prank "". "" Crow's First Lesson"". 'Crow's Account of St. George "", attd ""Song for a Phallus ""-to name only the obvious ones-love and birth are treated in terms of butchery, slaughterhouse xvorlk, and: murderous guilt. The poemn called ""A Kill ""--""As he drowned in his own blood/ Dragged under by the weight of his guts/... And.smashed into the
rubbish of the ground ""-is for example a description of childbirth. Even in the beautiful-penultimate poem, ""HMow Water Began to -P-lay"", the primtordial waterdro. plet conducting its investigations into natural processes ,reaches a typical impasse:
It' went ato tie woinb it met mzaggots and rottenness
It came weepinzg back it wanted to die
This is the third cause -for doubt.
I do not believe that the final test of a sequence of poems lies in its purely aesthetic success. One looks for qualities, difficult: to. describe, of life-enhancement, of responsibility to Riving. How Crow .answers in- this respect may be
inferred. Yet it is.not -here, but in the .brutish metamorphosis coming.
over Hughes's linguistic skill, theapparently deliberate resort to primitive hamfisted adjectives and trudging nonosyllabic phrases, that I rest my final cause for doubt. Though there are many lovely passages. especially in
""Crow and the Birds"" (much quoted. elsewhere) and ""Crow's Undersong "" (which does not, perha'ps significantly.. -feature Crow himself)-
SiC brings petals inl their nectar fruits in their plush
She brings a cloak of feathers an animtal rainbowv
yet these are. unfortunately but unquestionably, the exceptions. T hc linguistic and aesthetic norms in Crowv are passages like those describing Lho two final postnuclear lovers--
Mzztations--at ho;ne in the ,nzclear glare.
Horrors-lhairv anrd slobbery, glossy and raw.
The questioDing of this- kind of writing, and all it implies,- is then the fourtth doubt about Ted Hughes's new work. Unlike my fellow critics, Crow fills me with little rapture :
Turning northwards, there are three new collections of. ScoMttish poetry which- .are to be highly recommended. The. Collecred Poems of Buirns Singer, edited by W. A. S. Keir (Secker & Warburg. 70s.) are the' work of a poet and biologist of. unusual .intellectual penetration . and fine nurrative gifts, exemplified in his long poem "" The Trans~paaent Prisonter '

Acis and Galatea
Queen Elizabeth Hall
Stanley Sadie
Handel is not often counted among music's nature-poets. But A cis and Galaiea must surely represent the topmost peak of pastoral music- - the stylized .ature idyil at its most unclouded in Act 1. then with darker shades of tragedy in Act 11. yet still within the pastoral convention. More than that: there is humour too. "" The monster Polyphemer"" brings about the mortal catastrophe, but he is also very funny: we laugh and cry. both at once, and both in earnest.
If that were not enough. the work ends with Galatea's grief transfigured in one of the most sublimely beautiful songs ever written, "" Heart, thou seat of soft delight"". with the murmurs in sweet thirds of soft recorders and violins standing for the "" crystal flood "" that her beloved Acis has now become.
Ideally. there should have been at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Wednesday a scene representing in a "" Picturesque Manner, a Rural Prospect. with Rocks, Groves Fountains, and Grotto's: amongst which . . . a Chorus of Nymphs and Shepherds. the Habits and every other Decoration suited to the Subject "". But it was a pure concert performance, and the nymplhs and shepherds of the Handel Opera Society Chorus wore black evening dresses and dinner jackets. The music's range of co'our came across, however.
The Bristol Sinfonia. based on 10 violins, incauded a pair of recorders one of which twittered charmingly in spite of Galatea's admonitions in ""Hush, ve pretty warbling choir "". The string playing was finelv alert in the first act (it needed to be in the overture, done at a spanking pace), and textures were beautifully airy. 1Act 11 was rather more tentative, with Charles Farncombe's rhythms seeming less strong-Acis's "" Love sounds th' alarm "", for example could welcomely have been more belligerent. Happy as most of his tempi were, he might profitably have let the work move on faster towards its climax. And why so often were we gratuitously given the dreary thurmp of a pizzicato double-bass ?
For sheer professionalism, in the putting over of- words and music and their meaning, Owen Brannigan as Polypbemus stood
out. And the voice is stiU there too. Ian Partr!dg's Ais was elegantly phrased and warmly expressed, but never seductive in tone, nor ideally resolute in Act. I1. April Cantelo sung surely, as always, but coolly; the sensuousness of Galatea's music was lacking. As Damon Duncan Robertson did little more than sing the notes. there was no sense of Handelian line. The choral music was strongly and energetically sung, mostly in the familiar &A.T.B. version rather than Handel's original but impractical S.T.T.T.B. Here and there the tenors, not surprisingly. sounded strained in exposed music.
In the early evening Festival Hall recital, David Sanger gave the first performance of a new organ work by Peter R.acine Fricker, called Praeludium (because based on seventeenth-century formal and textural methods). It is nine minutes long, but its brevity does not belie the composer's programme-note remark about a large-scale work. It cleverly combines strong musical argument with a highly idiomatic treatment of the instrument.
It starts rhetorically-what instrument can *be rhetorical nowaNtys if not the organ ?-and mbves on to explore other facets of the organ's personality: there are rich. echoing chord patterns with blocks of sound juxtaposed ; there are fleeting, winding lines ranging over the whole keyboard and pedalboard: there are passages of briliant toccata-like figuration. There is a sense of pattern-weaving about the music, of abstract shapes looked at from a variety of angles. It is not as severe as much of Fricker's music; the feeling for the organ's idiom and its colour rules that out. Although breaking little new ground. it is a valuable addition to the organist's modern repertory.
Mr. Sanger aLso Played the obligatory Bach. The D minor concerto after Vivaldi struck me as rather lacking in drive and brilliance, and as somewhat unimaginatively phrased. A group of chorale preludes from the Orgelbaichlein went better. particularly the more direot. forthright ones; registration was sensitively chosen. and articulation was clear, but more feeling for the expressive shape of Bach's lines would have been welcome in. for example, Wenn wir in hochsten Nothen sein",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS218329979/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=f887460e

It comes from Hugh MacDiarmid: Selected Poems (Penguin, Ss.). The weight of this welcome collection lies in NlacDiarmid's poetry of the Thirties, the political exposition of "" the Seamless Garment "" and the "" Hymns to Lenin "". But it is comprehensive enough to illustrate everything from his most exquisite lyrics (like the above) to his broadest didactic claims. ""Our concern is humnan wholeness-the child-like spirit.

How far has he succeeded ? Enough to have written several long poems of first importance. Enough to have passed on these issues, alive, to the next generation of Scots poets.
Penguin Modern Poets 17 (5s.) contains David Gascoyne, W. S. Graham, and Kathleen Raine. In itself, this surprising choize of three poets who until now might have been considered as Forties material, iS a shrewd editorial diagnosis of parallel developments among our youngest writers, The nervous social anger of Surrealism, the glowing, inclusive and very personal communication of Tomantic imagery. are undoubtedly with us
again. The days of dry, clipped wry, ""witty "", neurotic drawingroom poetry are numbered.
Of the three, Kathleen Raine's writinrg has aged least well: dreamy isles, wafts of Sitwell, cloudybright. She nowhere speaks so clearly to the young poet as in her magnificent critical work on Blako (1968). Gascoyne still feels like a period piece; but his "" Christ of Revolution and of Poetry"" is instructive, and at maximan intensity he shows the exemplary "" tuning"" power of Surrealism:

How many frequencies of the contemporary mood he has included here: Eluard, Dali, the desperate domestications of latterdav Prufrock; even. one might hazard, a touch of raffish gothic from the Folies Bergere. But it is W. S. Graham who speaks most directly, his honest regional modulations of voice, his steady assault on the knocking silence across which poetry must come, his vividly dramatic use of modern heroic roles-the explorer, the prisoner, the pilot-out of which to write. He is the most impressive, the most present.
Donald Davie looks back at the work of Pound and Olson in Six Epistles to Eva Hesse (London Magazine Editions. I Os. 6d.).

His own Bedlam and the Oakwood (15s. or 1Os. Caracanet Press.

His most characteristic role is eoet as archaeologistL digging for life among the emba'lmed, with many bizarre and interesting results. At the moment his forms are too restricted, but there is lots of imaginative life struggling out.
Finally. John Moat, who lives in Devon and wrote a sad and beautiful little first novel Hereot (1968) about a writer's attempt to live in a lonely cottage threatened by an imaginary, but powerful, Grendel. His poety in Thunder of Grass (Barrie & Jenkins, 16s.). much of it love poetry, echoes this threatened situation, though the observing eye is less acute and less humorous than in his prose. The countryside plays a graceful and unselfconscious part in traditional lyric and fairytale themes. The best undoubtedly is a poem after John Gower's story of the incestuous child-lovers, Candace and Marshall. Moat produces a magical, simplistic, re-creation.

Bella.n AadWulina is celtbrated for two gifts that one rmight not autorntically associate with lady Russian poets: great personal beauty and intensely lyrical, nervous, responsive verse. It is, regretfully. unnecessarv to amplify on her beauty since this bas been done conclusively by Ycvtushenko. who married her virtually out of school and published a series of ""scarndalous "" love poemsl Whose ter4perature alone must have contributed considerably to the official Soviet "" thaxw "" in which her work has flowered.
What about a "" responsive"" verse? Y&vtmiheiko. writing a Preface to this suoerb little colection of Bella's new poetry Fev-er (translated by Geoffrey Dutton and Igor MezhakoffKoriakin; Peter Owen, 35s.), shows precistly what this means by criticizing her lack of respon^iveness in earlier work: ; It was lackifng in range, far. too many things happening in life and imperiously demanding to be expressed were left outside * .... it seerned criminallv frail and infantile."" This is a crucial statement of principle, expressing with passion our owr. struggle towards the elusive idea of a public poetry "". It should be engraved on the hearts of our poets, and the teeth of our critics. where anatomatically appropriate.
lhether Bella Akhmadulina writes of a pink motor sooter. the nostalgic Georgia of the poet Lermontov, or the world fever which shakes her body to the puzzlement of the doctor and the man next door, waves of response and poetic sympathy are flooding continuously betweln her and the outside world.

Currently there are a number of new Russian translations available in Modern Poetry in Translation 6 (edited by Daniel Weissbort and Ted Hughes from iO Compayne Gardens, N-iW.3, s.). This issue features ,Alexander Blok, Marina Tsvetayeva (lovely versions by Elaint Feinstein). Esenin, Zabolotsky and others. An interesting and
ambitious selection of Blok's work as a whole. translated by Peter France and Jon Stallworthv (himself an accoinplished poet) appears in The Twelve and other Poemns (Eyre and Spottiswoode, 36s.). I
'B0lok (1880-1921). at first a symbolist and at last a revolutionary poet, was wildly unstable and suitably debauched: he alternated between ideal worship of ""The Beautiful Lady"" an<d less Parnassian attachments to a series of ""Snow-maidens' including an actress and, a bad opera singer. Mr. Stallworthv's chronological choice gives a fascinating glimpse into the narra*tjie of these fluctuations, and,in many places catches more than a flicker of the brooding Blokian grace (kept patiently. and correctly in quatrains):
Eaeh eveninz, at the appointi
mornent (oris tis only in a dream ?)
a girl's shape in a silken garment
shows dark against the window's
steam. And slowlv between the drunkards
weaving. as always unescorted. there she sits dosn by the window,
leaving a mist of perfume on the air.
With the revolutionarv poems. knd particularly with ""The Twelve"" itself (1918), he is mucb less successful. There is no sense of shock. But short poems. 'The Factory"" and ""The Vulture"", do bring across Blok's sharp comments of social vision.
Genuine social vision is still exceptional in English poetry. Matthew Mead is 44, but his wvork is just becoming knoNvn. It is engaged, nilful. criticallv aware of inhumane surroundings, but without the remotest hint of pop poetrv and deeply conscious of the literarv effort he has inherited. One poem in The Administration of Things (Anvil. 12s. or 25s.)-and note the implications of the title-- begins characteristically with ""Riot, tumult, anticipated disturbances or ice or war"", but ends with the hovering reflection-
The wind turns and Fe tide waits. Send us something #asy like a run
to Ithaca. Mead is a translator, too. and not unlike W. S. Merwin. his original poetry has gathered resonance and technical clarity from his imnimersion in another culture (German). In one raVishing little song. ""Of the Square Meal "". his unusual combination of traditional and contemporary skills produce s i fine Villon-
esque celebration of the poet's eternal struggle against the murderous, domesticating principle:
Outside Dudins' a poet sang
""The %%orld is endless. cq)d and
dead, The ice a claw, the wind a fang."" A wolf-girl jumrped into his btd.
M1ead is a good poet, knows the problems, deserves to be read.
With Mead's book and The CIttfing Room by Harry Guest (Anvil, 13s.) a second Little Press (the first was Fulcrum) has now confirmed a solid and significant list; cautious, serious, incrcasingly' sure. Guest's work. like Mead's. is literate and quite without flippancy: but unlike Mead. it js highly introspective, with love poems impioding into sclflove. and a frequent intellectual jitter and hyper-consciousness iin the use of words. His narrati\es and mvths are better, with gorgeous, intricate utse made of Japanese settings. Both Mead and Guest are included in Penguin Modern Poets 16, (S.) along with the slightly thinner. but lively and intelligent verse of Jack Beeching. Altogether a strong, unfashionable collection.
The School of Silence. if 1 may say so christen that academne of anguished poetic reticence which trembles on the borders of complete. though often brilliant. speechlessness! continues in the work of Ian Hamilton's rihe Visit (Faber, 1 5s.) and Hugo William's Suigar Daddv (Oxford. 25s.).

Oddly enough, Tippett's first symphony, written all of 25 years ago. received what was apparently its London premierc at last night's R.P.O. concert conducted by ltawrence Foster. Extraordinary that a work so exuberantly enjoyable. so easily assimilated-.provided you are prepared to concentrate-does not figure on the programme of at least one London orchestra in every season.
Tippett was here in the full swing of his early, strongly contrapuntal- period, willing to examine an idea from ever- possible standpoint, allowing his fancy full freedom while at the same time keeping, almost miraculously, a sense of unity not only in a movement but throughout the work as a whole. He also here proved that he has an infallible ear for keeping his textures clear even when on the page the scoring may look heavy.
All this bespeaks the keenness of mind, -the sheer genius of composition, that was soon to lead him on to the delights of Tile Midsummner Marria.Rc, as London audiences will be able to confirm again for themselves when Covent Garden revives the opera next month. Even these days this sympathv must be devilish to play and conduct. Mr. Foster and the orchestra, without modifying speeds or shirking dynamic breadth. overcame practically all the technical hazards and, in the slow movement, added poetry to virtuosity.
These were just the qualities Radu Lupu brought to his playing of Beethoven's second and third concertos. Hc replaced Arrau at short notice and the elder pianist would surely have approved of the younger's combination of finesse and intellectual control. Lupu did not make the mistake of taking the B flat Concerto into the nincteenth century; more positively his playing here, one or two understand-
able smudges apart, was crisp, fresh. spontaneous. The C minor, with which he won the Leeds competition last year. was full of interpretative insight-interpretative liberties too. but they practically all seemed justified on this occasion because they emerged so naturally from Mr. Lupu's romantic heart allied to his superbly sensitive fingers.

THE PENGUIN BOOK OF SCOTTISH VERSE, imroduced and edited by Torn Scott (Penguin. lOs.).. A nationalist anthology of genius, one of the best Penguin has ever managed. The weight of the selection falls quito rightly on the great preReformation poetry, on Robert Henrysoun (the whole of his lovely "" Testament of Cresseid "" is here), William Dunbar ("" the idiocy of caling him a 'Scottish-Chaucerian' ""') Gawin Douglas, and the Balads; though Robert Fergusson (tricked into an Edinburgh Bedlam), Burns and Hugh MoDiarmid get their due. Tom Scott shepherds in the strays (Byron, Stevenson, Lang, Kathleen Raine) like a benevolent but fietcewme watchdog wary of the predatory English and their ""fag-end of modern Poetry"". The solemn scorn he holds for English poetry, the passion with which he looks to the Gaelic and European traditions give this collection a drive and cohesion one rarely sees in a modern anthology.
THE PENGUIN BOOK OF IRISH VERSE, introduced and edited by Brendan Kennelly (Penguin 10s). A helpful and spirited anthology chosen to illustrate the distinctive development of Irish poetry and its mythological resources. It is divided into three parts: * Gaelic translated "", "" AngloIrish "", and "" Yeats and After "". T;he third section, occupying over a hundred pages, gives what is really the first attempt at an overall perspective on post-war Irish work, assembling together James Simmons, Rivers Carew, Desmond O'Grady, Kennelly himself, Seamus Heaney, Michael Longley, Derek Mahon, and 23-year-old Tom McGurk. Very welcome.

COLLECTED POEMS: BASIL BUNTING (Fulcrum 21s.). The Northumbrian poet, now 70, the courage and, tenacity of whose life, the compactness of whose work, have'been of such direct and intimate assistance in the revival of English poetry in the 1960s. Note particularly his creative use of translation, and the austere application of his famous blue pencil.

"Brett, Guy",Hockney's poetry and wit,The Times,1970-Apr-02,"London, England","Hockney's poetry and wit
by Guy Brett,.
Whitechapel Gallery Hockney
Despite his fame and his popularity David Hockney is ar. elusive sort of artist. Blut the Whitechapel Gallery bas made every -effort to bring bim home to roost. Mark Glazebrook's catalogue lists and illustrates virtually al Hockney's Paintings since 1960 and the exhibition which opens today puts on show a large number of them, as well as all Hockncy's prints anid etchings.
Many of Hockney's recent paintings have been about California. So. much so, that one easily identifies his qualities, his whole painting style, with the vision he has given us of that place. Describing ' California "" one describes a Hockney: the expensive but biscuit-thin buildings set off tastefully with shrubs, the oval or rectainle of tame swimming-pool water, the carpet-like lawn which' a sprinkler, half fountain and half maintenance.device, keeps always green. People generally make languid appearances. In ""Portraii of Nick Wilder"". for instance, the Los Angeles gal!eryowner soaking in his pool, appears
like a living bust surrounded by the depersonalized components of his home and comfort, which also form a collection of amusing and elegant passages of painting.
Hockney has caught the antisoptic. v~pid atmosphere of-California so well th~at people feel he must disapprovc of it. But he says he enjoys it. And this seems to me to describe exactly the sort of freedom, the kind of vassive detachment, that goes with a witty temperament. He enioys it. but he sees it clearly. Hockney is painting about artificialities, and has always enjoyed the myriad, artificialities of the technique of painting. One thing that, in an exhibition of internationai mainstream art, makes his work stand out as an oddity is his readiness to play about with art devices -nd styles whicth other artists may take very seriously. He is so detached from these devices that he can treat them as things, in some cases like pieces of furniture surrounding a figure in a painting.
But this makes one wonder all the more where Hockney's heart lies. A device he has often used is a curtain, painted as if it was hanging very near the pictureplane, often with runners painted in near the top of the canvas. He likes it partly because it is a similar
tning in substance to the canvas itseif. He manipulates the curtain cleverly enough in' many paintings as a technical d&vice for reveUling a ""scene within a scene"", but it is only in some human, sensual situation, for example in ""Two men in a shower "", that the curtain beones a poignant influence in the vainting.
Hockney's work has no trace of rhetoric. Part, of -his poetry and Wit is to let effects emerge rather than force them, whioh often makes his work look deceptively casual. It appears in his earliest paintings based on graffiti. Where another might play up the drama of these anonymous messages, Hockney is shy and oblique: ""I want to meet somebody -who is like myself"" is written faintly on one. His early work, referring to his agitated student life in London- is full of clinging and dancing figures. even if the titles always keep a cool hold on events. But the toothy faces are gradually replaced by imipassive heads, sometimes based on Egyptian sculptures, appearinug among domestic things, and Hockney comes to the neat and relaxed realist paintings he is making today.
Again, their success seems to *depend on letting things emerge
and letting an emotion take bold of the artificialities. In "" The -room. Tarzana "", the setting is flawlessly neat and artificial and the boy of flesh and blood lying on 'the bed becomes a focus of sensuality in a- rather similar way to the adolescent girls in Balthus's paintings. I don't think this emotion depends on a human presence.
Yet in many of his recent paintings he seems to become caught in the. blandness he enjoys. The double portrait of Christopher Isherwood and Don Bachardy has acres of mere sweetly coloured formality. Going over to the etchings and drawings you find there is a quality of continuous delight missing in many of the paintings. 1. say- ""delight"" because it is in Hockney's use of the medium itself, and appears in the most straightforward portrait, an extraordinary skill and knowledge. Here also you can see how important the them- is to Hockney. Setting up paintings sometimes leads him into a kind of visual perversity, but his detachment. his lack of formal commitment, Tesponds marvellously well to being whisked off to illustrate the world of Cavafy or the Grimm Brothess, where the atrnosphere or magical story can support his imaginative and furiny references.

Richard Holmes
It fs probably treacherous. perhaps even in bad taste, to admit it. But at the present time there is an extraordinary:.uncertainty about who exactly modern poets are. and what exactly they are meant to be doing. It ist a. moment of peculiarly English diffidence and indecision; and certain things simply canMot be said,
For example. ""The Review
which may be described as the haunted medieval castle of modera English poetry, has issued forth from its grim critical portcullis three pale' and desperately thin poetry pamphlets (No. 21, parts 1, 2, and 3: 2s. each) by Colin Falck, Hugo Williams. and Alan Page. The first two display an alarmingly. identical kind of acute depression and emotional dryness. which breathes out a few low murmurs of verse. whimsical, hesitant, lipbiting to the point of comic self-pity. Mr. Falck in the night-
Alone with the night wind
I man this damp house and lie awake
Remembering your voice last summer.
Mr. Williams, the next morning-
In the'morriing the birds break up our lovemaking.
They treat us, like very young children.
They know it will end in tears.
These poets move one with a wholly altruistic passion to pat them on the shoulder and render tea and sympathy. It is not the lack of skill (the skill is there, sometime exquisitely), but the lack of heart. Such a criticis. it is only fair to point out, is an acknowledged academic heresy. with a technical namre to define it. What is inescapable nevertheless, is that Alan Page in the third pamphlet, versions k-onm the Greek, "" Poems of Yannis Ritsos"", simply by drawing on completely un-Eng-
lish sources of energy and feeling, corncs up with some really accomplished and beautiful poems: see particularly "" First Voluptuousness "".
It is symptomatic that the New State'sman poetry critic should recently (March 6) spend several hundred words describing an ""' identikit ' average English poet "". He did this presumably on the off-chance that someone answering to the description might be discovered, apprehended, and brought in for urgent questioning. In his fourth collection. A Cold Day at the Zoo (Rapp & Whiting, ZSs. and 16s.), Edwin Brock the policeman turned adman. is also assailed by waves of uncertainty witb his occupation amounting sometimes to self disgust.
But he has become expert at pulling valuables from the continuing wreckage-as he dramatizes it-of his private life. He has anger. ebullience, and-saving grace-.bursts of caustic humour. He has, on occasions, the true poet's blindingbhonesty. These qualities are summed up in a rmemorable passage:- You buy me
in a small transparent ball
almost entircly filled with water. You shake me
and a Plastic snowstorm will ensue.
The title of that poem is. justly, ""A Man of the World"".
The love poem is perhaps the classic and riskiest form of the search for identity and certainty. When it is pursued with such deftness and originality and laughter in a first collection like Michael Mackmin's The Play of Rainbow (Cape Goliard. 30s. and ]5s.). there is cause for real excitement and congratulation. "" When all the seas gang dry, my dear"" is one of the timehonoured formula; with typical gaiety and a shot of science-
fiction, Mackmin transforms it into-

Mackmin, born in London 1941, fiils his poems with an unusual lushness of textures, tastes. and smolls - skin, strawberries. denim, petals, butterflies. field scents. Though the verse movement can become va.porous and slight, he is deft with new phrases. ""the flut and flack of blaok wings""; and has delightfully oblique or. even surreal ways with erotic sensation

The difference is, you might say, that our door handles do not turn in the night. Or if they do, it is stifl a movement of innocence, the household hound pawing to be let in, the baronia-
ghost making his Dickensian round. At the very worst, the intention is amorous. But for the Polish poet Tymoteusz Karpowicz, there is a totally different significance in that chill rattle, one that is felt by most Europeans and one that is central to Michael Hamburger's The Truth of Poetry: What horrible dream made the poet

Here the intention is murderous. Behind, the door in the night in 20th century Europe has been the hand of military and'political terror, the threat of repression, persecution, even genocide. It is a simple fact. Your fear is metaphysical. says another' Polish poet, "".mine is small-a clerk with a briefcase "". Beside the simple fact, as in Karpowicz's poem, the European poet's traditional language shakes to pieces. The Symbolist butterfly dissolves in literary dust the Surrealist forest folds. up like a pantomime stage-prop. There remains the prosaic. anonymous fact ; there remains what Mr. Hamburger calls ""the international anti-poetry"" the door knob has moved.
This pressure, which 'is both social and linguistic. does not really jnake much senge in England. We know about it, but we
have not known it. In our poetry it is only reflected obliquely. In the dark violence that broods in the ditches and-ponds of Ted Hughes's early nature poems; or earlier still in the deliberately childlike horror of Auden's ballads before the War
O ifs broken the lock and splintered the door
O it's the gate where they're turning, tumning
Their boots are heavy on the floor And their eyes are burning.
But abroad it does make sense, and "".anti-poetry"" is a term Mr. Hamburger can apply in different and illuminating ways to poets as distinctive as Brecht, Tadeusz Rosewicz, Andrei Vosnesenski, Hans Magnus Enzensberger, Zbigniew Herbert, or even William Carlos Williams.
Karpowi z'zs is only one poem, and of course anti-poetry is only one point at issue. But it is exemplary. The critical and imaginative, gap which Mr. Hamburger has -had to leap in this brilliant and sweeping-study of "" modern poetry from Baudelaire to the 1960s "" is immense. Though his book is primarily an examination of German, French and American poetry, he ranges over more than 50 important poets, among them Russian, Portuguese, Polish, Italian, Greek, and Spanish. There are very few foretunners on this scale: C. M. Bowra's Poetrv and Politics (1966) perhaps.
Hamburger has already been called ""encyclopaedikc ; one would also add patient, gentle and clearheaded in exposition, lavish with translated material, amazingly free from the rural sourness deep in most English critics' bones, and quietly but subversively armed with confidence in the power of poetry to
hold a psition in modern society. He writes that ""to remember the 'great rubbish dump', junk yard and cemetery bf the recent past, while doing all they can to prevent the creation of more, is one of the functions that has come to unite poets in almost every part of the world "". You see the mad glint in his eye. And are very grateful for it.
In his delicate working of the theme of "" tensions "" between public and private poetry, literal and absolute imagination (tensions which he finds within rather than between good poets), two crucial things emerge about his argument. First, it could not have becen made except by a critic who is also and simultaneously a fine translator and an interesting poet. The three work together and it is a good omen.
His latest collection of poems Travelling (Fulcrum, 30s.) shows how directly, though darkly, he confronts society at the same time as saying ""the poem knows better than I do what it's about. what form it must take, what material it needs "". This intimate sense of masks and personae comes out excellently in the early chapters, and he
greets. the Portuguese poet l Pessoa, who wrote and indeed lived under four entirelv different names, like an old fiend.
Secondly. he is at last a man writing with a continuous sense of the political status of poetry. Not political in a crude ideological way, but in the way that makes Enzensberger's superb poem ""the end of the owls "" political, in the way that acknowledges the complete hum4n responsibility that the poet has in wbatever society he writes. As much as any family man, to guard the door.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS403141176/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=391fccb2

By Max Harrison
On his gramnophone recordings of popular concertos Nelson Freire tends to make an unpromnising start but to improve sharply later. Perhaps the shortness of the four movements of Liszt's Piano Concerto No. I partly explains the unflattering account he gave of himself at the Festival Hall last night on that they afforded him little time to settle down.
There were several quite good Passages, such as the opnBg keyboard solo of the Quasi adagio, wAhich had some lyrical feeling, and much of the scherzo, where speed. accuracy and lightness are the most obvious requirements.
Buit in the main the concerto was dispatched purely as a display vehicle-this being underlined by a brash yet perfunctory accompaniment from the Royal Philharmonic under Rudolf Kempe.
No one could doubt Mr. Freire's ability to move about his instrument with astonishing speeoindeed. there were parts of the concerto that one had never heard played anything like so fast.

CHILDREN OF ALBIOiN
Poetry of the "" Underground"" inl Britain
EDITED BY MICHAEL HOROVI7Z (Pelngin 0Os)
On the cover of this anthology, Blake's Albion bursts out of nether darkness in fleshly apricot glories. On the dedication page, Allen Ginsberg salutes the "" new-nippled generation "". In a vatic editorial Afterword (60 pages), Michael Horovitz heralds the coming of the PoetPriests and the ""remaking of languages round which the new 'global tribes can settle"". But among the poets--3 contemporary and not so con temporary Children of Albion-an altogether more restrained, more various, more inquiring mood proves to be emanating from the mianholes of Charing Cross Road.
Horovitz, though cloaked with bad puns and daggered with self-advertisement, makes good points. Underground poets, he says, stand for public poetry in performance, for radical political commitment, for the prophetic social visions inspired bv Blake and Ginsberg. He is borne out in part by one of the best poets here, Adrian Mitchell: and would also be borne out by Christopher Logue, Alan Bold and Alan Jackson if they werc
not inexplicably excluded from the body of the text. Bu; remembering Orpheus (or Lot's wife), Hlorovitz does not look over his shoulder.
For the most striking common factor among these "" Underground"" poets-who are on the wbole the kings of what one may call the Big Little Presses (Fulcrum, Trigram, Ferry, Anvil)-is a brilliantly recovered use of the tight, hardrhymed lyric stanza or Song form. It appears in Tom Pickard. Gael Turnbull, Adrian
l itchell, Herbert Lonias, John Arden and Neil Oram. In John ,McGrath it produces a simple and faultless verse like-
When up the Strand the foxes glide
And hedgehogs sniff and wildeats Yell
And golden orioles come back
To flash tbrough Barnes and Clerkenwell
When govenments and industries Lie choked by weeds in fertile rain For sure the few who stay alive
Will laugh and grow to love again.
This is certainlv Blakean. but it's the earlv Blake of ' Cbimney Sweeper"" and ""London"". The other connion note is intinmate rather than vatic: a new intimacy of an unembarrassed, open-handed kind, often concerned with children or growing up (into the childhood of poetry) as in Patrick Waites's pungent "" Blue Dog "" or Ansehm Hollo's nemorable Zoo visit.

He keeps his familv (two little girls) on the procceds of public readings. Fortnightly he is somewhere uttering from Circe, which took seven years to write and which he will publish this autumn for himself. He drives off with his car full of books and persuades them into t'le shops where the readings are. "" I cover every major town three times a year, which is about enough.""
As a poet be stays on the network. He trawls in Flame, Fort. Fux, Fire. Sphinx, Underdog, Underground, Ambit, Gambit and Matter. As a publisher he has a tolerance for the drop-ins of the permitted society. He has to have-they ring him from San Francisco to pass the time of day. Only it's night time here.
He began with Basil Bunting, in 1965. Bunting's Loquitnr was a throwaway gesture, he says. He was guilty about the size of his grant from the Medical Research Council. Richard Hamilton designed the cover and they put everything into it. Bunting's Briggflatts is his best seller, nearing 7,000. Now 3,000 is his routine first print for every book. Penguin, Montgomery says, offered Bunting Â£50 for paperback rights. "" It turned out to be a bad joke."" But in any case he'll do his own paperbacks, as Faber do. ""The author as well as the publisher makes more out of it.""
Montgomery is the cynosure of the poets who think in terms of involvement-xvith media, with audiences, with one another, with paint, with print. He mistrusts the poets who send off a bundle of manuscripts without knowing what goes on at the press. "" Every poet has at some time to become his own publisher, arrange his own readings, be involved in production. Bunting brought out his own first book, Pound his first two. Creeley ran the Divers Press, William Carlos Williams paid a little printer round the comer to bring out twvo booklets, Yeats's books were done by his sister, e.e.cummings had a tame printer.

ANTHOLOGY OF CONTEMPORARY ROMANIAN POETRY
EDITED AND TRANSLATED BY ROY MACGREGORHIASTIE
(Peter Owen 40s)
The poetry of Romania has been received in England with the kind of scepticism usually reserved for such central European phenomenon as the sea coast of Bohemia. A single edition of Romanian folk ballads infiltrated late Victorian England under the editorship of the comic dramatist Vasile Alecsandri, and I have managed to turn up a somewhat chintzy anthology ""The Bard of Dimbovitza "" collected "" from the lips of peasants"" in 1902. There is only one Romanian library in the British Isles-at Hull, where Mr. MacGregor-Hastie lectures. Even the exemplary new Penguin Companion to European Literature (1969j observes no more than one Romanian author born in this century. Finally
there is a story about the Bntish Council taking a high-powered delegation of Romanian writers on a cultural visit to the Black and White Minstrel Show. Enough.
Romiania does have both poetry and a sea coast (Ovid was exiled there on the Black Sea, and wrote,"" a man dies happy here even against his will ""). Since Trajan conquered Dacia in 105, arnies have stumped continuously cast and west across the plains of Wallacia and Moldavia, and the Latin base of the Romanian language has been rich-ly layered with Slavonic, Turkish, Greek, German and Magyar elements making it s.uperbly thick in metaphors and associations. The Napoleonic Wars 'brought a dominantly French and western consciousness to the metropolis, and to this day Bucharest with her boulevards and cafes, her flourishing theatres and literary
magazines, looks wistfully towards Paris. Branciusi and lonesco are of course Romanian, and so too Tristan Tzara, the originator of Dadaism in Zurich. In 1965 the new regime of Nicolae Ceausescu took over from the Stalinists, and symbolically changed the vaguely Slavic "" Rumania "" to the sharply Latinate "" Romania "". It was also a good year for poetry, and many poets who had not published since the thirties brought out new volumes.
Closely supported by the Rumanian Writers Union, but single-handed and obviously unencouraged in England, Mr. MacGregor-Hastie has collected, translated, edited and introduced this first modern anthology in English. It covers poets born between 1880 and 1944, a sweep equivalent to the Faber Book of M lodern Verse combined with Alvarez's T he New Poetry. Although the selection is kept down to two or three poems each, and translations are never more than workmanlike, a unique and attractive quality emerges from the 57 poets included: indigenous and sparkling folklore mixed with French and German surrealism; a strong lyric impulse tempered by the terrible irony of their political experiences (the like of which, it can never be over-emphasized, are completely unknown to us on this island). Furthermore, the Romanians are certainly the most energetic
poetic translators in Europe. As their master figure Tudor Arghezi urged, all the poets have their "" personal translation programmes"" which reach out to France, Germany, Italy, Spain, America, Russia, and (reproachfully) England.
The most striking pieces in the whole book are from a group of five poets-Eugen Jebeleanu, Gellu Naum, Maria Banus, Magda Isanos and Nina Cassian (note the last three are women) who faced the Second World War in their twenties when the older literary figures had nearly all been herded into Tirgu Jiu, known as the poets concentration camp. One by Magda Isanos opens-
I would like to hiss this poem like
a wave breaking, to cover the black part of the
world so that everything would be white like an enormous hospital
without any dead, without any
names.... She fought and died in 1944.
I suspect that the note of desperation is not entirely irrelevant to Romania s present situation from which this anthology has gallantly struggled into the open: and our ignorance of what is excellent there does not help. Or should we go on believing with the learned Benedictine Dom Augustin Calmet that Transylvania is merely the home of the encastellated vampire (see Dissertation sutr Les Vampires el Revenants, Paris 1749) ?",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS335769850/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=a58bb636

The whole point of poetry
Richard Holmes
""Poetry was always meant to be spoken aloud "", stated W. H. Auden as he surveyed the clamorous foliage of Green Park from the vantage point of the Arts Councirs rooftop, "" but Homer could rely on his audience knowing the Proper Names: I can't."" "" The whole point of poetry "", gasped Robert Bly, swaying hypnotically in the limelights of the Queen Elizabeth Hall, "" is in the end, as the Orientals knew, to wake up."" ""You see, I am both a scientist and a poet"", said Dr. Miroslav Holub confidentially in a corner, ""my poet friends like that; but my scientist friends do not. For them it is creating falsehoods, speaking inaccuracies. Poetry Readings in Prague ?-ah, no."" ""I listen to these young men"", said 73-year-old Austin Clarke, majestically ablaze with white hair, emerald-green knitted waistcoat, and small black Guinness bottle, "" and I think they complain a bit too much. We know
of these troubles in Ireland. Our poets have seen it all before. Still, they're learning.""
We are all learning. The four evenings of the Second Poetry International almost exactly fulfilled Philip Sidney's downright definition of 1580: ""to delight and teach "". A Third International is now planned for 1971. but after the multiple triumphs of last week's Festival-with poetry (and varied attitudes to poetry) trom Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Greece, Ireland, the West Indies, and America-one can only hope that it will take place next summer, and annually thereafter. The London International could become a fixture to rival Spoleto. Then perhaps even the politicians might include it in their calendars, and Ritsos and Voznesensky and Wole Soyinka could be with us again.
The first two pioneering Internationals (1967, 1969) have been co-directed by Ted Hughes and
Patrick Garland. Mr. Hughes himself made many of the contacts abroad, and the translations we heard on stage are closely linked to the fine Penguin Modern Poets series which now includes Enzensberger (Germany), Herbert (Poland), Holub (Czechoslovakia), Grass (Germany) and Popa (Yugoslavia). The Hungarian Janos Pilinszky, whose harrowing war poetry had such an impact this year (his voice deceptively gentle, his face fine-boned, fastidious), will appear in a translation by Hughes this autumn.
Patrick Garland has established an excellent style of direction. Tight reading schedules and minimal introductory fuss are combined with what looks like a deliberate and somewhat impish policy of contrasts (and even clashes) of poetry and personality on stage. Pilinszky delicately easing his collar while Robert Creeley and Robert Bly embraced in mutual Calliopian enthusiasm. W. H. Auden for ever tapping his chronometer, jangling his change,
trying to hustle off stage while Austin Clarke embarked on yet another eighteenth-century Harp Song. Indeed, each night had its quite individual piquancy and success.
Poetry emerges, in a way we easily forget in England, as a magnificently public expression of communal emotions. My fellow critics (some of whose pens I cannot forbear to note were locked so professionally in their hands as to impede the physical action of applause) tended to admire the more homely species of feeling: the urbane reactionary scorn of Auden; the sharp cocktail satisfaction of Ogden Nash rhyming the backend off the American matriarchy; the dignified metaphysicality of Derek Walcott's approach to West Indian problems. But it was in those alien moments of embarrassment. or puzzlement or even affront that the genuinely international element broke through. Bly outrageously mixing homestead haiku with Vietnam horrors; Clarke patiently relating his Gaelic inberitance to James Larkin and Liberty
Hall; Brathwaite (the other West Indian) abandoning the iambic for the calypso rhythm and actualUy singing his lyrics
Holuh fiercely celebrating Jan Palach-"" where man ends/ flame begins "". The shock, the confrontation with a flavour of thought or feeling not quite to oiur exquisite English palates, was the great thing, the poetic thing, the international thing.
So, hopefully, we await next year. Mean-while there is a considerable amount of spooken poetry to be heard. I pick out especially the monthly progranmnes on. B.B.C. Third Radio "" Poetry Now "" and "" The Living Poet""; current poetry recordings from Argo, and Stream Records; *and Jeremy Robson's Poetry and Jazz circus which tours constantly acnd has just released in its wake Poems from Poetry and Jazz in Concert (Souvenir Press, 30s.), a cheerful orange anthology of prize pieces by 24 poets with miany photographs to prove it is really happening here at lost.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS352547059/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=7920b550

AN ORKNEY TAPESTRY
BY GEORGE MACKAY BROWN
Janet Adam Smith
(Gollancz 42s)
George Mackay Brown is an Orkney man and a poet. He was encouraged to write poetry by another Orkney man, Edwin Muir. under whom he studied at Newbattle Abbey. He has much of his elder's visionary powers, of the older poet's feeling-natural in islands strewn with the stones and dwellings of prehistoric man-for the movement of time, so that every present life seems to contain within it something of lives long past.
Edwin Muir, exiled at 14 to Glasgow and then a wanderer in Europe, looked back to his Orkney childhood as to a lost Eden-"" The sky fitted the earth then"". George Mackay Brown still lives in Orkney, and in his prose stories (collected in A Calenidar of Love and A Timne to Keep) he can turn a sharp eye on the harshness and the follies of island life: the girl who has to sell herself for drink, the progressive
minister who thinks of Christ as the good organization man, the drunken fisherman who can't see that his neglected wife is dying. But behind his unillusioned view of the present is the sense, not of a lost Eden (though if there was a Fall he would put it at the Reformation) but of what the community could be and perhaps, at moments in the past, has been. In the finest of his poems, like "" The Funeral of Ally Flett "", he has celebrated such a community, bound not by sentiment but by mutual needs, concerns and pleasures in fishing-boat, harvest-field and pub. Now in Anz Orkney Tapestry he is trying to:
get back to the roots and sources of the communitv, from which it draws its continuing life, from wlich it cuts itself off at its peril.
It is a rich, uneven mixture of poetry, drama, history and jeremiad. First there is the record of one valley, Rackwick, on the island of Hoy. from the coming of the longships and the first settlers to the coming of "" progress "" and only one farm left. Then come portraits of three
Vikings: the warrior Sigurd killed at Clontarf, the martyr Magnus whose death brought peace to the islands, Rognvald the Crusader. He built the Cathedral of Magnus in Kirkwall, and went to Jerusalem to atone for all the "" murder, piracy, rape, war, sacrilege"" done by Norsemen from Greenland to the Volga; when the fleet made landfall at Nar'bonne he passed the summer making courtly love to the Countcss Ermengarde among the roses and troubadours.
Two chapters follow on Lore, which does not mean the usual guidebook snippets of quaint customs but an account of the midsummer and midwinter rituals-pagan in origin but still living in the midsummer fires and harvest reels, the singers at the door on New Year's Eve. Lastly there are pictures of two poets: an anonymous ballad singer in the hall of Earl Patrick about the time of the Reformation, and a poet not long dead, Robert Rendall. Rendall was a draper in Kirkwall who wrote dim Georgian verse-but when he
turned to the Orkney dialect produced poems direct and unsentimental as the sagas, ""the most beautiful poems written by an Orkney man since the Reformation killed the songs and ballads of the people "". The book ends with a play about drunken fishermen and a heavenly visitant.
It is an odd mixture but I think it is Mr. Mackay Brown's way of making certain statements. Even in the bloodiest days, he seems to say, there was a sense of belonging together, of sharing each other's lives. Even in the most brutal days there were some, like Magnus, to give their lives for peace and some, like Rognvald, to find that love could mean courtesy and gentleness. Even in the most ignorant days the words of ballad-singer or common crofter could have a bite and edge. Even in the poorest days there could be dignity, and a sense of the mystery and richness of life, expressed in the rituals of church or harvest. Such are the forces that shaped the community. Now, looking round at people who parrot yesterday's television
opinions, call their homes Sunnybrae or Roseville instead of the stark Norse names, he begs them to remember what kind of men they truly are.
Mr. Brown is a far better poet than preacher and some of his diatribes on the present run too glibly. It would be easy to accuse him of selectivity, in his history and social observation. For instance, the eight men who manned the Hoy lifeboat last March and were drowned in the Pentland Firth must have been subjected to Mr. Brown's corrupting influences-ideas of progress, mass communications and so on-but they acted with the unsentimental courage and compassion of a Magnus. But I am sure that what matters in Mr. Brown's book is-the concern he shows for the quality of life, for the possibility of men living together in true cooperation with each other and their environment. He writes of the place he knows, a handful of northern islands with 20,000 people. But the questions he raises concern us all.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS335769836/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=177f84bc

An Anthology of A nglto-Welsh Poetry
EDI7ED BY JOHN STUART WlILLIAMS AND .M4EIC STEPHENS (Dent 36s)
The Wclsh Dragon, it is said, has a forked tongue. One tip speaks English and the other Welsh. Writing in English, but often inspired by or translating from the Welsh, the Anglo-Welsh poets stand self-consciously at the hot and delicate joint. As one poet, Anthony Conran. puts it. the actual word "" Welsh "" means strangers; but "" Cymry "" means friends, compatriots.
In this "" authoritative and comprehensive "" twentieth-centurv anthology, the poets emerge as passionate mediators: between vhat is seen as the corrupt imperialism of London and the slaty isolationism of Cardiff: between damp provinciality and crackling nationalism; between old chapels and new supermarkets.
The very fact that such a collection has appeared is intimately related to current political and cultural upheavals, and has literary parallels in Ireland and Scotland. Behind this book lies the Penzguin Book of Welsht Verse (all in English, 1967); and behind that, the Oxford Book of Welsh Verse (all in Welsh, 1962). And skirmishing alongside now are the lively quarterly issues of Poetry Wales-bilingual, of course.
At first you may have doubts: to call W. H. Davies or Edward Thomas (St. Paul's and Oxford) or even Dannie Abse "" Anglo-
Welsh"" smacks of ingenuity. But then in Idris Jones. Dylan Thomas, R. S. T homas, Ravmond Garlick. a strong Welshzness does genuinely emerge: a Welshness in attitudes to tradition and survival ("" Warming our hands at the red past"") : in the dignified, musical use of language: and above all in the consciousness of a Welsh Problem as their inescapable inheritance. R. S. Thomas fixes it superbly:-
Yet men sought us despite this.
Mv high chek-bones, my length
of skull
Drew them as to a rare portrait
By a dead master. I saw them
stare
From their long cars, as I passed
knee-deep
In ewes and wethers, I saw them
stand
Bv the thorn hedges, watching me
string
The far flocks on a shrill whistle.
Even the old Welsh cvngha. nedd - word-tuning - modulates the last line.
In the younger poets (thougb all here have passed their thirtieth vear to heaven) the future holds rich and un-English possibilities. In Anthony Conran, wonderfully swelling translations from the old Welsh. In John Tripp and Meic Stephens, a raw satiric use of the old bardic status in the community, as representative spokesman not teacup dilettante. In Raymond Garlick an appeal to Europe
source to which our ballads grope
context, compass-card
and hope
over the heads of London and Gomorrah. Europe, after all. was where the great Dafydd ap Gwilym turned in the 1360s, and redeemed the green invaded valleys with his lyrics.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS336425196/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=38c3f57a

NEW NUMBERS
BY CHRISTOPHER LOGUE
Dennis Potter
(Cape 25s, paperback 12s)
Although Christopher Logue rnodestly describes himself as a ' sexy young girl living among corrupted villagers"" he could scarcely by any other exercise of reason be called a purely decorative poet. Except that some of his nore aggressive poems are printed on posters which are occasionaUy used by odd householders to add trendy typographical variants to their living room cisulsion. Nfy literary agent, for example, displays one of Logue's large poster-verses (all 100 per cent of it) on his otherwise quite ordinary kitchen wall. It is stuck tp above the refrigerator, which duly shudders from time to tirne-but I feel that the piece belongs better over the gas cooker, a literary appendage to thle blue flame and fumes and slowly cooking bits of innocent animal:
High in the freezing summer air
Sixteen smiling censtables will
Spray
hlallucinating vapours on the crowd from U.S. army helicopters;
and when these dreamy moistures
bead their flesh
troubled enthusiasts will cat each other raw....
It is difficult to be entirely comfortable in such a kitchen. even if you were assured that the poster was impregnated with a chemical which kills flies. The eye struggles down the lines to take in the blind war hero, nine naked girls, the Foden Motor Works band, and a spastic who faints outside the National Gallery. Always, in Logue's scenarios, the sky is full of weeping reds and moulting birds chirrup weary obscenities at each other through the thickening carbon monoxide. An all too familiar landscape. easily assembled out of masticated newspaper cuttings.
The best of Christopher Logue's most recent poems have come down off the wall and coagulated together between the shiny, salmon pink covers of a respectable publisher: shouts and sniggers divided up by firm black lines which sprawl across the page like uprooted railings from some blighted private gardens. It is good to have some of these poems on the page; that one on the kitchen wall, too, for here it can be shut away or turned off like any other appliance.
Yet this is still overwhelmingly a public sort of poetry, owing more to megaphones than meiosis. Polemical, lavatorial, de-
liberately or even wantonly philistine and occasionally sad in a theatrical manner, these pieces need to be read aloud in a crowded room Nvhere each individual spasm of distaste or embarrassment can be subsumed by the inevitable collective guffaw, which would space out the delivery. Logue is, at the very least, often extremely funny, though bitterly and grotesquely so. He might almost be categorized as the cruelly mutated Donald McGill of poetry, full of pillarbox rhythms, lewd couplets and improbable mamillary fantasies. But each laugh is framed by a w-ince, the way we smile nowadays, frightened to let too much get through.
And New Nrumbers does not let enough through either. Instead of the sexy young girl living among corrupted villagers one senses instead a lonely, middle-aged beachcomber dwvelling in a festering metropolis, picking over newspaper headlines, advertising hoardings, restaurant asides, or vaiting for the television picture to collapse into creamy blankness. Logue has perhaps deliberately turned himself into a chronicler of the second-hand experience, the weary joke, the motorway fastness. He does not even seem to
hear the tunes vhich remind us. of other people's desires. It is a heavy price to pay, this battlescarred "" commitment "" which blurs all the faces and forgets the individual features. Thus, he writes more of what might be called the mere callisthenics of sex rather than the quick-ening emotions of love, which can (believe it or not) be caught in a gesture which plucks whole sentences out of the air.
But to leave it at that would be too harsh. Christopher Logue seems to be refusing to use his considerable gifts on the far side of the disgust and disintegration and psychosis which now set the parameters of almost all creativity. There is a dogged honesty about his lewdness, a desperate integrity about the jokey alienation. He will pivot upon a wellknown advertising slogan, turning it every wvhichway, lacerating each commercial syllable until you feel that only rotting offal is left on the supernarket shelves.
Go to work on an egg
bounce a cheque on an egg fail your test on an cgg
wipe your arse on an egg despair on an egg
touch yourn an n cgg
and so on, and so on, ever more ludicrous until the shell splinters in a helpless little joke.
He is fond, too, of making endless lists of things, hoarding bits and pieces, a kleptomaniac carefully hiding the deeper unease he refuses to explore. New Nuimbers must surely be the hesitant prelude to genuine development-no matter how much more horrible -or a confession of exhaustion. I prefer to think, and very inuch hope, that it is the former. Now-he has to open the egg.
Certainly, the arrogance is there to go beyond the chewved up slogans. He admits in his first line that he writes ""in order to change the world "". Well, of course. But do not wait to read the evening papers, Mr. Logue.
If this book doesn't change you give it no house space; if having read it you
arc the same person you
were before picking it up, then throw it away.
The publishers would have been in tune with the irony so often expressed in these funny, troubled and lively pages if they had folded in a KEEP BRITAIN TIDY sticker. Personally, I am keeping my copy, and admitting nothing.

"" To love all without loss of edge ""
Richard Holmes
Ile Oxford Poetry Lectures, like the Papal Encyclicals. are well-known dividers of men of good will. As Roy FuUer surveys the English field from the rampart of the spiry city, arguing for the traditional values of high tone and high skill enshrined in Richards' Practical Criticism (see 1LS 22 May), and excommunicating the insurgent experimentalists for Sentimentality-one wonders if the lines of faith are not being drawn, by both sides, too eagerly, too dogmatically. The opposition of traditional with experimental verse is a lax alternative. Surely the real question is, what can a poet be doing, as Eliot would say, now and in England.
Nathaniel Tarnms new book is called The Beautifutl Contradictions (Cape Goliard, I 5s, hardback 28s). This is how he sees the poet at work:
rhyming the fields and cities
scanning the roads apportionig the harvests
liberating the days
motor of energies guide of hands
bed of rest setting his songs to music
his music to the spheres he has time in the carth his body
he has time to spare
for the most beautiful revolution
of all. At once the largeness, the confidence is striking. Something has to be found: an alternative poetry in an altemative world. The issues
can be named: pollution of the land and the heart by the cities, unjust proportions of prosperity, narrowing of national sympathies, insularity of scholarship, emnpris. onment of work and creativity. The issues are downright and affronting: Le Corbusier having already said in the nineteen twenties / that architecture properly understood could replace revolution I but we can't even learn in England how concrete slobbers under rain "". Mr. Tarn is neither architect nor guerrilla. By "" beautiful revolution ', he means not silver bullets but an encircling ot all human conditions with inagination; as one says of a stunned patient, we must bring them round. ""The problem "". he writes in the first of 15 sections. ""is to love all without loss of edge.""
His wveapon is anthropology. Taking his cue from the wvork of Levi-Strauss, he uses myth (especially from South America) as a visionary expression and solution of social contradictions. It is solution in the primary sense of getting perspective, getting irnaginative control: the Mayan rain priests reincarnate in times of trouble. the child's story disarms the dark nursery. The vork of Brecht and Andre Breton is an inspiration; the long, flowing line-though sometimes dangerously becalmed and prosycomes from Tarn's own translations of Pablo Neruda (1966); the mythic material is intractable. but
Nathaniel Tarn
boldly used. Beyond anything, the risk is magnificent because it is the genuine alternative, a poetry of exploration.
The same forceful engagement clearly drives the young Scots poet Alan Bold. His first English cotlection, To find the New (1967) was too bitter a polemical tract for the delicate juices of the southern palate, both Marxist and MacDiarmite. Since then his verse has deepened and sweetened, drawing energy from the wvhole Scots movement as can be traced through two excellent publ4 cations ot last wvinter, the
Agenda"" Scottish Issue and the anthology Scottish Poetry 3
(Edinburgh University Press). Now, in A Perpetual Molion Machtine (Chatto & Windus, 18s.! it has become poetry like this:
It darkens. How we sadden as
our planet Leaves the sun again for half A revolution. How we fear
The dark, the turning-away Wc hunger for the glare.
This way we share our world. Only this way ?
Ideal socialism and the imagery of physical sciences substitute for anthropology; but the grasp at immediate issues is the same as Tarn's.
Again the same argument: the poetry waits for us in material conditions: so explore, enlarge the territorv of concern.
Jon Stallworthy is 34, and Root anlid Branch (Chatto & Windus, 18s.) is his third collection. He has written two critical works on Yeats, and his reverence for traditional qualities, the well-turned stanza and the fiercely guarded economic emotion, is wholesome and satisfactory. Compared, however, to a not dissimiliar poet like D. J. Enrigbt (his SeleczeC Poe7us 1953-65 are ako out from C:hatto at 21s.), there is a new. expanding current which probes the human response to cars, telegrams, planes, news photography and other areas of our mechanical enclosure.
Significantly, Mr. Stallworthy is not just shoring up fragments: he has a large central poem ""The Almond Tree"". The subject is
intensely personal, the birth of a mongol son, but there is a quick freedom of imagery which connects sharply to the outside world, as when in the hospital corridor he is told of his son;
This was my first death.
T'hc "" I "" ascending on a slow last thermal breath
studied the man below
as a pilot treading air might
the buckled shell of his planeboot, glove, and helmet fccling no pain
from the snapped wires radiant

I his is tight, closed, intensely private writing, fascinated by physical parts and solitary mental obsession: the ascetic, the nomad, the suicide, the nightmare dreamer.

"Chissell, Joan",Youthful Chopin in all its poetry,The Times,1969-May-12,"London, England","Youthful Chopin in all its poetry
By Joan Chissell
In a recent television interview Artur Rubinstein admitted that all tile preparation in the world would not guarantee a great performance: miracles of that kind just happened -or the reverse. Certainly the gods smiled at the Brighton Festival on Saturday when .Mr. Rubinstein played Beethoven's C minor and Chopin's F minor concertos with the lIondon Symphony Orchestra under Daniel Barenboim-whose respect for the values of an older generation is rare among the young.
It would be difficult to conceive a performance of Chopin's youthful concerto revealing more of its true poetry, less of its indebtedness to the virtuoso note-spinning of Hummel and Moscheles. Mr. Barenboim again (as recently in the Festival Hall for Ashkenazy) did wonders with the much abused accompaniment; cvery note had a reason for being there, and the dialogue between orchestra and keyboard was uncommonly close. But the arch-magician was Mr. Rubinstein, who combined super-sensitive. limpid-toned response to every passing nuance with a touching simplicity of style. It was not to himself but to the 19-year-old Chopin's genius that he drew attention with so much love. There was a similar affecting simplicity in his playing of Beethoven's No. 3. not least in the Largo, marvellously eloquent without recourse to ponderously slow tempo. In the first movement Mr. Barenboim sometimes seemed in search of stronger drama. but again the performance had an invaluable quality of spontaneous creation. So did Leonore III; the offstage trumpets, and the dawning hope from answering orchestra, were uncommonly stirring.
Beethoven from the Czech Philharmonic in the second of its two concerts in the Dome on Friday had not quite the same high voltage, though by the finale of the Eroica the conductor, Vaclav Smetacek, seemed caught up in the Promethean impulse. Earlier. Mr. Smetacek's respectful sincerity, for all its precision, was not galvanic enough to guarantee precise chording or absolute punctuality in solo entries. woodwind sounded a bit too dulcet and vibrato-laden for Beethoven-the oboe also a bit flat. But in place of intensity there was a welcome mellowness in the orchestra's corpotate tone and style, particularly well suited to Dvorak, whose rarely
heard Mass in D v;as the programme's focal point of interest.
Apart from a few passing gcsturcs of formal, fugal piety. Dvorak does not aim at awe-inspiring grandeur here. The work is a tender, personal testament, full of melting lyricism and detailed imaginaiive colouring of keywords (like * Crucifixus ""I and clauses. Friendly angels give car to the balmy kyrie; a contralto soloist launches the Credo like song ; t1lh,re is an evensong sunset glow in the organ introduction to the Benedictus. T-his work drew a much more personal response from Mr. Smetacek. and he had exceliently alert and pliable help from the Brighton Festival Chorus and Sussex University Choir--but they must beware of losing pitch in soft singing.

"Holmes, Richard",Poets from America,The Times,1969-May-10,"London, England","Poets from America
From Mistress Bradstreet to the Boston vniind
Richard Holmes
Not much love has been lost between America and her poets. Pound in the Pisan cage. Robinson Jeffers in his stone tower facing the Pacific. Hart Crane leaping in-
to the Gulf of Mexico. And yet. it has been a truly poetic affair, odi et amo: Pulitzer prizes. Poetry Centres, Guggenheim fellowships, the honour of misquotation in a Presidential address.
Donald Hall's excellent new anthology American Poetry (Faber. I Is.) makes inspired strategic use of this uneasy relationship, knowing full well that something of the same mood exists between America and England. Our objections to Madison Avenue. Vietnam, the Chicago Democratic Convention become irrelevant, even helpful "" No American writer of any value feels that he represents his country""; when he writes a poem ' he commits an un-American activity "". From Anne Bradstreet (Massachusetts. 1612-1672) to Robert Lowell Mr. Hall makes this a vividly attractive collection of wayward, alien spirits (""Whitman the bearded nurse . . . Edgar Poe the necrophiliac Southern gentleman ""). Even Robert Frost.
healthy as a bag of pop corn. is really "" romantic. alienated. egocentric "". stopping by dark woods.
Why not ? It is high time we applied such imaginative intelligence to other points of friction, like the American emphasis on -verse technique. In Modern Poets on Modern Poetry (Fontana. 8s. 6d.), II of the 16 poets are transatlantic. Yet poetical manifestos were once thoroughly English (Sydney, Dryden, Shelley ...); always both sign and explanation of suddenly changing conditions. The most distinctive line of theory here is about a more open, responsive verse, discussed in turn by Pound, Carlos Williams, Frost (another surprise), Cummings (bulging lower case), and most recently Charles Olson (1950). The single paragraph bv Olson on pate 278 explaining how "" the type writer. due to its space precisions. can indicate exactly the breath, the pauses . . . "" is the most simple and helpful explanation of fifty years concern with "" the spoken measure "" so far written. Do read that.
Olson's "" Projective Verse"" essay has proved a kind of Ten
Commandments for the Black Mountain poets (though stylistically more like a ball - game harangue than Exodus). Robert Duncan. himself now 50. is perhaps the. most distinguisbed of these. From the start his approach has been magical and aesthetic:
I make poetry as other men make war or make love or make states or revolutions "". 7he First Decade, 1940-50 (Fulcrum Press, 35s.) begins with a wonderfully rich exploration into a world of idealized power and beauty. Even his women are heraldic-"" their nakedness is like a feud of brilliancies"". But in the long i Venice Poem "". written shortly before discovering Olson (1948), his almost mystical concern for form and energy has reached a critical stage, lovely and yet brittle. rose, ultramarine, rising, falling.
tfhe same wave rolls and reversed unrolls. rolls and reversed-
the dropt cup reappears fron its
fragments,
springs to hanfd as if frvon now-h,re
coitnplet'
Thereafter, to the end of the book and the decade. there is a growing alarm and outgoing alertness which culminates in the fine ""Song of the Border Guard"",
written during the Korean War, clarion. armed-
Thle borderlines of setnse in the
morning light
are naked as a lihe of 7oetry in a
war.
-His second volume, Derivaiions. 1950-56 (Fulcrum Press, 35s.). is much more an experimental note book. including the period when he taught at Black Mountain College. You can follow him as he strips the line down to syllables; tinkers with the voice hesitating, skipping, stalling; writes himself letters on the whole process. You can now also hear him on the magnificent Stream Record L.P. Robert 1Duncan (P1206. 30s. 9d.).
John Berryman. 55, bearded, crotchety eccentric poet of marvellous elegiac wit, is from a different pole in American writing. with its more literary and traditional attractions. His "" Homage to Mistress Bradstreet "" (1956) was based on a passionate liaison with that seventeenth century lady from Massachusetts Bay. Nevertheless, in His Toy His Dream hlis Rest (Faber, 50s.) wbat a voice this too has become:-
I consider a song wvill be as hurmming-
bird
stiii. down-light, missile-inetal-hard,
& strarnge
as the world of anti-matter
where they are wvondering: does time
run backward-
which the poet thought was true.
Scarlalfi-suipple;
but can Henry write it ?
Sometimes, yes indeed. Henry i5 Mr. Berryman's protagonist ("" not the poet, not me ""), speaking or spoken to in as many cases Rs grammar will allow, reminiscent in his multifaced and sensitive furies of Nabokov's Humbert (but without that affliction). In these 308 songs which conclude the "" 77 Dream Songs "" (1964), Henry is turned like a radar bowl on Mr. Berryman's daily trials.and travels. and esp^cially towards growing old amid the deaths of his literary generation - Delmore Schwartz. R.P. Blackmur. Randell Jarrell, Sylvia Plath. So he becomes cast. eften with exquisite rightness, as the confessor to the Confessional Poets-
We are struck down, repear the crtroniclers,
having glowed. Henry from hearsay can vouch for most of this
Leaving the known ivorld with an
awkward kiss
he haunted back aniong his
colleagues in this verse constructed in angry play.
W. S. Merwin. a New York
poet in bis forties, is yet another contrast amid America's infinite variety. In Tlhe Lice (Hart-Davis, 25s.) his style is as bare as boards, empty of literary reference, slow in appraisal. Single lines stand like pools of meditation: "" If you find you no longer believe enlarge the temple"". The rhetoric of earlier work has rubbed away, perhaps because he has been constantly on the move and translating since 1949 - Portugal, France, Majorca, England, and France again. Now his similes leap silently at the throat in the manner of continental surrealism: "" My words are the garment of what I shall never be/Like the tucked sleeve of a one-armed boy.""
And there is still more of America to be found in our Little Presses. I pick out particularly Stephen Jonas's Exercises for tire Ear (Ferry Press, 18s.), an 80-page collection of small ravishing snatches of the Boston sound, witty, wise and immensely skilful, breezy breath from the West

When Yeats died in 1939, Irish poetry did not stop. ALL the same until the late 'fifties, it was a Ian tiTne. The work was carried on almost entirely by two men: Austin Clarke and Denis Devlin, later with the magnificent support of the Dublin publisher Liam Miller and his Dolmen Press. In 1951 Clarke's pamphlet Poetry In Modern Ireland was publi&hed-a brilliant unilateral declaration, full of fight (""Wben Keats turned to mythology, he went to Lempriere's Classical dictionary; our poets went out of doors ""). Seven years later an Oxford Book of Irish Verse appeared-de facto recognition, admnittance to Parnassus.
Devlin, who became a Consul In the Irish Diplomatic Service, was in the great international tradition of Joyce: he studied in Dublin, Munich and at the Sorbonne; worked in Italy, North America and Mexico; translated from Du Bcllay, Goethe, Quasiviodo, Valery, Eluard, Char . . . an endless list. He presented problems of nationality, identity and belief with a surrealism learnt direct from the French, which may well be his greatest gift to later poets like Thomas Kinsella. The Heavenly Foreignzer (Doitren 52s. 6d.) is his last work. a contemplative love poem, published nine years after his death.
Kinsella, born in 1928, is a major representative of the midcentury generation. He first made his name with translations from the Gaelic published in the fifties. and several fine ballad pieces. Among important early pieces is
"" The Baggot Street Deserta "", the poet loaning from his attic window above Dublin. meditating on his art and his nation. Night li'alkler and Other poets (Dolnien. 25s), includes a reprint of his Wormwood sequence, lyric poems of domestic suffering which are haunted by dark intractable sVyIbols of sexual pain
The two trunks in their infinitesinal dance of growth
Have turnld completely about one another, their join
A slowly twisted scar. that I re ise . .
I will dream it stain.
This sequence has already had considerable influence in America, where Mr. Kinsella now lectures.
The new title poem extends the theme of the "" Deserta "", but with a bitterness and terror which is overwhelming. Again, the issue is dispossession: from nation, from love, from one's own mind. The opening section recalls the moment wlien the "" moron voiceless moon"" was torn from the earth, as if it were the formative experience of childhood:It meant little to me then.
Though I remember playing in the
silence
When the rain of fragments dropped
in the streets afterwards
-Bone-splinters, silvery slivers of
screams.
Blood-splinters rattling, like crimson
flint..
This is a powerful and difficult work: Mr. Kinsella advancing to an intensity sometimes close to hysteria.
The pattern of his work is charactcristic in his generation of Irish poets. Exile of the spirit (the

Despite structural confusion and patches of footsore rhetolic, this becomes after several readings a most striking piece that ends with a lovely coda of hope and renewal.
Turning to Brendan Kennelly's collection one realizes just how new and precious such hope is. In Dream of a Black Fox (Allen Figgis, 25s.) the ""white irrational faces"" of the young are apparently ""clawed and screwed with violence "".

Nothling says more for Irish poetry than it has produced mrenwhilc Richard Murphy. The Battle o' Auglhrimn (Faber, 18s.), conmtmissioned by the B.B.C., dovolops directly from Mr. Murphy's previous long sea poems, ""The Last Galway Hooker"" and ""The Cleggan Disaster . 1Hc is now strong enough to abandon nostalgia and savagery for history and judgmcnt.
Aughrim, Horse Ridge, was fought in 1691 between Irish Catholics led by a French marquis and Protestant planters and their Dutch mercenaries. Papal plumes fell before well-deployed money, and 200 more years of colonial repression were sealed. Mr. Murphy leaps at the theme: shuffling time-sequences, characters, points of view, verse forms, he directs the story for hard maximal effects. Cut into unidentified voice among the peasant ranks-
Who cares which foreign king Governs, we'll still fork dung, No one lets us rab soil: Roman or English school Insists it is God
Who must lighten our burden
Digging someone else's garden.-
It is all done with this bold touch: a bright mosaic of incidents drawn to the moment of action, then scattered back up across the centuries. We end with French
tourists re-embarking for Orly airport.
Whioh brings us at last to the new generation, and Derek Mahon who, at 26, publishes -his first book Night Crossing (Oxford, 15s.). This work has taken him from Trinity, Dublin, to Amorica, "" successively a university lecturer, Xerox operator"" and back to Ireland to teach. This is a small but very varied collection, darting in unexpected directions: a studious craftsman's translation of Villon's "" Testament""; persona-poems of de Quincey, Van Gogh, the Vermeer Forger; travel poems in America, and love songs.
There is a fine new freedom here, a sense of available space. Mahon has skill, wit and offhand arrogance. He deals summarily with "" Dowson and Company""the Rhymers Club which included the young Yeats-using one of their own "" sculpted stanzas "": "" Perhaps you found that you had to queu'-For a ticket into hellDespite your sprays of laurel.""
In "" Glengormley "" Mr. Mahon makes his farewell to the heroic landlocked age, with tender sarcasm-
Only words hurt us now. No saint
or hero,
Landing at night from the conspiring
seas,
Brings dangerous tokens to the new
era-
Their sad names linger in the
histories.
The unreconciled, in their meta-

THE PENGUIN BOOK OF VICTORIAN VERSE
John Dixon Hunt
EDITED WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY GEORGE MacBETH
(Penguin Ss)
THE POEMS OF TENNYSON
EDITED BY CHRISTOPHER RICKS
(Longmnans 84s)
George MacBeth's polemic introduction pleads for Victorians who are neither lapsed Romantics nor primitive modernists he is impatient for us to quit the "" insipid truth to life of Whistler "" and celebrate instead the "" spectacular inventiveness "" of Watts and Alma-Tadema. For poetry this requires us to lose those partial views that modern critical taste has contrived and that allow just a few Victorians to become honorary members of the Metaphysical School. And indeed it is rather baffling to see Cleanth Brooks sur. prised by joy at the ambiguities and intricacies of "" Tears, Idle Tears"", yet ignoring totally the uniquely Victorian work, The Princess, from which the lyric comes.
MacBeth argues for the Victorians largely as narrative writers. They sought, he rightly suggests, fictions in which to conceal and yet explore their inward anxieties and obsessions. So we have Meredith's expression of savage, physical frustration in The Nuptials of Attila, more direct. more effective than Modern Love. and the symbolist narrative of Idylls of thze King, though I think MacBeth fails to appreciate how difficult it was for Tennyson to maintain consistently their structure of ""psychological icons "" Arnold's Balder Dead, again contrasted favourably with non-fictive pieces like The Scholar Gipsy, is offered as subjective epic,
though perhaps a more striking example, that MacBeth does not mention at all, would be Morris's Sigurd the Volsung, a terribe lament for a long-lost capacity for real emotion.
Quite properly, The Penguin Book of Victorian Verse is devoted to displaying its editor's thesis and, like all good anthologies, it succeeds magnificently by this vigorous tendentiousness. Both its surprises-Sebastian Evans, Agnes Mary Robinson, Lord de Tabley-and its quirks-a penchant for dialect, and selections from Rossetti, Hardy and Tennyson that do not enforce as strongly as they might the ideas of the introduction-are all part of this volume's determined assault upon our vague defensiveness towards Victorian poetry.
If MacBeth is determined to salvage fragments of a poem or a bad oeurre in order to promote fresh notions of Victorian literature, Christopher Ricks provides all Tennyson's poetry for the first time within one cover (just-there are over 1,850 pages). Here we may trace his career from Poems By Two Brothzers, through much that he rejected after one publication (the magnificent "" Hesperides "". for instance), until "" The Dreamer "", the last poem he finished, in which he laments in dramatic form the conflict between his vision and the iron times and then succumbs (MacBeth's thesis, again) to a less credible, personal lvric of faith in ultimate good. Ricks provides substantial headnotes to each poem on origins, publication and a variety of criticism; footnotes offer a selection of often intriguing textual variants and parallels and allusions to other work-the appropriate passages of Lyell and Chambers, for example, with "" In
Memoriam "". It is a handsome and strenuous editorial achievement. of which perhaps the best testimony is that the apparatus is itself constantly enthralling with its impressions of the poet's public. publishing, creative and private lives, from which one returns with renewed attention to the poems themselves.
Several reflections emerge from this full-scale exposure to one of the two poets without whom no sense can be made of the Victorian age (and when, incidentally, may we expect the other, Browning. in this series of Longman's Annotated English Poets ?) Much of Tennyson's imaginative energies were absorbed in a lifelong, fluctuating effort to render public the resources and tensions of his inner life. The effort is obvious not only in the early poems like "" Mariana "" and "" Ulysses "" but is maintained with magnificent confidence into later poems like "" The Ancient Sage "" (1883) and "" Demeter and Persephone"" (1889). And if Tennyson's best poetry seems to us the dramatizing of the private, wve are perhaps most easily dismnayed by his self-imposed obligation, especially during the Laureate years, to accommodate public themes to poetry; yet his technical resourcefulness makes some of these pieces the best occasional and public verse since Dryden.
Often in apparently direct contrast to his search in myth and other historical narratives for metaphors of his inwardness, there is his dedication to establishing a public typology of Victorian incident and circumstance by which to generalize his vision. The Spectator of 1850 praised his "" pictures of common landscape and of daily life "" without realizing, as we now car, how these very images of spiritualized commonplace convey and accommodate the forms which Tennyson most eagerly apprehended:
... imperishable presences serene
Colossal, without form, or sense, or
sound,
Dim shadows but unwaning

THE MODERN POET: Essays reprinted from the Revieiv
EDITED BY IAN HAMILTON (Macdonald 35s)
MODERN POETRY: a personal essay
BY LOUIS MACNEICE (Oxford 38s)
Poetry has always been and always will be, in Eliot's lines, a raid on the inarticulate or an "" intolerable wrestle with words and meanings."" But perhaps those who too emphatically place the emphasis upon ""intolerable"" should have the grace to pack it in and grow roses or something. Now. too often, the wrestle has become more important than the words. with critics squatting round the tussling-mat eagerly noting down each slippery, inconclusive hold. We are inundated with poems about not writing poems. There are grunting little rhythms acknowledging that, if there is anything meaningful left to say, the poet does not know how to say it.
And so like almost any othez declining sect, or impoverished party, poetry and its attendant swarm of cotinmentators is greatly given to public declarations of intent, regeneration, manifestos and new movements. Critics not only like to cut up cadavers, thev also delude themselves into the belief that by examining the entrails they might somehow transplant a new set of innards into the whole putretying bag of driedup skin.
When A. Alvarez gathered together some moderately good modern verse about seven years ago he called it TIhe Neiv Poetrv and introduced the collection with the kind of spare-part surgery
implied in the preceding paragraph. Beyond The Gentility Principle, he said-and to say something like that you cannot afford to be anything other than aggressive. By the time the Revised Edition came round in 1966, he acknowledged that there was an inevitable gap between 'the generally rather sober verse and the inflammatory introduction "".
Alvarez himself--if onlly to judge by the poem printed at the back of The Modern Poet-is not much of a hand at writing the actual stuff. But if we started chopping up critics in this way there would be almost nothing left to fill the still multiplying acres of higher literary journalism. Better to read inflammatory prose than sober, not to say genteel, verse.
"" Here is a collection of essays, lively, lucid and distinguished"" begins the blurb which introduces this selection of re-published article from the Review. Lucid however, is very low down in the list of appropriate adjectives. Prose too. can turn out to be an "" intolerable wrestle "", this time with words far more than with meanings.
Graham Martin, for instance, seems to approach a poem with a dictionary in his hand, which is the nearest literary equivalent I can think of to pulling the legs off a spider or-if you prefer a more romantic mode-the wings off a butterfly. His piece on Roy Fuller objects to the use of the word "" lust "" in one of the poems, claiming it to be ""one of those unusable words, which should be forcibly retired"". I might, with that similar precision which so cleverly camouflages imprecision. question the adverbs in the quoted sentence.
It was no vague nostalgia which
I breathed
Between the purple colloids of the
air.
Martin says this sounds quite pleasant till you look up the meaning of "" colloid "". Among things a colloid is ""a sticky gelatinous substance having the consistency of glue "". Fuller. he says, was "" lucky to have been able to breathe at all "". Other, and worse examples of such word-picking followwhole colloids of obtuseness so gelatinous that it sets into something which, for me, illustrates more clearly than anything else the essential, if apparently wobbly, difference between those who create and those who can t.
But the opening essay in the book, "" Dreams and Responsibilities "", is brilliant. Colin Fakck here faces full on to the permanent problems of poetry and the afflicted sensibilities of the contemporary poet. He engages with the things that matter, rather than wvith individual syllables or crossword-filling nonsense. He sees that poetry, far from just conveving the shock or desperation of living godless and almost hopeless in our modern mess, must search out meaning and vision through our experience of others. We still need a real commitment to the human world and its conflicts. Poetry must assume ""its full role as the origin and continuous recreation of our morality and our understanding '.
That sounds. again, like manifesto-mongering: but Failck is precise enough in his examples and tight enough in hi5 arguments to make it seem otherwise. Even so he is a critic who accepts that ""the only test of criticism in the end is whether we can give
rationality to something we already dimly feel "". The creative writer, by contrast. is surely more concerned with pulling out and articulating what we already dimly feel, ambiguities. irrationalities, contradictions and all.
Louis MacNeice began the last chapter of his 1938 book, Modern Poetry, with the ever timely observation that "" writing about poetry often becomes a parlour game. The critic is more interested in producing a water-tight system of criticisms than in the objects which are his data."" MacNeice's often dogmatic and propagandist book, now reissued in an attractive new edition, survives the old arguments and the withered enthusiasms of that perilous decade to read with surprising freshness, exuberance and-most stai tling of allambiguity.
Ah, but he could write worthwhile poems. That's why. The combination of these two booksand the increasing sense I have of the unalterable impertinence of weekly reviewing-finally persuades me that I too should pack it in. Not to grow roses, but to turn whatever equipment I may have towards the regenerative process concerned with ""tthe origin and continuous recreation of our morality and our understanding "".
Arrogance is sometimes better than impertinence. But I refuse to look up either word in the dictionary. I am not yet Morocco bound.

THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF WILLIAM CARLOS WILLIAMS
(Mac(iibbon and Kee 63s)
It is a peculiarity of poetry, among all the arts, that you can not only make poems of the kind vou intend to but also make them ont of the experience of trying to and failing. William Carlos Williams has written fine poems of both kinds.
Some of his poems succeed. as he would want thean to, in grasping and rendering "" thinRs "". But more often, when he succeeds. what be Is rendering is moments of baffled conviction in the face of ""things ""-moments when the complete beauty is there. at a hair's distance, ready to be clasped, but what the words grasp is the perfect conviction rather than the "" thing "" itself
That remarkable poem "" A morning imagination of Russia"" dramatizes what is clearly a common experience for him-a fumbling progress from "" the feeling/ that there is a piece of glazed paper/between me and the paper"" to the desired state when
... We have paid heavily. Bat we have gotten-touch. The eves and the cars down on it. Close.
The poem is an achieved work of art. His Autobiography (published in America as long ago as 1951, though the* publishers oddly don't mention this) is not quite that, but it has the same pattern. It funbles, things come in a bit at random; at the best it's what the theory of ""Projective Verse "" would call a * field "", and at the worst it's an old man rambling; and then, a number of times, excitement sets in, the prose
leaps into life, and something is said with great force and genius.
The theme which really engages WiUiams, who spent most of his life as a general practitioner in Rutherford, New Jersey, is "" Medicine and Poetry "". His theory of poetry is inextricably tied up with his theory of a doctor's duty. The doctor listens. He loses himself in his patient; he becomes himi, so that when he detaches himself again it is like reawakening from sleep. And what he is listening for, and what the patients are trying to communicate, is a poem, ""the poem which their lives are being lived to realize "".
It is actually there, in the life before us, every minute that we arc listening, a rarest element-not in our imaginations but there, there in fac. it is that essenoe which is hidden in the very words which are going in at our ears and from which we must recover underlying meaning as realistically as we recover metal out of ore.
A very un-Wordsworthian and un-Eliot-like view of poetry: for, in their own ways, both the Symbolist and the Romantic poet claim the right to exploit reality, transmuting it into something elsc or applying it to their own egocentric concerns (what did the Old Cumberland Beggar ever get out of Wordsworth ?). Whereas the essence of Williams's theory is respect for reality. But it is a theory which his whole life, as well as his work, gives a kind of backing to.
These passages on poetry and doctoring, and on the general artistic revolution to which he belongs (' the making of that step, to come over into the tactile qualities, the words themselves beyond the mere
thought expresed ""), together with a curious, semi-successful attempt to discuss a friend's house, without metaphor, as a poem, are the heart of the book.
As for the rest, it's hit and miss. He manages to say fairly little about the Paris of Stein, Hemingway and Joyce; and not al that much about Pound, who was an intimate friend, though he beautifuly catches his swagger. For a lot of the time the style is help. less and cliche-ridden; there are various kinds of information he never troubled to learn how to *-ut into prose at all. Nor has he any objection if anecdotes turn out to ihave no point; the profoundest stories have no point.
... I never wanted to be a surgeon, Marvellous men-I take off my hat to themn. I knew one once who whenever he'd get into a malignant growth would take a hunk of it and rub it into his armpit afterward. Never knew why.
It's a ramshackle book only if you want to think of it as ramshackle, for the meaningfulness of the life it records gives it point. You sense this strongly in the final chapter, which has a very strange quality. Williams takes his grandson to revisit the scene of his magnus opus, Paterson. It is winter, and the brink of the falls at Paterson has grown a crop of ice-globes, as big as a man's head. His grandson, who all through the drive has kept looking out hopefully for dangers, is thrilled. He manages to grub up one of these ""hell-cabbages "", and he and his grandfather start hurling them furiously on to the ice below. This little coda to Paterson is as fine as anything in the poem itself.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS336556075/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=13ea2b76

William Rees-Mogg
ALEXANDER POPE: The education of a genius
BY PETER QUENNELL
(Weidenfeld and Nicolson 63s)
Alexander Pope's character was as antithetical as his verses. There is hardly any statement one can make which cannot be countered by its opposite. Pope had a genius for friendship but his quarrels with those who had been his friends were as bitter as with his enemies. Pope was psychologically marked -by the crippling disease of his childhood-he was only 4ft. 6in. high-but his early years were spent in extremely happy family life. Pope had no understanding of theoretical philosophy yet the Essay on Man is the only major didactic poem on a philosophical theme in English.
This series of contradictions and the contrast, which Peter Quennell brings out, between his ambition to be a good man and his inability to manage it. makes the life of Alexander Pope a fascinating adjunct to his poetry. His life has been written many times and we have more evidence about him than about any but a very few of our major literary figures. Although he was born only 124
years after Shakespeare, the reliable knowledge we have about every aspect of his life is in total at least a hundred times as great as the evidence we have about Shakespeare. This mass of evidence is almost as bewildering as the shifts of his intrigues.
Mr. Quennell has written a life which has the feeling for character of a good novelist. His method is entirely scholarly and he has relied throughout on the latest available work on Pope's life, and particularly no doubt on the letters. The effect is to bring out the character in a living way and particularly the character while it was still forming, Pope's character as a child and as a young man.
This book, like Professor Sherburne's excellent wvork. is the life of Pope as a young man. Peter Quennell takes Pope to the age of 40 and Professor Sherburne left him rather carlier than that The three major monuments of his poetry in this period are The Rape of the Lock, the translation of Homer and The Dunciad. Mr. Quennell is at his best in dealing with The Rape of the Lock, which he obviously enjoys and finds delightful. He gives a good account of the translation of
Homer. though he is rather less successful in bringing out its poetic quality and he seems to feel affection for Thze Dunciad.
From his earliest work Pope had developed the peculiar intensity of expression which is his particular virtue. There is no English poet who can press so much meaning into each phrase while retaining such complete clarity. He is also, like Shakespeare, though his range is less wide, primarily a poet of human nature. By a peculiar aberration of critical judgment, the romantic critics thought that inanimate nature-daffodils and mountains-were poetic in a sense that human nature and human society was not.
Perhaps it was the development of the novel after the publication of Pamela in 1742 that gave authors a different and more flexible form for the portrayal of character. Yet for those who find human nature a subject of inexhaustible interest, Shakespeare and Pope are the two inexhaustible English poets. Peter Quennell has succeeded in bringing out the character of a poet whose first belief was ""the proper study of mankind is man ""-",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS302870564/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=26266761

The UJnder-read Classics: Wordsworth
So honourably born
""There are several reasons why his
poetry is so little respected by the young... and one of them is that he does not
write for them."" Margaret Drabble
rescues Wordsworth from the tyranny of the examination syllabus and finds that,
uneven as they are, his works show enough intelligence, insight and unease
to make them company for a lifetime.
Perhaps it is Impertinent to describe Wordsworth as underread: but under-read, misread and under-enjoyed by me he certainly was for years, and I can't help feeling that others like myself were diverted at school from a true liking by rn-considered readings of The Daffodils and totally incomprehensible passages from that profound and obscure work, The Prelude.
When I looked, years later, at the Lyrical Ballads, they appeared to me in a light of revelation: I had not expected to find anything so moving, so deeply felt, so highly intelligent, so courageous. And from this new beginning I was led to the later works, and to the whole magnificent, consciously endured curve of ascendancy and decline that marks his poetic output.
There are several reasons why his poetry is so little respected by the young who read him dutifully for the examination syllabus; and one of them is that he does not write for them. He is not a poet Nvho writes with violent or accessible optimism or despair. He writes a great deal about children and adolescents, but not for them: he writes reflectively, and from a stoic experience of maturity. Even his earliest poems are marked with resignation and endurance. Many teachers, themselves charmed by the recaptured and recreated sensations of youth in The Prelude, must have thought it a poem that would communicate easily; and Wordsworth is also suitable for teaching in that he never writes about sex, being, as Byron and Shelley pointed out, a solemn and unsexual man, "" a kind of moral eunuch "".
But in a sense these very qualities disqualify him as a candidate for juvenile enthusiasm: the passions he describes are peculiarly those of maturity, and childhood in his works is always seen through adult eyes. A large section of his poems was grouped, by himself, under the title ""Poems
of the Affections n-and It b startling to note how many of these deal with parental love, often betrayed or harassed; and of all the passions this is perhaps the least sympathetic to the nonparticipant, being a notoriously one-way emotion. Even the loveliest evocations of it, the most lyrical, are inaccessible: the last two stanzas of The Affliction of Margaret, for instance, which seem now to me to be among the most touching he ever wrote, and which unite simplicity and dignity of diction with striking human insight, used to leave me quite unmoved: the last of these says (the mother is speaking of her lost son)
Beyond participation bie
My troubles, and beyond relief: If any chance to heave a sigh,
They pity me, and not my grief.
-and this is precisely the point, her troubles are beyond participation, at least to the uninitiated.
And other, less tender and conventional pieces do not even invite participation, for Wordsworth never shies away from describing the more homely and indeed, to some, ludicrous instances of affection-that of the mother for her idiot child, that of the cheerful Matron of Jedburgh for her mute and paralysed husband. And this leads to another of the reasons why his work repels so many: he is not afraid of the ridiculous, whereas there is nothing that schoolchildren more suspect and dislike. Some of his poems, such as the Idiot Boy, The Thorn, Simon Gray, and We Are Seven, arouse nothing but derision in the classroom, and beyond it.
Wordsworth did not escape criticism for these works even in his lifetime, and from his most syrnpathetic critics: a friend tried to dissuade him from including We Are Seven in the Lyrical Ballads, saying, prophetically, that it would lay him open to everlasting ridicule, but he replied mildly that it must take its chance.

tress. His sister Dorothy nursed him back to health from the mental breakdown that this experience helped to cause, and he transferred his affections to her: too violently and dangerously, one cannot doubt, as her diaries and his Lucy poems show. Dorothy presided over the rest of his emotional life: she went with him to Calais to arrange the future of his French daughter, she stood by while he married (and it was certainly not a marriage of passion) Mary Hutchinson, and she lived with him and his wife for the rest of her life.
These facts speak to me of a damming up or diversion of natural sexual energy, which is perhaps one of the causes for the feeling of imminent loss of power lhat pervades the poetry he wrote in his mid-thirties. He aged early, physically : and Dorothy, in her fifties, fell ill and suffered for the next 30 years, which she spent confined to a wheel chair, from recurring bouts of mental illness. Wordsworth himself suffered from various psychosomatic afflictions, and one can only guess at the pent emotions that took their vengeance in that apparently peaceful household. Almost unbearably poignant to read, now, is a short poem written for Dorothy in youth, wvhich projects Wordsworth's ideal of old age:
Thy thoughts and feelings shall
not die, Nor leave thee, when grey hairs
are nigh, A melancholy slave;
Blut an old age, serene and bright, And lovely as a Lapland night Shall lead thee to the grave.
So few of Wordsworth's images of content were fully achieved: his friends and his beloved daughter Dora predeceased him, his poetic vision failed him, and he was left alone, grimly surviving, solitary and eccentric, stoically upholding the virtues of companionship and normality. It was not for nothing that he wrote at the age of 32:
We poets in our youth begin in
gladness. But thereof come in the end
despondency and madness. In fact, the whole of his middle period is marked by a sense of almost willed foreboding: he willed upon himself a living death, as he willed upon Lucy/Dorothy a poetic death. Occasionally, a gleam of his bitter awareness shows through the endeavour to survive: as when he looks at the dying celandine, "" and in his spleen, he smiled that it was grey "".
Finally, I think it is this acknowledgment of the process of loss that I most admire in him: he accepts it, as he accepts mutability, dissolution, decay, vicissitude, flux, the whole ebb and flow of grace-all words drawn from his own vocabulary. His works, uneven though they are, are not merely the blossoming of one brief period: they chart and span a lifetime, they are company for a lifetime.
Wordsworth, effectively dissuaded him from making his blind Highland boy set out upon the water in a common bathtub (as he did in fact), and Wordsworth obligingly substituted a turtle shell for the bathtub: but some may feel his original adherence to the bathtub more truly decorous.
He defended the subject matter of The Idiot Boy in a long, celebrated and eloquent letter to John Wilson, which is one of his finest pieces of prose: and when Sarah Hutchinson, his sister-in-law, wrote to him that the leech gatherer in Resolution and Independence talked too much about nothing much, be rebuked her insensitivity with characteristic and daunting confidence:
You speak of his speech as tedious . . . it is in the character of the old man to tell his story in a manner which an impatient reader must necessarily feel as tedious. But Good God ! Such a figure, in such a place, a pious, self-respecting, miserably infirm Old Man telling such a tale ! My dear Sarah, it is not a matter of indifference whether you are pleased with this figure and his employment.
One cannot fail to admire the sheer strength of his moral and artistic judgments, and in his successful period at least they are powerfully united.
But perhaps tho greatest bar to an early admiration, and the most lasting inducement to it, is not bis subject matter or his indifference to ridicule but the fact that he is a poet of process, of growth, of change. His poems chart the growth of his own mind, from its earliest enthusiasms and terrors, through its social awakening, to its gradual disappointment and resignation; from the ardent revolutionary to the distributing of stamps for Westmorland, and the Laureateship.
Many images in
the water
Many of his greatest poems have an internal process and growth, a sense of motion and natural development, that are unrivalled in any other poet. He is a nature poet, indeed, but not merely the landscape poet and flower painter that the Victorians admired: he charts the unexpected but inevitable movements of the mind. and those movements, as he describes them, are never mechanical or rationally supposed: they are felt, they are real, they have the authority of experience. In the sonnet Sutrprised by Joy, the movement from momentary hope. through sickening remembrance of loss, to hopeless grief, is conveyed with such natural ease and such fidelity that the reader shares and endures 'Aith the poet the whole cycle of emotion.
On a larger scale, the whole of The Prelude (which is sub-titled Growth of a Poet's Mind) is an
exploration of change, not chronologically or clinically recounted, but relived and passionately questioned and recreated. The structure of the poem itself reflects this exploration: it is not logical or carefully planned, it flows and returns and makes detours, with the movement (to use an image which he himself constantly uses) of a river. The poem is full of developed images that describe the natural, organic processes of perception; there is one in which he compares the process of memory, of looking into past time, to "" one who hangs down-bending from a boat "", who sees in the water many images...
Yet often is perplexed, and cannot
part
The shadow from the substance,
rocks and sky,
Mountains and clouds, from that
which is indeed
The region, and the things which
there abide
In their true dwelling; now is
crossed by a gleam
Of his own image, by a sunbeam
now....
and there is another, similar one in which he describes his first impressions Of London, and their slow growth, as those of a man who enters a cavern with torches, and at first is confused, then thinks he sees the roof and all the details ""1 exposed and lifeless as a written book ""; but who then looks again, and finds
a new quickening shall succeed, at
first
Beginning timidly, then creeping
fast
Through all which he beholds; the
senseless mass,
In its projections, wrinkles,
cavities . . .
Unites, embodying everywrhere
sonie pressure
Or image, recognized or new,
some type
Or picture of the world ...
Both these images describe beautifully the act of perceiving: the shifting layers of awareness, the ebb and flow of reality and vision.
Wordsworth is a peculiarly truthful poet: he never claims to see what he cannot see, he reports faithfully the limitations, as weLl as the dim extents of his revelations, and his total work is very far in effect from the abstractions that represent him in some anthologies. He is never afraid to expose his own ignorance: his description of his changing feelings towards the French Revolution is both an impressive historic account and an impressive piece of selfcriticism.
He has also a great gift for capturing the irrational, the casually and not causally connected images that speak to him and constitute his moments of power: Resolution and Independence is a perfect example of a poem which seems to tell a story, but which in fact, as do so many incidents in The Prelude. presents instead a fusion of internal emotions and external landscape, an illogical yet wholly significant conjunction oI passion and event. Several of his best pas-
sages are based upon moments trivial or seemingly trivial, that widen out into meaning with a kind of spreading flow: as when the Woman in Scotland says to him. ""What, you are stepping Westward ? "" or the man on the mountain informs him that. without noticing it, he has already crossed the Alps: both remarks at once factual and portentous. both incidents at once trivial, historic, and symbolic.
Wordsworth perhaps best deserves to be described as a nature poet because his images, incidents, and thought processes are natural: they are drawn from nature. they are not yoked by violence together, they show both the psychological insight of the great nineteenth-century novelists, and the organic wholeness of the scenery which inspired him.
The trials of
human affection
Another reason why some fail to admire Wordsworth is a charge that can be laid at his door only: it is that he wrote such a vast quantity of bad and indifferent poetry, and betrayed, in doing so, some of his own finest principles. How a man who wrote as he did of poetic diction could have ended up composing lines like ""Thine is the tranquil hour, purpureal Eve"" is hard to imagine. But to an addict like myself, even these lapseswith the exception, perhaps, of the sequence of sonnets in praise of capital punishment-have a certain power, because they are in a sense so much a part of the cycle that began with such energy, and because the reasons for the decay, appear to have been so human, so inevitable, and so honourably born. They are part of a whole.
There has been much speculation about the causes for Wordsworth's poetic decline, and the sad truth is that the value of his poems can be roughly assessed by a quick glance at the date: anything before 1805 is well worth attention. anything between 1805 and 1820 is worth attention, and anything after 1820 is for enthusiasts only. The causes for this falling off can of course never be known. but it seems to me that he was, in a way, trapped by his own ethic, and by his own affiliations. He had thrown in his lot with human affection, and he had to endure its trials. He suffered very greatly from the death of his brother John in 1805, as various elegies bear witness, and also from the death of two of his children in infancy: but most of all he must have suffered for his sister Dorothy, who at one time appeared to him as his salvation.
One can only speculate about Wordsworth's sexual nature: the facts are that while he was in France at the age of 21 he fell in love with a French girl, Annette Vallon, who bore him a daughter, and whom he abandoned, reluctantly, in great dis-",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS285437838/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=9f8bd85c
"Thwaite, Ann",Asking to be read,The Times,1968-Nov-09,"London, England","Asking to be read
Few chuldren nowadays miss the chance of reading really good twentieth-century poetry at schooL If there are still some teachers around like the one David Holbrook knew, who ridiculed Lawrence's "" Snake "" and forbade the reading of ""modern stuff"", there are many more who use the new anthologies, which contain a majority of work written nearer five years ago than 45. It's usually good modern stuff, too; the days of empty poems about goblins and jolly farmers are over. Nature poems need no longer be about larches in gay green gowns and nuts ripe-brown which come tumbling down.
But what about the children's
bookshelves at home ? Tha chances are that among the alluring new picture-books and storybooks, poetry is represented by a 1928 edition of Come Hither in faded maroon, with its spine loose. Parents with guilty consciences would do well to buy a new book: D. H. Lawrence Poems selected for young people by William Cole (Macmillan 21s.). There are some odd inclusions including some poor poems, but all the right ones are there and the book asks to be read, with its scarlet jacket, strange black illustrations and well-spaced lines.
There are poems here which can mean something (quite a lot) to a child as young as eight, including ""'Snake"", of course, and the extraordinary ""Tortoise Family Connections"". Older children will begin to understand what Lawrence meant when he called thought ""man in his wholeness fully attending "".
With his "" hidden emotional patterns "", Lawrence has recently been called a highly dangerous model for young writers of verse. I wonder if he really is. At least in his best poems he keeps his eye solidly on the subject, despising self-importance and overstatement. Gregory Harrison, whose Posting Letters (Oxford, 15s.) is a collection of new poetry specially written for children, would be a far worse model. He himnself is at his best when he is most simple. He writes of men, come to clear the site of a Roman camp for building, "" running coarse thumbs along axe blades/ and looking coldlylat the useless trees"". His poem ""The Snipe"" ends ""And I was glad/they'd pulled me from my chair to see/ this creature feeding/so fastidiously "". But mostly he is too dense, too clotted, over-loaded with clever-clever phrases.
Nonsense Is a good thin end of the wedge for offspring affecting to dislike poetry; there is no denying that it is poetry but few can persist in disliking it. William Cole, the Lawrence editor, has compiled an excellent bedside book, Oh What Nonsense (Methuen 16s.), embellished with marvellously apt line drawings by Tomi Ungerer. There are a few familiar faces here (Sir Smasham Uppe's and those of Milligan's thousand hairy savages) but most are unknown, American, and well worth getting to know. Cole has deliberately avoided including Lear and Carroll because they are so readily available.
Those who want the Carroll poems away from the prose can now buy Jabberwocky and other poems with lots of full colour by Gerald Rose (Faber 18s.).

RY E. E.. CUMMINGS
(MacGibbon and Kee, 2 volumes, 63s each)
The verdict of his own generation seems to be: well, hand him down C:atullus' old laurels. For the man ix-ho wrote twelve books of poetry, tWo autobiographical novels, several plays and. stories and cssays. it is a bit dusty.
Edward Estlin Cummingspoet-painter. born Cambridge. Mlassachusetts 1894: lived in Paris. New York. and New EngLand: died September. 1962-was that unforgivable thing, a Romantic. All his life he believed in himself and other individuals, rather than the sublime generalities of Marxism or Heaven or the United States or Literature: "" nobody in general and someone in particular is incorrigibly and actually alive "". Pound (who believed in Literature) had his ideas tested to the breaking point in the cage
-t Pisa, when he was 55; but Cummnings was on the anvil at 23, just out of Harvard.
For five months in the winter of 1917 he endured a concentration camp at La FertW lacd where he was herded and frozen and starved by the French (for whom he had volunteered to serve in the Ambulance Corps). In a situation which Kafka or Camus would have turned into a grey nauseous, nightmare. Cummings continued to make notes and sketches, and five years later, with the help of T. E. Lawrence and RFobert Graves, he published The !5normous Room, a book of irrepressible gaiety and grip, reissued this year (MacGibbon and Kee 36s).
At La Ferte, Cummings found the beliefs that carry all his writing. He found that the lyrical subsists even to the extremities of fear and filth, and is therefore real. He found in the personalities of his fellowv inmates an unassailable fortress of value. (There are four tigures especially, described, after Bunyan as The Delectable Mountains: a gyppsy. a Polish mute, the camp fool. and the magnificent childlike Jean Le Negre. These are the first occupants of what becomes in the poetry a denfirnonde gallery of balloonmen, whores, knifeiliarpeners and tramps.
Besides being a Romantic, Cummings was all his life a
painter. This has also proved awkward. The connexion between mnodern painting and modern poetry, while familiar to Frenchmen such as Apollinaire, Breton and Aragon (whom Cummings knew and translated), is obscure in English. We tend to think back to George Herbert's wing and altar-shaped poems, and remain puzzled. But Cummings was at home in Paris. and intimate in European art. His first published paper (Harvard. 1915) was a comparison of Cubism and Futurism with modern verse technique. In his Comnplete Poems we have at last the ful range of his achievement and example, which might well be seen as analogous to Paul Klee's.
Like Klee, Cummings settled on the childlike vision as the essential one, which is the characteristic strength of
all ignorance toboggans into know and trudges up to ignorance again: but winter's not forever, even snow melts; and if Spring should spoil
the game, what then ?
as weU as such devastating notorieties as: "" A politician is an arse upon/which everyone has sat except a man."". Like Klee, he discovered the value of neverending experiment / games, of inspired ceaseless tinkering with his materials. (There are 175 extant manuscript drafts of the poem ' rosetree, rosetree"" in Volume 11). And like Klee, he allowed kinesis. the movement of the "" active line "" to shape his composition. to destroy the literal surface, to carry everything before it. Cummnings's line is always jumping about, scattering letters and punctuation marks, rushing down the page in a shower of syllables.. Brackets serve to drop the voice, or raise an eyebrow; spare words pun-up with each other; even individual letters sometimes mobilize (as here), helping the moon to get up.

Cummings said he used "" intelligence at intuitional velocitv"". Surely he has nmore to teach our concrete pocts than any computer ?
tn 7fthree Pl/avs and X Bildlet (Peter Owen, 37s. 6d.), he is working fruitfully on other frontiers. though the connexion with the poetry is direct. (In the collection ""Is 5"" of 1922. he had written:
""Like the burlesque comedian I am abnormally fond of that precision which creates movement "".) HiJim, the major play here, has a
good deal of the burlesque, moreof the Absurd. and the headlong swiftness, of the revue. It is in three Acts. dominated by a lover's dialogue (the artist and the women) closely, playfully and sweetly written as a dreamlike search for identity. The discussion is punctuated by the unlikely advent of three Miss Weirds-rocking chairs and knitting-and various contemporary social phenomena (1927) in light disguise: bread mobs, capitalists and drunks,
fascists and fairies and Englisb-. men on tours, Americans ("" mostpeople"") in Montmartre ordering ""sham pain "". Frankie and Johnnie in Harlem. and others.
In the lovers' dialogue. there is a typical outburst:
Thc average ""painter "", poet "" '*playwright"" .. is a person who cannot leap through a hoop from the back of a galloping horse, make people laugh with a clown's. mouth.. . But imagine a human being who balances three chairs on top of another., on a wire. eighty feet in the air with no net underneath, and then climbs to the top chair ...
Cummings's fantasia show his absolute modern relevance again: it is precisely the poet as performer. as acrobat. as clown (and perhaps, hopefully, as magician) which now fascinates us.
Ever since R. P. Blackmur delivered his attack on Cummings in the thirties-a sensationalist. incapable of moving beyond posies -there has been something of a conspiracy to underestimate or ignore what he actually managed. But now the books are available. a great store of experiment and joy, waiting to be drawn on. Moreover, Cummings has been a harbour of tradition, too: no other modern American poet has used rhyme and regular Iyric metres as he has done; or written so many fine sonnets (pate Bcrrvman}-a skill he learnt from Rossetti. In the last pages of his poems there is an overwhelming sense that his life and work had rung true for him:

By Stanley Sadie
In what was probably the longest ever Prom----it started at 4.30, ended after 10.0-the B.B.C. gave us yesterday The Trojans, complete to the last note: a splendid anticipation of next year's Berlioz centenary. Not many operas can be expected to go so well in concert performance. True, spectacle and atmosphere are a vhal part of it. as with every French Vrand opera; but the static, essentially non-developing character of much of the work represents another aspect of the French classical tradition. The Albert Hall, oratorio's home, did not seem a bad place for these grand tableaux. for these noble human beings inexorably steered by forces outside themselves.
And in quite another way, too. Trhe Trojans responds to concert performance: Berlioz's marvellously subtle and fantastically varied score comes over with a clarity and sparkle one could hardly hope for from a pit.
1 he performance itseif was Masnificent. Colin Davis, of course, conducted: he drew almost uniformly superlative playing from the L.S.O.. and shaped the more

The l..S.O. Chorus. with Chelsea Opera Group members, sang finely too. particularly in the big ceremonial scenes, but sounded a bit elephantine (it is aboiit 175 strong)
There was much first-rate solo singing: among the secondary roles I was speciallv struck bv Anna Reynolds's sensitive, shapely sustained lines in Anna's music. Ryland Davies's sweetly nostalgic singing of Hvlas's lament, Delme Bryn-Jones's clear if not particularty poetic account of Choroebus's part. Amy Shuard made a strong Cassandra. though it obviously does not lie ideally for her. Dido was the accomplished and dependable Josephine Veasey--- not quite thrilling, as yet, though her duets with Anna and Aeneas were perhaps the evening's best things, vith lovely soft, poetic iinging: Aeneas was Ronald Dowd, a strong. characterful. involved performance, the words (it vas sung in English) excellently enunciated.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS68382498/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=932e80ea

Britten's haunting poetry
Royal Opera House: Billy Budd
By Benjamin Britten
Not many contemporary operas pull as fiercely on basic feelings as Billy Budd; it is one of the most difficult works to write about, one where the task of intellectualizing and verbalizing emotions is desperately hard.
That I should have to begin a notice of last night's Covent Garden revival with such an apologia may perhaps testify to the performance's impact. The fearful, haunting poetry of the work can not often have been more fully realized. Though the opera is not. to my mind, wellproportioned in its revised two-act version-the seamen's acclamation of "" starry Vere "" has diminished point, the final scene of Act I seems prolonged in the context and the hanging scene disproportionately (if mercifully) brief. Still, it emerges as one of the sharpest, most forceful portrayals of AngloSaxon attitudes: of the subduing of emotion, of the relationships between men in a closed community, of love and hate. compassion and cruelty, corruption and martyrdom.
The principal roles were taken by the same artists as in the first performances, four years ago, of the two-act version. Robeit Kerns
makes a warm, fresh Billy, all innocence and simplicity; but I wish his vords came across more clearly (an American is at a disadvantage when ears are tuned to English diction). Forbes Robinson's Claggart is masterly: not merely deep and cavernous of voice, but wi.h a kind of stillness of heart, fixity of purpose, which bear home his darkness (whether or not his soliloquy, rationally speaking, makes sense). Captain Vere was sung by Richard Lewis, particularly impressively in the framing scenes for the r eminiscing old man, slightly less so in the main action. where there was some want of both resolutioand reflectiveness; V'ere is surely a bigger character than he suggested. There were some very fine sketches of the smaller roles; I can single out only John Shaw on the upper deck, Delme Bryn-Jones down below.
Britten's score responds splendidly to Georg Solti's conducting: 1 admired not only his handling of the vivid moments or the taut ones (like the court-martial scene) but more particularly of the quieter ones-the scene after the flogging, the soft, sustained low strings behind the officers' conversation in Vere's cabin. the delicate placing of those suggestive triads when Vere goes to tell Budd his fate. Ande Anderson has rehearsed the production, to excellent effect, it is full of touches which add point and depth to the action.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS302477044/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=81a9d064

"Holmes, Richard",Poetry: inside history of small conflicts,The Times,1968-Jun-29,"London, England","k Poetry: inside history of small conflicts
Behind the student's public battle, the parents' private one. Behind any door, the tight inside history of small conflicts a family has, stretching back through each generation. The struggle of a few close-knit lives with poverty, respectability, hard work, illness, love. And behind one door is the remarkable Family Albusn (London Magazine Editions, lOs. 6d.) of Brian Jones.
It opens with Aunt Emily, growing up in the backstreets of North London before the First World War. Spinsterhood is waiting for her. She is lonely, generous, a little mad:
Eldest. Little old lvolnan from
thte start ... Liked the wa(y cats padded
for food, padded off, kept
neat, Wvere ill in corners.
Mother wvorked. I fed kids, kissed, soaped them, shoved all into bed. And it
wvas horses and cats I loved.
Then the rest of the family. Grandad marooned and asthmatic in his grate-side armchair after' a lifetime on tropical seas. Uncle Fred, snarling through his last teeth at the loss of the Boer War, of the Empire, of his own dignitv. Pretty Ada--' family-treasured like the Klondyke nugget brought
home by Uncle Fred "". Bill, -her husband, who moves out to the suburbs, makes good, wears a bowtie at the boss's party. And finally the new generation,, their son David, who goes to University, breaks with his background, and remembers his wedding with laughter:
tottering and dignified, her tribe
(all well-to-do) watchzed over thze glass-rims
warily the reined and ominous exuberance of all mny lot-
pink hats exploding flowers. low-born, squat
Brian Jones writes with passionate colloquial sympathy about incidents we all recognize, the daily pressures behind living in England now. Using a series of dramatic monologues - funny, sour or lyrical-he does that most difficult thing, tell a story at direct poetic intensity. Like Aunt Emily he can feel each person as special, as "" touchy as a nettle "".
Mr. Jones is still in his twenties. He works as a teacher in Canterbury, and published a striking first collection two years ago. The present book, in its openness and originality, puts him on the front line o& the new English poetry. It is writing to startle anyone, with the
jerky detailed authenticity of your own home-movie. He can make the new blaze out of the old, like the moment when Grandad grows expansive in his armchair in Islington, and suddenly begins to tell of great seabirds-
that followed clippers in the
China seas
and never budged a wing, and
of the fogs
arou(nd Newfoundland, that a
sailor could
carve with a knife, or cork in
bottles... and finally.
he tried to give what wealth he'd
gained those hints of possibility
that goad you ng blood....
The American poet Robert Bly is also concerned with blood, but blood spilt, the blood on the hands of his own country. The Light Around the Body (Rapp and Whiting, 21s.) is a public protest. It is a named attack on the imperialism of Johnson, Rusk -and more surprisingly- John F. Kennedy. It is a lament for "" The Great Society "". What kind of irony is it when you see that these poems carry the American National Book Award 1968 ?
The Kitchen Poems (Cape Goliard, 13s. 6d.) of J. H. Prynne
acknowledge the impendinrg crisis, but explore it behind the scenes again, and are more probing and much more difficult. Mr. Prynne's "" kitchen "" is basically economics: the backroom where not only wars but all our individual jobs and hopes and fears are calculated, graphed and statistically defined. He shares the distrust of this generalizing process-affecting both our language and our thinkingwhich comes from the tradition of Pound, from the great Cantos against usury.
The English cendition is now so abstract that it soumds like an old record; the hiss and crackle suborns the music, so that the trte literal has very few names.
The search for the "" true literal"" (""The public is no more than the sign on the outside of the shopping bag ""), deserves putting in a current context, and an Introduction could have ihelped here. Briefly: Mr. Prynne (Cambridge Lecturer, specialist in Victorian poetry and black corduroy suits) is in close contact with the Black Mountain poets.
Working in what is a new field. the ""Kitohen Poems "" are still struggling with their own problems of abstract language, and a
deadened verse paragraph which occasionally flares into life: "" the splintered naming of wares creates targets for want like a glandular riot "". They ask for patience and attention, and hold out for the future.
Anselm Hollo has produced a marvellously cool translation of Selected Poems: Paavo Haavikko (Cape Goliard, 16s.). Haavikko is a Finn from Mr. Hollo's native Helsinki, the leading poet of the Modernists who brokle away from "" Germanic syntax and nationalistic idealism "" in the 1950s. In particular, the long poem "" The Bowmen "", with its mixture of imagism and troll-myth and radical politics, comes across into English as if it were Mr. Hollo's own, with a haunting manner that hides fire and steel. (An Introduction gives helpful background.)
Finally, if you want to fade into the background altogether, try the Penguin Classic Poems from the Sanskrit (4s. 6d. translated by John Brough. Love, for the classical Indian poets, was physical but ceremonious; and the great season was not spring but the time of the autumnal monsoons:

New poetry in Pinter
By David Wade
One of the remarkable things about Harold Pinter's Lantdscape. given its world premiere on radio last night, is that in it Mr. Pinter successfully combines the tried and familiar with the new. displaying in both a complete command of his powers.
Duff and Beth sit in the kitchen of a country house. Here they have been employed, he as chauffeur and general handyman. she as cook and housekeeper. They have the house to themselves; their employer, Sykes. is no longer around-perhaps he is dead. It is evenine. and as they sit. Duff recounts to Beth the prosaic events of the day before: how he walked to the pond and took shelter from the rain, then went to a pub where some nut complained about the beer. Carefully he avoids the past earlier than yesterdav. Beth never answers him. She is in a past far beyond yesterday-reliving a day spent with a man bv a desolate b=ach. Was this man Duff ? Probably, although her vision of him is strangely at odds with the coarse, rough-spoken man who now talks to her.
That man lying in the sand, whom she recalls so lovingly, seems to represent a hope of what her life might have been, a hope in which is mingled some part of another,
finer man-it may have been Sykes -a hope at all events blasted by experience. This experience is foreshadowed in what she recalls, for in that remembered day "" ... . he turned to look at me but I couldn't see his look. (Pause) I couldn't see whether he was looking at me. (Pause) Although he had turned. And appeared to be looking at me"". As the play proceeds Duff, drawn by his wife's silence, also moves into the past, remembering his own failure to live up to her dreams. his resentment at it and his one shameful outburst of violence against her.
In Duff we have. as it were. a traditional Pinter character, crude and inarticulate yet creating out of this his own telling imagery. He is played with absolute mastery by Eric Porter. Beth is utterly different and here Mr. Pinter is writing in another style. The phraseology has its familiar exactitude. but it has. besides a fresh and exceptionally limpid quality. From it emerges the portrait of a woman drawn with a tenderness that reveals in the author a new poetic, even romantic strain. Peggy Ashcroft, voice delicately vulgarized, missed not one inflection of this exquisite dialogue. Both she and Mr. Porter were admirably supported by Guy Vaesen's sensitive: production which bridged long silences with distant country noises or courageously just let them be silent",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS152137370/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=f15a1e0f

Imagists and Eskimos
PRIMITIVE SONG
By C. M. Bowra
(Weidenfeld 21s)
For all its A-pollonian Oxford elegance, this is a revolutionary book. To begin with, it is our first comprehensive Anthropology of poetry. Sir Maurice Bowra has studied the songs of the most primitive peoples now alive on the earth-the Bushmen. the Eskimos. the Pygmies, the tribes of South America and the Australian outback-and returned as near as possible to the roots of literature in human society. He discovers poetry emnerging from the ritual of the dance, through charms, prayers, and the sudden lyric outburst, into communal chants, stories, and the passionate explanations of Myth.
There is an extraordinary correspondence between primitive and modem poetic practice. The Eskimo hunter Orpingalik is recorded as saying: "" Man is moved just like the icefloe out in the current-thoughts wash over himn like a flood, his breath comes in gasps, his heart throbs. Poems are thoughts sung out with the breath when people are moved by great forces . . :' This is startlingly close to the ideas of Pound. William Carlos Williams and Charles Olson on how poetry works. They agree that poetry is powerful and communal experience sung out, to be heard.
You gull, up there.
steer down towards me, come to me.
Your wings are red
up there in the coolness.
You could call that an Imagist poem. But it is by an Eskimo.
THE THEATRE OF THE ABSURD by Martin Esslin (Pelican 8s 6d). A classic of campaigning modern criticism. Starting from the rapturous reception of Godot in San Quentin prison (1957), Mr. Esslin defines his own influential catchphrase in four long essays on Beckett. Adaamov. lonesco and Genet; then spreads into an informative and international catalogue of related playwrights (Pinter, Frisoh, Grass, &c.); and settles into a solid discussion of the tradition and significance of the Absurd. This edition adds material on the Pol,ish and Czech theatres, and a retrospective chapter. Richly partisan, it remains the best introduction to the post-war European Theatre open both to excitement and disagreement.
A PERFECT STRANGER by Edward Hyams (Panther, 5s) ""Adam left Eden because he suffered the disease no god has ever understood ... boredom with a beauty and a truth made for you but not by you."" This is, too, the predicament of Luther Emmettrich, urbane, good-looking; but feather-bedded. His quest for kicks drives him to violence, and murder, but even then he has to contrive his own fate. Mr. Hyams's novel is flush with penetrating social comment; idlehanded Luthers are all around us (at all social levels) and the Devil continues to find work for them. A MOTHER'S KISSES by Bruce Jay Friedman (Penguin 5s). Mr. Friedman has taken the traditional American Jewish Momma, doubled her horrors, freshened her make-up, sharpened her tongue and made her good as new. Joseph, daydreaming teenage innocent, is dispatched to a summer camp, rescued from a theft charges enrolled at a Mid-West agricultural college. Momma Meg arranges everything. Joseph is grumbling, passive, clumsily aware of his sexuality; Meg is frenzied, devoted. Mr. Friedman makes the most of this unequal battle, and sketches in, quickly and accurately, a host of minor supporters at the fray. Very, very funny: the dialogue a knock-out.
BEER IN THE SNOOKER CLUB by Waguih Ghali (Penguin 4s). The club is in Cairo, the beer iImitation Bass, concocted by Ram and Font, two young Egyptian Copts. Their tradition and schooling, and a period of studying in London (Ram's is ""p Perhaps the only copy of Tribune that comes into Egypt "") have left them outsiders, disenchanted with the Revolution's methods, but yearning for commitment.

VOICES: An Anthology of Poetrv and Pictutres
EDITED BY GEOFFREY SUMMERFIELD
(Penguin Educationz. Three volumes, 8s 6d each, teachers' htandbook 2s 6d)
Traditional school poetry anthologies are constructed to a pattern: there are plenty of ballads, a few limericks and comic pieces; anything up to a third is concerned with ships and the sea;
there is a hefty staple of Major Poets on the seasons, animals and people, counterbalanced by a few modernistic stanzas about pylons and arterial roads. The intention is honourable: to offer an historic tour of Eng. Lit., and to develop a child's awareness of his literary heritage.
The results in the classroom are less noble. The teacher is often bewildered by the difficulties of utilizing a selection which respects the poet rather than the child. He drowns with Sir Patrick Spens, perjures himself by playing along with the anthology's assumption that sea-faring is the only metaphor for adventure and escapism, justifies the Romantics by arguiing that, well, really, Autumn is mellow and fruitful, isn't it and in a froth of
enthusiasm points triumphantly to the contemporaneity of a poem which mentions traffic lights.
Geoffrey Summerfield, with neither hesitation nor repentance, has ignored the traditional pattern in this three-volume anthology of poetry and pictures intended for lower, mniddle and upper forms of secondary schools. His Voices are those of poets speaking in the classroom, introducing or extending the children's discussion or work. An immediate and common dialogue from classes who have looked at the books: ""Please, sir, this isn't poetry "". "" Why not ?"" ""Well-it's about people like us
And so it is. The poems look at people: in the first book directly and simply, then with more concern for reaction and context, and
in the third book, with an awareness of the shape of existernce. There are a large number of good, quite tricky, modern poems, a deal of traditional folk-verse, and some sharp translations from Czech, Japanese and AngloSaxon. There is very little of the Greats, but a confident display of those poets (Clare, Hardy, Thomas, Owen, Frost) who speak with respect and gentleness to young people.
The layout is firm and businesslike, something after the style of B.B.C. schools pamphlets; notes are restricted to the essentials of vocabulary; poets are not given dates. Physically, then, the anthology forces the child to make his own judgments and examine his own response, since all poems are
presented as equals. The numberrhyme which he has himself chanted, the hard humour of the gravestone epitaph, the unsophisticated account of the Black Country cock-fight-these are given equal prominence with final, disciplined comment from Sandburg, Lawrence, Hopkins.
Each book has about 30 pictures on the theme of the poems. Some are splendid (particularly the nineteenth-century photographs of industrial life) but there is a colour-mag modishness about some of the war illustrations. Again, layout, and juxtaposition leave verdict and extension to the child himself. And unillustrated anthologies have begun to look incomplete.
A group of sharp sixth-form
scientists started to look at Voices: within five minutes they were reading to each other some of the things they had found. A school anthology which has such an immediate appeal is doing its job properly: letting the poet speak. For the teacher who wishes to bring the poet's voice more fully into class work (and indeed the books could serve as a firm base for a whole English course) there are some modestly authoritative notes in a separate pamphlet.
A title in the first book is Depressed by a Book of Bad Poetry, I Walk toward an Unused Pasture and Invite the Insects to Join Me. Mr. Summerfield has given the pasture a purpose; his invitation to the little insects is fresh, exciting and irresistible.

"HOLMES, RICHARD","Poets: Campbell, Lowell, Herbert, Sexton, Barker",The Times,1968-Mar-02,"London, England","Poets: Campbell, Lowell, Herbert, Sexton, Barker
Roy Campbell fought for the Nationalists in Spain, railed against pink Utopians and birth-controllers, translated San Juan de la Cruz and not Catullus, preferred the couplet to vers libre, and was still excluded from the Faber Book of Modern Verse on bis death in 1957. In fact he was awkward.
His Selected Poetry (The Bodley Head, 30s.) shows to what purpose. It is clear that Campbell had two exceptional gifts. The range of a natural adventurer in all things (he wrote lyric, narrative. allegoric and polemical poetry. and translated from Latin, Spanish. French and Portuguese); and with this, an aboriginal directness of style, of feeling, of image. Autumn, that great English excuse for seasonal maudlin, becomes in a brief love poem:
I love to see when leaves depart, tze clear anatomy arrive,
Winter, the paragon of art,
that kills all forms of life and feeling save what is pure and will survive. Already now the clanging chains
of geese are harnessed to the
moon. . . -
He was caught in the red terror in Toledo 1936. when "" life. a fly upon a rum-glass rim, was subject to the vilest drunkard's whimn"". and he never forgave (or was forgiven by) "" MacSpaunday "". his composite scarecrow of MacNeice, Spender, Auden. and DayLewis
and all who farmed the carnage for
good pay
though from the bayonets they kept
far away,
from Koestler down to Earnest
Hemingway.
His Georgiad (1931) and Flowering Rifle (1936) are full of hate and historical bias. as indeed are the "" Dunciad "" and "" MacFlecknoe "", whose edge and energy they catoh continually. And since Pope, who has so celebrated the brisk unfashionable strength of the pentameter couplet:
With its ten fingers twirling thumbs
of rhyme
to seize and clamp the trailing
th'oughts that fray
and scatter like tobacco by the way, and in iambics fold them, neatly set, as nimble fingers scroll a cigarette for memory to case them in his
breast
and smoke at leisure, as it suits him
best.
Poetry, a meditative handrol1 for the sailors, cowmen, and soldiers he lived among.
And also for the contemplatives. Penguin Classics have re-issued Campbell's versions of Poems by
Roy Campbell: an awkward case.
St. John of the Cross (4s 6d). St John's ecstasy was experienced in an 8 by 8 stone cell in the sweltering summer of Toledo 1567, and Campbell has caught the terror and the passion of the place, the dark night of the soul. The short line can crab his manner, but again and again he achieves an extraordinary Psalmic balance of the explicitly erotic with the implicitly sublime. The breathless "" Upon a gloomy night "" is justly famous, and there are others as fine. Campbell worked with strange humility (for him), and rhymed ""translate "" with "" assassinate "".
His versions of Baudelairestiff, almost disapproving-suffer in comparison with the agonized empathy that Robert Lowell has since deployed upon them. Lowell's Baudelaire is now collected in a coffee-table gloater's edition, The Voyage (Faber 84s), with haunted full-page illustrations by Sidney Nolan in red and black and desperate blue. Lowell is much less reliable than has been made out, but he can make a brilliantly distorted mirro, of his original, up-dating the exotic ennui of the Second Empire to the skintight neuroses of the Pax Americana:
If poison, arson, sex, narcotics,
knives
have not yet ruined us and stitched
their quick.
loud patterns on the canvas of our
lives,
it is because our souls are still too
sick....
a superb traduction of the French.
The problems of politics and translation coincide in the eighth of the Penguin Modern European Poets: Selected Poems of Zhigniew Herbert (4s 6d). Herbert is a Pole who fought the Nazis underground, and sat out Stalinism grimly behind a desk. His poetry first saw light in 1956. and is here translated by Czeslaw Milosz and the Canadian Peter Dale Scott into clean open versions. Herbort uses Greek. Shakespearian, and homemade myths with a kind of coldwater wit, startling private judgments to matters of public and political fact. He is Fortinbras who soliloquizes over the dead idealist Hamlet. His world, in spite of human horror, is solid, reasonable: ""I have never observed a chair shift from one foot to the other.. . . I suspect that objects do this from pedagogical considerations, to reprove us constantly for our instability "". His cool is
classic, deliberately adopted. He remembers in the midst of public crisis
Thucydides says only
that he had seven ships it was winter
and he sailed quickly
A good collection to learn from, with signposts set at the beginning by A. Alvarez.
Penguin Modern Poets 11 (3s 6d) is dull by contrast, in spite of a cover of electric gold. D. M.

Peter Redgrove is getting graver and more opaque in his domestic illuminism, although his prose fantasias show mad glints. D. M. Thomas alone is outward bound: he writes pointed Science Fiction poems, inspired by Bradbury and Arthur C. Clarke, with a great sense of the grotesque and the sharp backlash of SF plots.
Oxford Paperbacks offer another threesome: Poems by Thomas Kinsella Douglas Livingstone and Anne Sexton (7s 6d). This is a distinguished group of colonials (from Dublin, Kuala Lumpur, and Massachusetts respectively) in slightly thin selection. Mr. Kinsella has a delicate dancing stanza, and Mr. Livingstone a way in animal affairs. But Anne Sexton stands out: a passionate. troubled. American homemaker, anxious to be honest, to discover her own feelings in others: the Victorian grandmother of ""Some Foreign Letters "", or the "" Unknown Girl in the Maternity Ward "". She has the bitter sparkled fear of her close friend Sylvia Plath: they discussed death and drank Boston martinis together. Her style is free, gathering movement across spacious uneasy living-rooms: I hear as in a dream
the conversation of the old wives speaking of womanhood.
I remember I heard nothing myself. I vas alone. I waited like a target.
From George Barker comes The Golden Chains (Faber 18s.), 104 small lyrics each of two quatrains, by an old master of
' figure-skating in the stanza "". The sexual disillusion of the original ""True Confession"" (1947), and the somewhat paunchy rhetoric of later work. are here both sweetened and disciplined. Mr. Barker summons odd places of vision-Stour River, Tivoli. Victoria Terminus, the Land of Pelops-dreaming, and adjusting memories. Reading through gives that distracted melancholy pleasure of throwing stone after stone into the sea.

CONCRETE POETRY: An International Anthology.
EDITED BY STEPHEN BANN (Alan Ross 36s).
Concrete poetry overlaps with the fields of painting and music, just as painting and music today overlap with poetry and with each other. Phonetic poems, chants, mantras, are related to music: poems where traditional literary syntax is replaced by spacesingle words in spatial relations on the page which can be taken in at a glance-are close to painting. In concrete poetry words are treated as signs, like forms in concrete painting, and this makes the poet as free to relate them as a concrete artist is to relate forms. In one of his essays on modern poetry Dom Sylvester Houedard puts this very clearly: "" The word is no longer the prison of some esoteric meaning and no longer shocked by its juxtapositions.""
This cool state of the word has cxisted since the early days of modern art when the autonomy of each field of art began to be broken down, especially by groups like the Dadaists. Moholy-Nagy in his ' Vision in Motion"" treated music, writing and visual art together. He discerned a "" lightening of material"" (meaning grammar
and syntax) in poetry exactly equivalent to the lightening of material in painting and sculpture.
The presen,t anthology, which is the first widely available contains some marvellous poems. But It is about concrete poetry in a fairly strict sense. Stephen Bann, by his choice not oiily of poets but also of work by the poets seleoted, has cast the book very much in the mould of Gomringer and the Brazilian poets. These precise typographical "" constellations "" (Gomringer's title), geometrical blocks of wordsounds austerely evolving and mutating words; are they not one aspect only of concrete poetry ? The most formal aspect perhaps, stylistically coherent, but tending to hide the possibilities of language revealed in other works by several of these poets, as well as by other poets.
The book's production helps create this impression. It is a neat square format and an elegant printing job by the Shenval Press. But you have to consider the effect on poems which make their own space, of all being given the uniform space of a book. It must reduce the spontaneity of the packets and cards, posters, cut-ups and long strip books (as well as objects in which words are inseparable from physical sensations and sequences of actual movements) in which poets have put out their work recently.

We do no service to the arts if we leave them at the top of their mountain to consider only the highest raptures and most tortured anguishes of human experience. It seems actually to do them good to bring them down every now and again to romp in the valley.
The willingness of The Barrow Poets (Heather Black, Cicely Solith, William Bealby-Wright and Gerard Benson. with Susan Baker. their violinist, and Jim Parker. who plays the oboe and the cor anglais) to do this is one reason for their success as entertainers in pubs, on gramopbone records and last night in a well-filled Queen Elizabeth Hall.
Their poetry ranged from Dunbar to clerihews; it contained serious, moving works, parodies and ridiculous tricks with words. Their music embraced Morley, Campion, Dowvland, Bartok and, among other jests. Mr. Parker's Fantasia on a Theme by Balfe; Mr. Parker's jokes are, incidentally, 4uite good ones.
The other reason for the pleasure they give is that they choose poetry which can without inflation or distortion be projected to an audience.

Chopin poetry

By Mosco Camner
The chief interest of last night's Promenade concert at the Albert Hall centred in the young Russian pianist, Victoria Postnikova, whc won the first prize in the Chopin Competition at Warsaw in 1965 and the second prize at last year's Leeds International Piano Competition. With such credentials in her pocket Miss Postnikova could bL sure of the enthusiastic reception which she received from the packed audience.
The concerto she chose for incr Prom debut was Chopin's in E minor, and. as her performance proved to the hilt, it was a very happy choice. For one of her age it was astonishing how completely she was inside the music, basing her interpretation on the poetic content of the concerto-so much so that its technical aspect seemed almost incidental.
True, there was a measure of emotional reserve in her playing of the appassionato phrases in the first two movements-even a certain detachment. But this seemed to matter little. For she moulded her lyrical lines with such inborn musicianship, brought to them such perfectlv controlled tone and minutely graded dynamics that one sat completely enthralled.
Needless to say, her technical command is faultless, but it was more in the feathery lightness with which she negotiated subtle florid ornaments that one admired her than in the glittery runs and double-thirds a la Hummel. And though the finale was carried off with great rhythmic verve, it lacked sufficient tonal sparkle. After the intenral Miss Postnikova regaled us with a superlative performance of three of Rachmaninov's Preludes. Op. 23.
In attendance was the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under Sir Adrian Boult, who opened the proceedings with Mendelssohn's mildly inspired overture The Fair Melusina, and concluded them with Brahms's Second Symphony of which the conductor gave a deeply sympathetic account allowing the music spaciousness and breath.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS102067457/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=d82e48c4

By
STANLEY SADIE
Since Weber was a great composer and Planchd a poor librettist, any revival of Oberon must take the music as its starting point. Cambridge University Opera Group's production, which had the first of three performances tonight, includes everything that Weber wrote except one rather inferior aria. and trims Planche's text to the barest minimum and sometimes a little beyond it, for the omission of certain scenes and the shortening of others makes some of the motivation and action even obscurer than they were to start with.
Yet this, I am sure, is basically the right way to do it. The music showed up marvellously. It is so wide in range: heroic in Huon-s "" From Boyhood
trained "" and Rezia's "" Ocean, Thou Mighty Monster "", deeply pathetic in his prayer and her cavatina; brilliantly illustrative in the stormn scene, utterly enchanting in the mermaid's song; full of happy melody in the numbers for the secondary characters and in the choruses; and the wbole beautifully scored with a gossamer touch in the fairy music, with bright colours in the exotic scenes. It has inspired composers as unlike as Wagner and Sullivan.
And as conducted by Mr. David Atherton, with an orchestra of Cambridge students past and present (plus a little stiffening), its appeal was irresistible. The overture clearly had been rethought, and Mr. Atherton's free but firmly controlled rhythms made real. imaginative musical sense. The same
feeling for the poetic qualities of the score and of its rhythmic qualities too, informed his direction the whole evening.
Mr. Ande Anderson's production had some weak moments-especially in the scenes in Baghdad and Tunis-but he and the designer, Mr. Hugh Durrant, made the best of the theatre's facilities and gave us a certain amount of magical illusions in the transformation scenes, reinforcing it with gongs and the modern magic of electronic sound.
Among the cast. Miss Margaret Kingsley sang Rezia with strong line but hard tone; Mr. Jon Weaving, appearing at short notice and evidently hampered by a cold, made a creditable attempt at Huon. Miss Anne Howells was an accomplished Fagima, and Mr. Neil Jenkins and Miss Janet Hughes were persuasive as the fairies.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS68250697/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=677df6a7
Null,Poets American and English,The Times,1966-Aug-18,"London, England","Poets American
and English
Louis Simpson's Selected Poems introduces to English readers an excellent American poet-and one in whose work many of the recent developments in American poetry are mirrored. The poems in this book that date from the first 10 years after the war are elegant, witty, reserved-even in the poems about the war the worst experiences are held some distance away in the memory, rather as in Mr. Simpson's description of the Aegean:
Though still the ohve glows Like silver, and the rose
Is glittering and fresh, as in their day, No witnesses remain
Of battles on the plain
And the bright oar and the oar spray.
But in a poem published three years ago Mr. Simpson said of American poetry: Whatever it is, it must have A stomach that can digest
Rubber, coal, uranium, moons, poems.
In his latest work the digestion is going well, and there are some poems of real finesse and force about America after Walt Whitman: the clash between high dreams and happiness-and their inextriable entanglement; the banks and the cheap housing u'nder the great cloud-wagons moving overhead on the Pacific shore, and the ""murmur of serious life"" still going on among it all.
Randall Jarrell, who died in a car accident last year, was the author of one of the wittiest of campus novels. Pictures fronm an Institution; but his last book of poems, Thle Lost World, consists mainly of rather rambling dramatic monologues. Those about his childhood are probably the least satisfying, but the sharp-eyed, yet gentle, studies of marriages have the ring of justice being done and truth being said. A quite different kind of poet is Mr. Robert Creeley, almlost held as a saint now on the more progressive campuses: in his very short poems there is no meditation, just an attempt to catch, in the breathing of a few syllables, some passing, delicate feeling:
My lady fair with soft
arms, what
can I say to
you-words, words as if all
worlds were there.
The best poems in his Poems 1950-1965 are inimitable, but many seem just to slip off the tongue and vanish.
To turn to the new volumes of English poetry, Mr. Charles Tomlinson also writes in short lines dropping down the page in a tentative, graceful way-moreover, his last poem is dedicated to "" Robert and Bobbie Creeley "", and his title is American Scenes. But he uses the manner to describe things seen rather than things feltfrom a desert landscape to a half-pear. Sometimes the result is too bare of human interest, sometimes there is a rather weak philosophical twist in the conclusion, but in those poems where feeling builds up with the strokes of the picture-particularly in some poems of snow-scenes-the effect is very fine.
Seamus Heaney's Death of a Naturalist is a first volume by a young Irish poet. Descriptions are the best thing in his work so far, too, but he does them in a way quite other than Mr. Tomlinson's: his forms and rhythms are conventional, but full of apt and flashing similes: frogs like "" mud grenades"", a river ""oil-skinned, wearing A transfer of gables and sky"" a horse-ploughman's shoulders ""globed like a full sail "", a dead turkey ""in immodest underwear frills of feather . . . A skin bag plumped with inky putty "".
Mr. R. S. Thomas's Pieta is another group of poems on his dominant theme, the bleakness of both nature and the human spirit in the Welsh hills, and his own unreciprocated love for them. Mr. George Barker, on the other hand, has some poems in new and unfamiliar moods in his Dreams of a Sunmmer Night: ""The Sisteron"" is about an unexpected happiness and peace of spirit, brought to him by ""eyes that are kinder far than mine"". The joky casualness that mars some of the other poems in the book is quite kept out of this one. Miss Elizabeth Jennings has produced her best collection for some time in The Mind Has Mountains, with its wise and tender studies of mentalhome patients-poems as thoughtful about the psychiatrists as they are understanding about the suicides, with a measured tone that is sometimes very moving. Most of Miss Karen Gershon's poems are about even greater horror, Jewish suffering in the war, and her own complex emotions about the dead as one who escaped. Her Selected Poems is an impressive book both for the feeling and for the restmirat with which it handles its themes.
Finally, a book to take its readers far away-and yet leave them feeling strangely at home: Mr. Ulli Beier's anthology, African Poetry, where a wealth of imagination brings out the life of men and women as diverse as the bushman who prays to the moon "" Take my face and give me yours "", the Ethiopian girl who thinks of her worthless lover as "" a measure of water thrown on the hearth "": and the covetous Yoruba hunter who sings to the antelope

PUTNEY TO PARNASSUS

Oliver Edwards
How much we owe to chance benefactors, even more to those who forever remain unknown. I can stil remember the thrill of making my way through my school's book of poetry and suddenly finding among the Casabiancas, and the Excelsiors, Heart of Oak, and The Private of the Buffs, some verses including: -
Pale, beyond porch and portal,
Crowned with calm leaves, she stands Who gathers all things mortal
With cold immortal hands; Her langtuid lips are sweeter
Than love's who fears to greet her To men that mix and meet her
From many times and lands.
As I was to find out later, the whole of Swinburne's "" Garden of Proserpine "" was not given, just three or four stanzas. (When I did unearth the poern in full I at once got it off by heart.) But I have often wondered who it was, which master living or dead, who had decided that among all the stoicism, and the patriotism, and the heroism, that could profitably be pumped into small boys, a little beauty would do no harm.
This is the centenary year of Poems and Ballads, but the memory has not come back to me because of that. It is because 1 have been reading the new edition of Sir Ifor Evans's English Poetry in the Later Nineteenth Century. It is a remarkably comprehensive conspectus of a rich period. He includes Woolner and Allingham, Massey and David Gray, in between the chapters devoted to Rossetti and Meredith, Hardy, Bridges, Kipling, and Housman. (There are many others; this is not a catalogue.)
The pages that held me most were the 42 on Swinburne. For one thing they are as up to date and as balInced a view of Swinburne as one could hope for. Sir Ifor retires from the Provostship of University College London this year. He has been such an outstanding administrator, and collector of unknown benefactors, that one has been inclined to look forward to his release so that he could return to his studies. This new edition of his 1933 work shows that he has never abandoned them. Among all his occupations he has managed to keep up with wbat has been written since and significantly added to his subject. His notes and brief bibliographies show his critical eye has not slept.
This is particularly valuable in the case of Swinburne. During the greater part of his life and for 50 years after his death, rumour and suspicion clung to the name of Swinburne. Then in 1959 Professor Lang began publication of his definitive edition of Swinburne's Letters. He included Gosse's unpublished memoir on Swinburne. It is true, as Sir Ifor Evans says, that all Gosse revealed
had been known. The memoir could not clear Swinburne's name. It did replace hints by facts, conjecture by certainty, on all matters except one.
Professor Lang also restored Swinburne to his proper place among the great English poets. And Sir Ifor indirectly, without ever going out of his way to make the point. removes much of the odium that the Romantics attached to Watts-Dunton. He may not have been a likable man but he was a well-meaning and, where Swinburne was concerned, a devoted one. He saved Swinburne from an early end: he thus enabled the world to have some works of the poet only just below the highest, and he may even be said to have begun the eighty year process of restotring his fame.
If Swinburne had died in 1879 or 1880 we should also have been deprived of some of his best prose. I admit that his excessive enthusiasm for his favourites can become tiring, rather like being out too long in a high wind. He was nevertheless a sensitive and original critic. Whether he was writing on Hugo or Shakespeare, Whitman or Dickens, WiLkie Collins or Charles Reade. he had almost always something interesting to say.
More important, had Swinburne not been taken to live at No. 2, The Pinn, we should never have had his trilogy of Mary Queen of Scots complete. If Birnam Wood came to Dunsinane as the portent of disaster, nothing but good came out of Fotheringay at Putney. Earle Welby thought that Swinburne over-valued Mary Stuart, and placed it below Chastelard and Bothwell. At the same time Welby pointed out that it was as a writer of tragedy Swinburne went on developing to the end of his life. And without Mary Stuart the massive triptych would have remained incomplete. We should not have had the wonderfully dramatic da capo-one of the haunting moments in tragedy-of Chastelard's song.
Sir Ifor writes on the Mary Queen of Scots trilogy at length. His temperate appreciation set me reading the- plays again. It is true to say ""again"" of Chastelard and Mary Stuart but I cannot say with honest certainty I have read every line of Bothwell before. (I shall never do so again.) It is a monstrosity as a play. Sir Ifor calls it gargantuan and quotes an early reviewer who said it "" had about as many lines as Hamlet supplemented by Paradise Lost "". The genius of Shakespeare would have ruthlesslv truncated this fantastic centre-piece. Yet not the least of the many things I owe to Sir Ifor is that he persuaded me to stay to the end.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS236153618/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=51f39767

Poetry that
cries out for music
From Our Special Correspondent
ALDEBURGH, JUNE 17
This morning's concert took the form of a memorial tribute to Dame Edith Sitwell, divided between readings of poems and music which either the poetry or the poetess herself had inspired, some of it previously unperformed. It was a programme which rightly belonged to the Parish Church rather than the Jubilee Hall: every poem cried out, like the grass-blade in ""How Many Heavens . . ."" that "" God is everything ! "", though Mr. William Plomer himself in his clear and mellifluous reading seemed rather too ifluenced by a pulpit style of delivery. It was a programme which also brought home just wthy so many of Dame Edith's poems, however complete in themselves, yet cry out for music: the extraordinary richness of her imagery is something that few composers will ever be able to resist.
The most ambitious of the unfamiliar works was Humphrey Searle's "" The Canticle of the Rose"" for solo voices and choir. This was of particular interest for the way in which, while solo voices as it were tell the story, the rest of the choir provide an atmospheric background as complete and evocative as any instrumental accompaniment. There was a magical passage for female voices inspired by the imagery of a "" river flowing ""; there was a daring excursion into tum-tumming hum-drum worldliness for male voices. The other new music was for the organ alone. Malcolm Williamson's two epitaphs for Edith Sitwell, though slight, made a perfect prelude and postlude for a programme such as this, with their striking contrasts of high, sustained celestial calm and stabbing lower sonorities. Lennox Berkeley's equaUy succinct "" Aubade "" brought urbaner, sometimes even smiling, contrast in a style at first neo-Bachian, but the argument was ultimately dissolved rather than resolved.
Of the familiar music in *the programme, Britten's own third Canticle, "" Still Falls the Rain "", for tenor, horn, and piano struck home most forcibly with the economical directness of its response to poetic imagery. In Michael Tippett's ""The Weeping Babe "" for soprano and choir compassion releases a flow of counterpoint, beautiful, but less emotionally concentrated. There was also Malcolm Williamson's unassumingly simple "" A Young Girl "" for choir. Mr. Benjamin Britten, Mr. Peter Pears, Miss April Cantelo, Mr. Neil Sanders. Mr. Simon Preston, and the Purcell Singers under Mr. George Malcolm were the sensitive artists.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS117664466/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=c1ff9629

precision
Our watches told us that Anton Webern's last three works, which were played in succession during last night's B.B.C. concert at the Festival Hall, had lasted a little over half an hour. Instinct contradicted fact: we seemed to have lived through as intense, as far-reaching an experience as most composers offer in an entire evening's music.
The enigma is easily explained. Webern's music is packed so tight as to make a rushhour Tube seem empty by comparison. But not often is its emotional conten.t as manifes, indeed as striking, as it %%s under Mr. Pierre Boules. The B.B.C. Symphony Orchestra seemed so utterly at ease over what notes to play, and just when and how to play them, that they could concentrate on the notes' whys and the wherefores. So the music made real sense-eacih of the variations of Op. 30 was sharply characterized, and the whole had both logic and feeling.
No less assured was the singing in the two cantatas. The B.B.C. Chorus negotiated their awkward leaps as confidently as if they were singing Bach. Mr. Barry McDaniel brought tonal warmth and truly expressive line (the intervening rests notwithstanding) to his two movements in Op. 31. and Miss Halina Lukomska, though at first hard in tone, sang wiLh considerable beauty as well as accuracy, and in "" Freundselig ist das Wort ""-the heart of the second cantata,-as both fleet of voice where necessary and moving in expression.
Mr. Boulez also gave us a good deal to think about in the other music he conducted. Stravinsky's Rite of Spring can never have been more clearly played; some might say, never more clinically-certainly it lacked a truly Dionysiac touch. But it was a joy to be able to hear so much of the score. Inner detail which generally is obscured by carelessly placed emphases was in evidence, so finely adjusted was the balance, so sharp the articulation. The price was paid in terms of sheer physical excitements it was, if there be such a thing. a slightly restrained orgy.
In Debussy's Nocturnes, too. Mr. Boulez offered a reading to please the mnind but not to satisfy the emotions. It was a delight to hear a performance of such lucidity. such rhythmic verve, and one which made us so aware of the poetry of precision. But the warm, satiated textures and sensuous atmospheres we remernber cannot be mere illusion; Debussy is not, surely, as cool a comnoser as Mr. Boulez would have us think.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS101411500/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=253aa858

Revived Ballet Keeps Poetry
and Fun
Royal Opera House: Cinderella
It seems incredible, watching the Royal Ballet's Cinderella, which was revived in a revised production at Covent Garden last night, that this was Frederick Ashton's first attempt at creating an evening-long ballet. Of course there have been manv changes of detail s;nce its premiere exactly 17 years ago. and this revision introduces several mnore, most notably an enchanting new solo for the Fairy Godmother, which now at last perfectly sets the mood for 4the Dances of the Seasons.
Yet basically the virtues of the work remain unchanged: the same balance of poetry and fun, the same blend of the tuaditional classic ballet and of the equally traditional English pantomime. For once (and this is Ashton's great achievement) these apparent opposites sit happily side by side, and even imperceptibly merge to form an entertainnment that is gentle and wise as well as amusing. It is also a perfect embodiment of the wishes of the composer who wanted his score to be "" as danceable as possible "".
Prokofiev's music, sweet and fluent, with a curiously affecting sad undertone in the final solemn wedding raptures, was handsomely played last night by the Covent Garden Orchestra under Mr. Sergiu Comissiona's direction. The new settings by Mr. Henry Barden are strangely Frenchified but effective. adequately pretty in the transformations and rightly fanciful in the ballroom scene. Not all of Mr. David Walker's dresses are an improvement on the early designs they replace, but one must be grateful that, with their help, the fairy tale element now works better than ever before.
It was a sentimental, and therefore in this context appropriate, touch to have ,three of the original principals playing once again the roles they created 17 years ago. Ashton himself and Mr. Robert Hlelpmann clown to the top of their bent as the Ugly Sisters, and Mr. Alexander Grant's Jester is as amusing as ever if no longer so nimble. Moreover, Miss Margot Fontevn. who was prevented only by acciden't from being the first Cinderella, proved herself once - more still the best. with an irrepressible,
just slightly naughty sense of humour to season her serenity, her sparkle, and her radiance.
XIMr. David Blair made an impetuously handsome Prince, and Miss Annette Page a Fairy Godmother of irresistible charm. Mr. Keith Martin's Dancing Master is an original and apt characterization, and Miss Merle Park's brilliance as the Autumn fairy really deserves a whole notice fo itself.

"" Conversation Piece with Lord Hervey "", by Hogarth.
By Edward Lucie-Smith
The exhibition of English pictures of the period 1730-1830. now at Agnews in aid of Enterprise Neptune, is entirely drawn from the collections in houses which belong to the National Trust. The show serves as a kind of confirmation, if not canonization, of a change in taste which has been taking place for some time now. We have more respect for English painting, and we look at it in a new way.
This change began in the broad sense with Professor Pevsner's memorable series of Reith lectures on the "" Englishness of English Art "". In a narrower sense it gathered impetus from the exhibition of the work of George Stubbs which was held some years ago at the Whitechapel Gallery. We can see the results of the change in the astonishing prices which have recently been paid at auction for English pictures of high quality. William Scott costs almost as much as CanaLetto, and Brooking more than van de Velde. And it must be said that, though American collectors, and Mr. Paul Mellon in particular, have been pioneers in this field of collecting, the renewal of interest in English eighteenth-century art is not simply a revival of the old Duveen taste for fulllength portraits of pretty children and glamorously aristocratic ladies. What hold our interest today are the conversation pieces, the landscapes, the pictures of ships and shipping-all those things. in fact, which bring us closest to the real England of the eighteenth century, to the country and the people as they actually existed.
But though the change has taken place, it has not yet been supplied with a rationale. Post hoc justifications are of course suspect, and never more so than when they concern the movement of fashion in the visual arts. Yet it seems to me that there is now a real case for the critical reexamination and reevaluation of the English painting of the eighteenth century. We have never looked at it in its proper context, and this is what has led to its being neglected for so long. What I shall sav here is only a sketch-the details need filling in, and no doubt some of my generalizations will turn out to be risky ones. But I hope, at least, to supply the framework for a new discussion of the subject.
Air of the Provincial
Let me begin. then, by acknowledging that the English art of the period is usually thought of as occupying a marginal place on the European scene. Compared with French or Italian (and particularly Venetian) painting, it appears provincial and unsophisticated. English painters, we are told, had very little in the way of a native tradition behind them -in the seventeenth century, almost all the notable artists in England had been foreigners-and they were much less free than painters on the Continent to create as they pleased. Patrons had a clear idea of what they required, and what they required was the prosaic depiction of themselves, their families, their houses and their domestic animals.
This summary of the condition of English painting is no more than a halftruth. To understand why this is so, we must consider the position which was held by England and Englishmen in the politics and thought of the eighteenth century as a whole. One of the basic facts about the condition of England at the time is that it is almost the only country which was not, potentially at any rate, a breeding ground for revolution. Englishmen were content with the main
outlines of the social and political system of their country, and the advanced political theorists of the Continent (and in particular the philosophers of the Enlightenment) held up English institutions as a model to the rest of the world. English political thinkers, such as Locke, had in any case exercised an immense influence over the new doctrines which were being preached in Europe.
English painting reflects this situation in a curious way. It is an art of acceptance, not an art of escape. The Rococo fantasy wbich we now so much admire in a painter like Watteau represents a retreat from reality which is in complete contrast to what we find in an Englishman like Hogarth. The Hogarth conversation piece from Ickworth. which is now on show at Agnews, provides a good example of this. It is at least as fluently and elegantly painted as any Watteau which I can think of. Especially marvellous is the free and fluid brusbwork with which the artist has created the fruit on the table, and the basket of fruit on the ground. But Hogarth is not creating a dream world. an ideal society. lie is content to show us what is.
Influence of Stage
Of course, the picture is not completely without artifice. The grouping derives from what Hogarth saw on the stage. Everything is arranged to be more typical, more telling, more concentrated than "" real life "" would be. Little anecdotal touches are brought in to catch the spectator's interest-a good example can be found on the left of the picture. where the clergyman with a telescope clapped to his eye is just about to be tipped off the chair he is standing on. The picture is not, perhaps, as miraculously resolved and unified as a mature fete galante by Watteau. But Hogarth is. in a sense, undertaking a more difficult task. He is not providing a substitute; he is trying to show us the genuine thing, to explain how these particular people conducted themselves, and what their relationships were to each other. The picture has a concentration of meaning in it which is absent from contemporary conversation pieces painted in France or Italy. It is a great deal more intense than any picture by Longhi. for example.
The growing economic power of England during the eighteenth century attracted many painters from abroadin particular. many of the most distinguished Venetian painters were err-
ployed by Blritish patrons, not only Canaletto, but decorators such as Pelligrini and Arnigoni. It says something for the integrity of English painting that the influences which these painters brought with them were painlessly absorbed. It is true that a certain snobbery often led the rich Whig magnates of England (the principal source of patronage) to prefer foreigners to nativeborn artists, with the result that a pair,ter of imaginative landscapes like Richard Wilson tended to have a hard time of it. Towards the end of the century, too. the growing obsession with the idea of History Painting led to an impatience with the conditions imposed by English patrons. Artists like Reynolds and Romney undoubtedly felt that their talents had not been employed to best effect. sirnply because of the conditions in which they found themselves.
On the other hand, those specimens of History Painting which we have from the brushes of these and other artists do not encourage us to feel that we have suffered any great loss. The cult of History Painting was, in part at least, an expression of the revolt against the inferior social status of the artist which was taking place all over Europe. The theoretical issue was a cover for the more practical and pressing one.
Matchless Masterpieces
Meanwhile, in the second half of the eighteenth century, English painters were producing masterpieces which cannot be matched elsewhere. I am thinking, in particular, of the two country scenes by Stubbs, which are also included in the exhibition at Agnews. These show harvesting and haymaking. They are a strange and beautiful combination of the utterly natural and the mathematically precise. The intervals between the various figures are as calculated as they would be in a great mythological composition by Poussin. Yet the other comparison which we think of is with some of Peter Breughel the Elder's pictures of seasonal occupations. Stubbs has the same reverence for the natural. seasonal rhythm which Breughel displays, and he sharec Breughel's ability to recreate reality and to make the spectator experience it at iis highest power. What we find in Stubbss best work is the poetry of fact. It is this poetrv which touches us again and again when we look at English eighteenth-centuLry painting.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS84109687/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=49730291
Null,Poems for the Good-Hearted,The Times,1965-Nov-04,"London, England","Poems for the Good-Hearted
A great deal of recent American poetry has gone back to the job of heartening the good-hearted. l wo of the many impressive volumes of American poetry lately published here show, respectively, a master and an accomplished pupil at the job. The master is the late William Carlos Williams, whose Collected Later Poems contains all his poetry written in the 1940s. In those grim years Williams wrote hundreds of slangy, slightly hectoring reminders of human decency and pleasure, as when he speaks of the refreshment to be had from
the humility of the snow that silvers everything and is
trampled anid lined with use-yet falls again.
Starlings chattering at the sun with hiorny lips "", the ' heavenly grossness"" of Ford Madox Ford licking his lips after a Provenqal meal, spirited girls and whiskydrinking old ladies-these and the subjects of all his other casual-seeming sketches illuminate a continuous concern for simple human brotherhood and happiness.
The pupil in the field is Miss Denise Lcvertov, an Essex girl who went to America after the war and now manages to be both a characteristic and a very individual ligure on the American poetic scene. The earlier poems in her book Tlle Jacob's Ladder are most like Williams's. The newer ones have the same ambition to enter people's lives lightly and unobtrusively, "" stirred into paper coffee cups, eaten with petals on rye in the sun "", but their glimpses of human ease and pleasure are more subtle, less jerky and joky. like her poem about an old man walking in the rain, contentedly drifting this way and that under the pull of his two dogs conflicting desires.
Theodore Roethke, who died in 1963, had a very high reputation in America, but his posthumous collection The Far Field is rather disappointing: in too many of the poems, eloquent though they are, the bardic or the courtly manner seems at odds with the violent. spontaneous impulses they are often about. The two most important volumes of American PoetrY of late are books that deal with violence in a different way. One is Ariel, by Sylvia Plath, who also died in 1963, when she was living in London. Her poems at their best combine an exact and powerful delineation of cruel or self-destructive emotion, with a brave wit or a determined hanging-on to happiness. They are noble poems. Mr. Robert Lowell's For the Uitionz Dead marks him out clearly as one of the most gifted poets writing in the English language today. It is his most
varied book yet, and its dazzlingly sharp and subtle evocations of nostalgia, hatred, grief, subdued pleasure-all these emotions often intricately worked into a single brief lyric or monologue-make the reading of it a profound participation in the modern life of the human soul-and the human body.
Recent English poetry seems rather slight by comparison. Mr. Frederick Grubb makes a good case for it in his first book of criticism, A Visionz of Reality, though he has also got objections to register in his readably cantankerous way. Of new books of verse by English poets. Mr. George MacBeth's A Doomsday Book shows the most original invention and care for craft at the same time-it instructs the reader how to play games as doom descends, and if the games seem sometimes facetious and the doom theatrical, there are a few unique and thrilling poems to which neither of those objections can be made. Mr. John Wain's rhetorical meditation on the world today, W'ildtrack, is too loosely written to hold much interest. while Mr. D. J. Enright, in Thte Old Adam, deftly satirizes the feebly liberal mind, but in a way he has done before.
Two volumes of collected poems should, however, be remarked on: that of Bernard Spencer, yet a third poet to die untimely in 1963. whose book is full of the colour and sadness of the world; and that of Mr. Robert Graves. who has unfortunately omitted some of his best early poems and included too many of a very recent. rather monotonous sequence. His previous Collected Poems, second-hand, would be a better buy.

Purity and Thinness in Concrete Poetry
By Edward Lucie-Smith
The fascination with the idea of the total aesthetic experience-an experience which fuses the ideas and sensations offered by two or more of the arts-is beginning to acquire a g6eat significance for modern writers and painters and even (I suspect) for musicians. A symptom is provided by the very wellmounted little exhibition called "" Between Poetry and Painting"". which is now on view at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, in Dover Street. The scope is, perhaps, narrower than the title suggests. Though the exhibition casts a backward glance at such pioneers as Kurt Schwitters and Guillaume Apollinaire, it is, in fact, a celebration of the new "" concrete poetry "" movement.
Concrete poetry is difficult to describe, but easy to recognize. The aim is to give words a new dynamism for the eve ----to make the poem a kind of emblem or ikon of what is being said. This has some immediately striiking results. If we choose to regard the products of the movement as belonging to literature. then it is the internationalism which strikes us. The exhibitors at the I.C.A. are French, German, Czech, and Austrian, as well as English and Scottish. The techniques they have in common seem to provide them with a kind of Esperanto. Words one doesn't in fact know signal their meaning thanks to the design in which they are set.
But it is by no means certain that concrete poetry belongs more to literature than it does to the visual arts (one practitioner says frankly that "" a more accurate term for this sort of work has still to be invented ""). My own inclination is to see concrete poetry as somewhat closer to painting than it is to writing. Yet perhaps this preference is an irrational one, and counts as a comment on the very different atmospheres which now seem to surround poetry and painting in England. The show has none of that characteristic defensiveness which one associates with literary experiment. Nor does it have that excessive regard for the vagaries of the writer's own personality. How can one be satisfactorily 'confessional "" when one is also being ""concrete "" ?
Distinguished Ancestry
All the same, whether or not it inclines more to art than to literature, let me try to place the movement among the competing styles of modern painting. Its ancestry is, of course, very distinguished. It includes the Italian Futurists and Dada. In the guise that it now presents itself, however, concrete poetry seems to be the meeting ground of a number of absolutely contemporary ideas. It is, for example, a branch of abstract painting of the severe and geometrical sort. But the image creeps in at the back door, through the word which forms the unit of pattern. And often the meaning the image conveys is basically rather sentimental. If one examines the work of Ian Hamilton Finlay (the most highly regarded British practitioner) one is surprised to find that what he so often hints at is the refined and rather bloodless pastoralism of the Georgians -sbut up inside the severe patterns he makes. a lyric from The Week End Book is mewing to be let out. But, to do Nir. Hamilton Finlay justicc. he has another line of experiment which seems to me more fruitful. In his more recent wvork. he introduces the idea of sequences in time-a booklet wvhose pages you turn so that you encounter certain words in isolation, following each other in staccato rhythm. What one sees
here is something like -he revolt against the completely static image which one finds in "" Op "" Art.
Another topic which fascinates the concrete poets, as indeed it does many rnodern painters, is the relationship to be found between the word and the actual thing it stands for. It was an interest in this problem which seems to have inspired Apollinaire to create the ""Calligrammes ""-still the most beautiful and lyrical things of their kind. But this, in turn, inspires me to a brief digression-one cannot, I think. discuss the topic of concrete poetrv without remarking that, even if it sometimes seems sentimental, it also has a genuinely Iyrical strain. There is a purity and innocence about some of these typographical diagrams which can make the processes of conventional literature seem verv laboured. Why bother to pile image on image when a diagram can give you the thing itself-the very object you wanted to represent 2
Act of Redemption
But sometimes-ancl here I return to my main theme-concrete poetry is genuinely abstract. Letters become the basis for experiments in forn-a ready made vocabulary of shapes from which interesting patterns and rhythms can be built up. but whose * ready made"" quality provides the artist with a kind of necessary recalcitrance, a resistance to what he wants to do. The workl of poets and typographical designers here finds a point of contact with what is being done by one or two of the most highlv regarded American painters, notably Jasper Johns. Some of John's most beautiful paintings are based upon sequences of numbers or of letters. These numbers and letters are, it is true, there so that John can ""redeem"" them with his beautiful brushwork. and in the severe typographical patterns favoured by some of the exhibitors at the I.C.A. one feeLs, perhaps, the want of just such an act of redemption.
It is here, I think, that one encounlers the real weakness of the whole movement, in both its visual and its verbal aspect, as it has so far shown itself to us. The purity I have mentioned is paid for by a certain thinness. Even Apollinaire's ""Calligrammes"" seem notably less substantial than his other work. The constant fault of whimsicality, wbich one finds in so much concrete poetrv, is perhaps one of the results of this thinness. But to pick upon this alone is not to go to the heart of the matter. The wish to provide a "" total "" experience of the kind I mentioned in my opening sentence was also a wish which was known at the period of the Baroque. Baroque theatre, with its elaborate stage machinery, i;s masques and pageants, was the product of just such a desire. On its less ambitious scale, and with a characteristically modern spareness, concrete poetry trics to do the same thing-to occupy ail our faculties. It is significant that the exhibition at the I.C.A. appeals to the ear as well as the eye-tbere are recordings of the poets reading their own work: either specially created ""sound poems,"" or the verbal translation of the images we see before us.
The dividing line between being occupied and being distracted is, one discovers, v'ery narrow. I found myself delighted by the exhibition as a whole, but unable to regard many of the exhibits as independent works of art in their own right. Concrete poetry is, at the moment, a visual-verbal laboratory from which something wholly convincing has yet to emerge.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS220031330/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=961871ef
Null,Voice of the poets,The Times,1965-Sep-13,"London, England","Voice of the poets
BY PATRIC DICKINSON
Eliot changed his personal voice; his rhythms are neither Boston nor East Coker but rather from Atlantis. English African poetry has at the moment this quality of nowhere, of being translated from a language no one has ever conversed in.
When Samuel Butler went up-country in nineteenth-century New Zealand and visited sheep-farms he found ""gentlemen "" and in one remote place a Tennyson under the bed. He expected and implied class distinctions.
There is no class distinction in the African writers of English poetry: only the distinction between writing well and badly. But they begin now. Africa has no culture in the sense that Greece and India have offered to the West moral ideas and myths of enduring value. Indians if they choose to do so write in English in an entirely different milieu from Africans. A young poet such as Dom Moraes is so sure of India he can afford to write in a purely English tradition-indeed like a Rupert Brooke bereft of 1914. One would not know, a diehard would say, that he was an Indian Waring. This aspect of worldEnglish has disadvantages. Tagore chose. Moraes chooses to write in this, an alien tongue; maybe to think in it. Medieval scholars argued and often thought in the dead language of Latin.
Poetry must be living language. The West Indies-in whose small compass so many bloods and colours mix, whose history is African, European, American -the West Indies seem to me to speak NVhitsun fiery English, basic Waring. Their novelists are already well with us, Lamming or Naipaul. Their poets have about half a dozen modes of English to play with. It is enthralling to read them at it, as assured and as gay as Evan Jones, John Figuera, or Derek Walcott. Rhythmically they are difficult to read (as Robert Frost would be to an English-speaking Italian) for in this sort of world-English the basis of poetry, the rhythmic root, can too easily be unearthed.
But to use this metaphor of earth: we live on it. Over a great space of earth, English is used to communicate, one being to another. This Commonwealth exists, its lingua franca is English. Poets, whatever Shelley meant by "" unacknowledged legislators "", do speak both locally and universaUy. Shakespeare came from Stratford-uponAvon: we know that. Where did his plays come from ? That we shall never know nor need to. There is this Commonwealth and everywhere there are poets in it: where do they come from ? Scholars and geographers can answer. But do they write well ? Yes, and readers from all over the world must find them and enjoy them. Time will ""pardon"" them, in time. But we are here now-in Eliot's words-we must read them now:
Quick now, here now, always-

What's become of Waring
Since he gave us all the slip?
SO BEGINS A POEM of Browning's written over 100 years ago. It is generally assumed that Waring was Alfred Domett (1811-87) and what became of him is well known. He went to New Zealand where he attained high office and went on writing rather turgid and mediocre Victorian verse. Another line of Browning's comes to mind, "" I was never out of England, it's as if I saw it all "".
Let me use Waring as if he were a Commonwealth poet now, and regard his problems. Waring, the New Zealander, comes from a small country. The settlers and the Maoris now live at ease. The Maoris have learnt to speak English: the New Zealanders speak an English a great deal derived from their Scottish ancestors-purer than cockney. The problem of their poets has been and still is to write in a tongue which is their own, a rhythm of speech which reflects their own vernacular. But they do not want to be "" regional "". We in this northern island "" the mole between all Europe and the exile-crowded sea "" smugly think of ourselves as a centre of culture. The emphasis is changing, for America is offering a second sort of English language and culture (a different speech r-hythm), but still young Waring wants to write as a New Zealander and be accepted by a London publisher and have the plaudits of the Sunday critics. I begin with New Zealand for of all the accents of English speech used in the Commonwealth it is nearest to English English. It is perhaps for this reason that young poets such as James K. Baxter and C. K. Stead are able to write as themselves in a tone of voice which is positive. Time, as Auden puts it, "" pardons "" a poet for "" writing well "". This question of writing well seems to vex the Antipodes most-I think because their language is really only ours. The Australians are aggressively national. For example, W. J. Turner is omitted from the Penguin Anthology of Australian Verse because he made his life (and was published) in England, and the same is true of a much younger poet, Peter Porter. Yet the attitude and the rhythms of their work are Australian and are based upon the sound and rhythm of speech they grew up hearing.
The tendency, both in New Zealand and Australia, is to write lyrically about their native lands, but satirically about people here, there or anywhere. I think this springs from their being so closely bound to our one language. No New Zealander or Australian would claim that Domett or Adam Lindsay Gordon were great poets, but they adhere to the English tradition. Young Australasian Waring has read Chaucer and Skelton and Donne and Pope and (possibly) Browning and Tennyson. Far from having to justify being Antipodean young poets such as Nan McDonald or Ray Mathew seem fully alive to the world-fungus of Eng. Lit. and intent upon escaping its growing over them.
Canada being so near to a cognate language has had a far harder time. (I must omit French-Canadian poetry.) To write like a Canadian is half to overhear American speech and, it seems, still half to hear London calling rather louder than Chicago. Writing well in Canada has not come easily. Balladwriters like Banjo Patterson in Australia or Robert NV. Service in
Canada have escaped the problems of more serious poets. Canadian Waring seems only too cognisant of American University broiler-house methods of Lit. Crit. The editors of a recent anthology think Canadian poetry ""can be very interesting if readers and critics, but more especially if school teachers and university professors, begin to see that poetry is the fullest and most adequate expression of our thinking and living "". This has a depressingly dead sound, or would have, if Earle Birney or Douglas Le Pan or David Wevill did not write well, "" whether on the shores of Asia or in the Edgware Road "". There is half of half the problem of Commonwealth poets. For the basically English-speaking, it must matter, but not matter, where they are. It is silly of Australians to resent Turner or Porter living in England: suppose they had opted for Canada-a nation of two languages, French and English ?
In Africa the indigenous populations have been most widely subject to these two languages, NMgritude for Frenchspeaking Africans is a literary attitude which English-speaking Africans are apt to denigrate. But the problem of writing poetry is different for a Nigerian as opposed to a Canadian. He is aware of other languages and English may not be the language he was brought up to think in. The African Waring may still be writing in translation:
One wife be for one man.
I done try go church, I done go for
court
Dem all day talk about di ""new cul-
ture ""
Dem talk about "" equality "", dem men-
tion "" divorce ""
Dem holler am so-tay my ear'nearly
cut;
In this satirical piece young Frank Aig-Imoukhuede is so free in English he can write pigeon, know it, and have a go at western morality in a way wholly different from young David Elworthy having a go at upper-class afternoon tea in New Zealand. African poetry it seems to me iust be (and is) fascinated by language. "" A primrose by the river's brim"" is part of the conventional imagery of exile to Antipodeans or Canadians. To an African, reading Wordsworth must be a mystery. African delight in language is reflected in all their poems, which are preponderantly written without rhyme. Rhyme, we know, was a vulgar innovation in the decline of Rome; and when it came in many of the, poets were writing in a literary language not really their own. African poets like Wole Soyinka or Christopher Okigbo are entrancing and entranced by language. Either they write of people or ideas. There is no yearn for the exposition of landscape to bolster nationality. Their aim is to write like . . . how would this sentence go on ? .. . Like T. S. Eliot ? He may well stand for this sort of expatriate poetry.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS419916077/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=fd0ca757

VADE-MECUM
By Oliver Edwards
When writing of William Watson last week I mentioned the three or four beautifully judged lines T. Earle Welby gave him in A Poputlar History of English Poetry. No sooner had the reference come into my head-seemingly unbidden, as such things do-than it also occurred to me that I should write about that little-known masterpiece. The fact that M. R. Ridley, when writing of the Manx poet Brown in his new book of essays Second Thoughts, makes exactly the same kind o( reference to the neglect of Welby's book need not, I think, deter me.
Welby's heyday was immediately after the First World War. He had been born in India, and up to the age of thirty-nine he had worked mainly there as a journalist. One Man's India, in which he gave word pictures of those years and his reflections on Indian life, is one of his two best works. A small book, it contains the distillation of a sub-continent. Posthumously published at a time (1933) when Indians were even more sensitive than they are now, it was not popular. Yet who will now say he was not right about Tagore ?
In 1920 Welby came to England and settled here for the remaining 13 years of his life. Naturally he turned to journalism for his mainstay. It was, however. of a different kind. He became a writer on The Satuirday Reviewv, and when the split occurred and Gerald Barry gave up the editorship of that paper and founded Tlze Week-end Review Welby went with him.
The fruits of that late blossoming are to be found in two volumes, Back Numbers and Second Impressions. He declared the essays to be table-talk, and repeated the point more than once to distinguish them from criticism. Yet there is plenty of good criticism in them. How refreshing it is to be told-at any rate in middle age-that while "" The N uptials of Attila "" is a very great poem, ""it is also the furious debauch of an imagination rejoicing in barbarism"". Austin Dobson. he said, was a man of genius who had been praised only for his talents. "" It was a very sound artistic instinct that sent Ernest Dowson to the Latin convention in those poems which might be compared with [Thomas] Ashe's."" At the same time, table-talk abounds. Where else would one learn that, contrary to the general belief, Swinburne was not a strong'swimmer ? "" Where he did surpass almost every contemporary was in his ability to float hour after hour, on a rough sea.""
One thing common to all these extracts is that they are about poets. Welby was equally ready to write about Trollope, Disraeli, Wilkie Collins, Froude, Gissing, Samuel Butler, Thomas Hardy, Charlotte Bronte, and Boswell. In The Dinner Knell he engaged in ""table-talk by turns gastronomical, literary, political "". (The Cellar Key is beyond me, as I know nothing about
wine.) But it was poetry first, last, and always, that held primacy in Welby's mind and heart.
He wrote studies of Swinburne and Arthur Symons. He edited, with the most self-effacing discretion, the great collected Landor. He compiled an anthology, The Silver Treasttry of English Lyrics. He wrote A Popular History of English Poetry.
This last was first published by Philpot soon after Welby settled in England. It received a warm welcome but did not make the general stir it should have done. Maybe after the 1914-18 poetic debauch not many wanted a panorama of poetry from Anglo-Saxon and Provencal sources to Masefield and de la Mare. Methuen republished it in 1933, and it is in this handy form that it has been my companion ever since.
Another reason why A Popular H.story of English Poetry may not have had the acclaim it should is that those who have only glanced into it may have remained unbelieving that the triumph Welby in fact achieved was really possible. Such volumes generally fall between two extremes. Either, in order to make the work readable, the author chooses the great names only, writes glowingly about them, and leaves a feeling of inadequacy and incompleteness, or in order to get everyone in, he produces a dull catalogue.
Welby loved the minor poets as well as the major ones. Both his essays and his Silver Treastry show him at home with Barnabe Googe, Ebenezer Jones, Bartholomew Griffin. Chidiock Tichborne. as well as with Milton and Shelley. And when he came to write his Popula, History, he felt he must find a place, even to the length of quoting two stanzas, for Elizabeth Siddal.
Poet after poet, great and small, is presented, judged, placed in literary or historical perspective. Yet the book is unfailingly readable. One can pick it up, open it anywhere, with the guarantee one wiU borrow time from whatever the next engagement is.
There are a number of reasons. One is that the author is one of the greatest and most catholic lovers of true poetry who ever lived. Another, that he moved through his domain with the grace, wit, and assurance of a man who knew every inch of it. On top of these he was a writer who had a running style and could yet make his judgments, where necessary, short and memorable. Lastly he knew exactly when and what to quote.

Null,American Poetry's Casual Look,The Times,1965-Jan-07,"London, England","American
Poetry's
Casual Look
There is an American little magazine that sends out mrocking rejection slips to poets who submit verse in iambic pentameters: This entitles you to one free copy of the next book by Alfred, Lord Tennyson."" That is the more pugnacious side of the main movement in American poetry recently-a movement away from elaborate 'academic"" verse to poetry of a more colloquial style. Walt Whitman was the founding father of this movement, but its main hero nearer in time is William Carlos Williams, the small-town doctor-cum-poet who died last year at the age of 80.
Messrs MacGibbon and Kee have started bringing out in Great Britain all Wiiliams's work: the first two volumes are a varied collection called Pictures from Breughel, and his long poem Paterson. Paterson is an imaginary town in New Jersey which Williams created as his symbol of America, and the poem is a mosaic of lyrical and narrative fragments about the people of this town, interspersed with fascinating newspaper clippings and letters. Sometimes Paterson is itself seen as a man, the townspeople as the Population of his dreams. Open the book ahywhere and a clear Image of some facet of American life springs from it; what it seems to lack is a coherent interpretation of American life, in its drifting pages. Pict,ures from Brueghel, too, is a little too deliber.ately limited to precise, casual-toned description.
Miss Marianne Moore is another longhonoured American poet She too writes in a colloquial vein, but a rnore refincd and fanciful one. Her latest book, Thte Arctic Ox, does not contain anything so. good as the best in her Collected Poe,ns, but the urbane moral lessons she draws here from contemplating giraffes, jellyfish, chameleons and the animal of the title all have her inimitable note-she sets the arctic ox. for instance, with its ""golden fleece and winning ways "". against less desirable animals:
Camels are snobbish
and sheep. unintelligent;
water buffaloes, neurastheniccven murderous.
Reindeer seem over-serious . . .
Miss Anne Sexton is at the other end of the spectrum from Miss Moore. Eveiything Of hers, good or bad, is honest and intense personal confession-how the ""I""1 of the poems felt when not going to her father's funeral, or after having an abortion, Lor trying to commit suicide. There is a moving and dignified truthfulness about
poems like "" The Truth the Dead Know"": Gone, I say and walk from church.
refusing the stiff procession to the grave, letting the dead ride alone in the hearse.
It is June. I am tired of being brave.
But some of her other Selected Poems are too nakedly artless to convey the feelings that obviously prompted them.
The most difficult but perhaps also the most gifted of all these American poets is Mr. John Berryman. His 77 Dream Songs is a collection of short, beautifullyphrased sets of dream thoughts and sensations? not always easy to unravel but evoking an extraordinary range of feelings, with a grave modern humour flashing through them:
There sat down, once, a th;ng on Henry's
heart s6 heavy, if he had a hundred years
& more, & weeping, sleepless, in all them
Henry could not make good. time Starts again always in Henry's ears
the littlo cough somewhere, an odour,
a chime. Two more American volumes must be briefly mentioned: the rather whimsical verses, sometimes depending on almost Victorian word-play, that Mr. John Updike wrote for the hew Yorker, now collected in Telephone Poles; and some delicate sketches, in the new half-whispering voice, by Mr. Donald Hall in A Roof of Tiger Lilies. The last good translations into English of the remarkable Italian poet Bugemio Montale were some done a couple of years ago by the American poet Mr. Robert Lowell, in his Imitations, so perhaps it is also appropriate here to mention a handsomely produced new volume of Montale translations, with the originals facing them. by Mr. George Kay. To read the loose but vivid Lowell versions, Mr. Kay's carefully literal verse translations, and the originals, side by side, is very rewarding even for a reader with no more than a smattering of Italian.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS218720295/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=d54bec71
Null,A Good Autumn Harvest of English Poetry,The Times,1964-Nov-19,"London, England","A Good Autumn Harvest
of En1qlish Poetry
Mr. Robert Graves dominates this autumnt's collection of new volumes of poetry, as he domiiated the autumn of 1962 with his previous book. Man Does, Woman Is represents perhaps an even more congenial mood than that last collection-there, the calmly arrogant image of the poet as "" lion lover"" haunted most of the lyrics; here, the prevailing note is of submissive gratitude to the woman-goddess:
Woman with her forests, moons. flowers. And watchful fingers:
We claim no magic comparable to hersAt best, poets; at worst, sorcerers.
Mr. Graves still has, at his own watchful fingertips, the power to suggest emotion of great purity and intensity, yet does not fail to remind us too of ironic, and comic, human frailty. The combination comes out very sharply, for instance, in a wry song called ""A Phoenix Flame "", where the lover, burning with passion, asks for a nook out of the sun, for
Who could boast a careless wit,
Dkoubly roasted, heart and hide. Turning on the Sun's red spit,
Consumed inside ?
The best book by an English poet of a younger generation this autumn has undoubtedly been Mr. Donald Davie's Events and Wisdoms. There are a great variety of themes and forms in this collectionsketches of places as far apart as California and Chopin's birthplace near Warsaw, incidents from his childhood and his present life, moral reflections and moody lyricsbut a consistent delicacy of diction and an unsparing intetligence run through them all. "" Low Lands "" evokes beautifully the scene in low-lying country-
... slow light spilt and wheeling over
calm
Inundations, and a snake's still menace
looding with bruised sky belfry and
lonely farm-
then passes, by sure twists of the thought to such a landscape's tedium, its defencelessness-and its oddly noble dependence on others' mercy. In most of the poems there is this same quick, easy movement from sight to reflection.
Mr. Paul West also writes vividly about places-Avila, Hokkaido, Burma, a ballpark in the United States. But he lets his harsh, rich portraits yield the feeling he wants from them with much less explicit comment than Mr. Davie. The poems in The Snow Leopard ovoke a world almost bare, too, of the gentle humanism to which Mr. Davie constantly returns. Mr. West's hostile yet colourful universe seems to have sensuous and sensual pleasure to offerbut only to those who can match it in intensity, whether Japanese suicide-pilots, children, or-the inanimate heroine of one of the finest of these poems-a block of new flats at Poggio Reale, Naples:
She flaunts her confidence before all
modern eyes,
Encouraging and yet a sudden world
apart.
Some of these poems seemn slightly loose and unfinished; but they compose a striking volume.
The best poems in Mr. Edward LucieSmith's Confessions and Histories are his very thoroughly-imagined historical monologues. Particularly appealing is his "" Rubens to Helene Fourment "", Rubens's thoughts as he paints the superb portrait of his wife in a dark pelisse that is now one of the glories of Vienna. Mr. LucicSmith gets into words not o'nly the painter's awareness of the dying relationship between him and Helene. but also his in-
comparable sense of her physical beauty. Oher figures successfully brought into these pages are Caravaggio, a fourth-century Grcek among the Scythians, and the Sibyl in her jar.
In Recoveries Miss Elizabeth Jennings offers some careful and sensitive reflections on relationships in hospital, and also some good poems on the relationships between partnts and children. Her concern for tidiness of vision does, however, make her work over-neat at times. Patric Dickinson, in This Cold Universe. is another poet who sometimes allows his skll with lyrical forms to lead him into too artificially balanced conclusions. though his work clearly springs from a romantic and generous spirit. Mr. Gavin Ewart's Londoners is an agreeable if utambitious book-a bit of history, a bit ol atmosphere, all in verse, about places iu London from Barnes Bridge to Harrodi Finally, the late C. S. Lewis's collected Poems do not establish him posthumously as a poet; but some of his sharper-evcu, at times, Plain grumpy-satires have a dash of satisfying force in them, while his slighl,
romantic poems will at least evoke the I man for those who admired him.

The Poetry of
Giselle
Royal Opera House: Giselle
The success of Giselle, like all of the Romantic theatre, depends on its ability to make us suspend not so much our disbelief as our cynicism. We have to feel what Gautier called "" Giselle's pretty death"" and we have, moreover, to feel the poetry of a situation so alien to our age that we must, unconsciously, believe either in fairies (difficult for all but the Peter Pans among us) or, more probably, iu a man obsessed with poetic visions.
It is the sovereign virtue of Giselle as danced by the remarkable partnership of Dame Margot Fonteyn and Mr. Rudolf Nureyev, who returned to the ballet at Covent Garden last night, that they can make Giselle into a poetic experience to be shared with their audience.
In vears to come, when asked whether Dame Margot was a great Giselle, we shall probably answer "" No "" with some reluctance. A great dancer, and ironically enough an always improving Giselle, this has never been among her finest roles and. in spite of the inspiration of Mr. Nurcyev, one imagines that it now never will be. Mvagnificent, honest, and tender. it misses the supreme by the hair's-breadth of simplicitv. Also. perhaps, Dame Margot's dancing is not ideal for Giselle. lt lacks lightness and deliquescence. No one can have everything, and the glowing qualities that have made Dame Margot the Aurora of our age are naturally less at home in this elusive Romantic tragedy.
Mr. Nureyev is, of course, the Albrecht. His shocking choreographic interpolations (how inartistic it is to insert a virtuoso series of entrechais into the last act !), and even his acting mannerisms, were again proved to be of total unimportance in the face of his wild, Lermontov-like poetry, his fevered yet still exquisitely beautiful dancing, and his conception of Albrecht as the man of feeling surrounded by a world of sensation who finds redemption in a tragic love.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS84109144/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=d649acab

The Royal Ballet's choice of programme to open the new season last night possibly looked more impressive on paper than it proved to be on the Covent Garden stage. Undeniably, it would be ditficult to envisage a more suitable ballet to open with than Balanchine's Serenade, but after this beginning the programme appeared to trail away disappointingly, and neither MacMillan's images of Love nor Massine's Mam'zelle Angot left a particularly forcible impression.
Of Serenade it is harddy possible to have enough, and the Royal Ballet dance it with just that mingling of poetry and athletics, of Chekhov and Gecohetti if you like, that halps provide the ballet with its chaaracteristic mood of triumphant elegy. It is first and last a women's baLlet, for the men are used strictly as broodingly Romantic partners, who lift high, emo e much but dance little. The women, as a consequence, have it all their own way. and Balanchine seems actually to merge them with the Tchaikovsky music, giving that music a new dimension and, indeed. a new importance.
The performance, if perhaps the slightest degree below the revival's Premiere last season. was nevertheloss masterly, with the ensemble moving like leaves in the w.nd and the principals, Miss Svetl;na Beniosova, Miss Nadia Nerina, Miss An.nette Page, Mr. David Blair and Mr Donald Mac-Leary, all danoing with that grave but unemphatic ecstasy required.
Mr. MacMillan has removed three episodes from his excursion into ShakesPeariana, Images of Love. These were perhaps among the weakest. one is grateful. Avowedly inspired by Shakespeare's views of love. the ballet adds little to the solemnly intoned quotations it is meant to illustrate. There are, naturally with Mr. MacMillan, many worthwhile passages, including a striking pas de deux for Miss Beriosova and Mr. MacLeary, but the choreography's total effect is almost as slight as the Peter Tranchell music accompanying it.
Mam'zelle Angot Massine's efficient ballet bounfe, developed from a Lecocq oporetta, has not been seen in the opera house for some years. although it was revived last summer at Drury Lane. Miss Merle Park danced with ferocious charm as the eponymous mam'zelie, and is probably the rumbustiously best interpreter the role has ever had. For the rest, despite Mr. Alexander Grant's familiarly bouncy Barber and some excellent portrayals in the smaller parts, the Performance lacked something in spirit.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS269313865/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=66e6b21d

Art drew close to us and the fleeting of time seemed merely one of art's possible themes, when Dame Edith Evans and Mr. Robert Eddison joined last night with Miss Patricia Carroll at the Arts Theatre in the first of three performances of a programme of poetry and music devised by Mr. George Rylands
The words of Keats, Blake, Milton, Shakespeare might, as Dame Edith spoke them, have sounded arrogant in their beauty, if Miss Carroll had not provided the background of another muse, using as an introduction to the first grouD of literarn extracts Bach, to the second Janacek to the third Liszt and to the final. group Schubert. The musicians, offering an alternative to the poets, caused the impact of the poetry to be gentler. They supplied an echo not to Dame Edith's voice but to the vigour of her thought, complementing it, rounding it off.
Mr. Eddison's voice was by contrast that af reason., seeking to establish the why and wherefore of things rather than proclaim their essence.

.The Stratford-on-Avon Festival willopen, as usual, in time for Shakespeare's birthday. The Royal Shakespeare Company begins its conspectus of English history according to Shakespeare-performances eventually in sequence of the history plays from Richard 11 to Richard III-with Richard 11 on April 15 and the Henry IV plays on the following day; the later histories will be added as the season progresses; the cycle will be completed on August 12 and will run until December.
Special quatercentenary celebrations however, crowd the period between April 21 and September 6. A variety of relevant exhibitions, led by that arranged by Mr. Richard Buckle, are available; folk dancing, sometimes British and sometimes international, offers its attractions frequently. The Shakespeare films of Sir Laurence Olivier, Othello in the film versions of Orson Welles and Sergei Yutkevidh, and the Japanese interpretation of Macbeth, The Throne of Blood, together with the Bolshoi Ballet's filnM of Prokofiev's Romeo and Jtliet, are -to be seen. Local schools are taking part. with performances of Twelfth Night and Andre Obey's Noah as well as appropriately Elizabethan entertainments.
Sunday evenings between July 5 and August 20 are to be devoted to ""The 1964 Festival of Poetry "", directed by Mr. Patrick Garland. A series of poems commissioned for. the festival will be heard in the first programme, and that of July 26 will be centred on the work of Mr. Roy Fuller, the ""poet of the year"". Other programmes of readings and music, The Tremendous Ghost and In Praise of Shakespeare, occupy April 26 and 28, while the reopenink of the Stratford-on-Avon canal by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother on July 11 provides an opportunity for fireworks, concerts, and a performance of Henry V.

Much of the music to be heard is directly Shakespearian. PurcelIls The Fairy Queen. conducted by Mr. Anthony Lewis with Miss Jennifer Vyvyan, Miss Honor Sheppard, Mr. John Whitworth, Mr. Robert Tear. and Mr. Trevor Anthony, occupies May 16. Recitals entirely or partly of settings of Shakespeare's lyrics are to be given by Miss Harper and Mr. Richard Lewis (May 19), Miss Ann Dowdall and the Orchestra da Camera. conducted by Mr. Brian Priestman (June 12), and M.

In some New Poetry
Mr. Ted Hughes's new volume of poems is an account of the creatures he has imagined living on the moon. But you don't feel he has simply imagined them; his grave, worried air, with many a head_5haking or bit of homely advice, makes them more real and gives you more shivers than any other kind of talk about them could. Sorne of t;hemn seem to have evoilved along the line of human folly, like the moon-cabbages who are either "" bundles of great loose lips"" or "" bundles of flapping ears "", and whose "" mutual ahnusements resound "". Others seem the embodiment of human dreams, like the earth-owl, which can fly through the moon's substrata with unfal,tering wing. But all live in a terror-ridden environment, where crab-grass, the burrow-wolf who swallows meteorites like marshmallows; and ""the flying strangler, the silent zero "" lord it over the "" snail-saliva silveriness"" which Mr. R. A. Brandt's drawings for the book so well convey. This is Edward Lear's universe, with a new chill in the air.
After his versions of the Russian poet Fyodor Tyutchev, Mr. Chatles Totnlinson now comes up with some free but often brilliant translations of the Spaniard Antonio Machado. He has worked, as before, in collaboration with that polyglot don, Mr. Hcnry Gifford. Machado was an Andalusian who spent some of the most important years of his life among the ""impassive, sturdy"" ilexes of the Castilian mountains, and who found in them a resonant symbol for the people who maintained the gravest and finest of Spanish traditions. His own best poems are like simple, evocative images etched with stone on stone. Mr. Tomlinson has conveyed this effect with his words scored at expressively varying intervals down the page; though in a few caces he overdoes it, with too much of a silent "" hey presto I "" holding us up before each word appears.
Mr. R. S. Thomas is trying to do for Wales something of what Machado did for Castile, He is a more self-conscious poet, torn by his intense loyalty to the men of the ""high ploughland"" and his sense that, especially in recent times, his fellow countrymen have too often become starved and narrow in spirit, like the farmworker
Draped over his bones like a thing To scare birds.
He is a patriot and nationalist without illusions, and some of his poems are bittcr:
Move with the times? I've done that all right: In a few years Buried a nation
None of those farms In the high hills
Have bred children.
My poems were of old men.
The death of two accomplished poets in their middle fifties was a recent tragedy. Bernard Spencer's last book, With Luck Lasting, is full of superb and joyful impressions of moments of time in Greece and Spain and England. Spencer had a quite unique gift for conveying, without comment, the physical impression of a place he
liked and all the excitement it stirred in him. A spring wind:
Spring shakes the windows; doors
whang to,:
the sky moves half in dark and half shining like knives . . . A Spanish dancer:
Back will go the head with the dark curls and the foot will stamp . . .
dry like a thirst the guitar rings.
Louis MacNeice's last volume, The Burning Perch, had more of a cloud bianging over it. Its locale is a ghost-ridden London-sonetimes, as in "" October in Bloomsbury "", wanly lovely, but more often populated by the unforgiving spectres of failure. The strength of the poems is in the deftness and cool lack of self-pity with which these spectres are drawn.
Finally, a verse play, two anthologies and an encyclopedia. Mr. Lawrence Durrell disappoints rather in his play An Irish Faustus. He has set Faustus in the palace of Queen Katherine of Galway, and (as usual these days) made him win the battle when tompted -to give up white magic for black magic. His strongest enemy is not Mephistopheles at all, but the queen who is in love with her vampire husband. TIhis rather crude Gothic note is intermingled with poor mock-medieval hutnour about Martin the jolly pardoner. Mr. Durrell is also the editor of this year's P.E.N. anthology, which has its usual mixture of good Poems and interesting effortsMr. D. J. Enright's con.tdbutions strike one as the best this year. The English Association s Poems of Today gives about two poems each to 79 different poets who have been writing since 1947-a very catholic selectio5n. but with plenty of the plums in it.
The eoncise EncYclopaedia of English and American Poets and Poetry contains much interesting information, but has its oddities. Its short entries on individual poets are Written in a variety of critical styles, from' the one which introduces John Clare as a Poet "" who attained a: liberated purity of sensation and style "", whatever that may mean, to the one that inforrns us that "" William Empson is the oddest English poet who wrote between the two World Wars "". A number of longer articles deal with subjects abstract and historical. like "" Metaphor "" and "" Middle English Lyrics "", where stricter editorial control over style and approach would again have made the book more satisfying.

Royal Court Theatre: Festival . of Poetry
Mr. Eric Mottram's survey of the American poetic scene today (the first of last night's programmes in the current poetry festival), moved from some late verse by William Carlos Williams through poems by Mr. Robert Lowell, Miss Muriel Ruckeyser, Mr. Jonathan Williams, Mr. John Hollander and Mr. Ronald Johnson (all of whom read their own work) to poetry by other young wrliters unknown in Britain.
The programme represented a broadening of horizons from Mr. Lowell's sensitive introsptions, which draw everything he encounters into his private woild. Mr. Wlfiamrs and Mr. Johnson love external facts; Mr. Hoiander and Mr. Ken Coch (one of whose wotks Mr. Hollander read) are almost metaphysical wits. Only Mr. Williams, however, delights in technical variety or the poet's play with words and rhythms; for the most part, this was poetry of assertion through images subsequently analysed.
The second programme brought to light Mr. Patric Dickinson's experi. ment with music. Messrs. Lennox Berkeley, Humphrey Searle. tichard Arnell and Nicholas Maw each provided a setting of Robert Graves's ' C'ounting the beats "", the moving conversation in which two lovers qlietly triumph over the transcience they dread. Mr. Searle uses the poern to express typical intensities of his own. Mr. Arnell and Mr. Maw have set it with rhetorical dcmlamation, asking less acrobatic virtuosity of Mr. Gerald English, who sang each setting sendidly; some of Mr. Maw's vocal phrases .are very beautiful. Mr, Berkeley has composed quiet, intimate music with a flowing melodic line.
As the poem was not the composer's choice, the lively interest of the experiment rather outweighed its arctistic value; at any rate. two hearings were not enough to supply any feeling tlt a real fusion of poetry and music had been achieved. Mr. Berkeley's song, the closest to the mood of the poem, is still miusic expounding a test.
The experiment was followed first by each composer's account of the difficulties he had experienced in setting the intensely thoughtful poem; each agreed thlat, in spite of its easily singable diction, its rapid changes of mood had almost defied musical form; this fact, lUke their avoidance of the obvious musical imagery of heartbeats tat couont "" the bleeding to death of time "", was evident from what they had written. T'hey were then asked to discuss their position as songwriters in relation to Arne's "" Come Away, Death "" (Why not, one wondered, to a song by Dowland, Daniel or Purcell, composers more relevant to their problem ?). Their discussion was amusing, high-spirited, clever and livelv. Naturally enough, it Produced no statement of really substantial value; the songs themselves covered all the points raised.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS218326257/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=b68b1f34

Strong Contrast
Royal Court Theatre: Festival
of Poetry
Two programmes will be presented on each of the six days of the 1963 Festival of Poetry, which the Poetry Book Society has promoted in association with the Arts Council. On the first day, yesterday, an anthology entitled ""The Rebel "" was followed later in the evening by "" Poets and Poems "", which consisted for the most part of readings by four poets from their own work.
There was an enormous difference betiveen the two. "" The Rebel "". which Mr. Patrick Garland had arranged and prodAuced on behalf of ithe Apollo Society, was, considered as a programne, a professional piece of work. Five speakers and two singers providing their own acoompanimsent. all of them men, put on the stage something that was in its way a piece of "" theatre "".
They wove their way in and out between three movable screens, leaving the stage now to one man, now to a group, as though a meeting of the Jacobin Club were being held, at whicb members, istead -of making their own speeches, quoted from MWlton, D. H. Lawrence, Ned Kelly, Robert Enmext, James Joyce. and others.
Late in the evening we heard Cain saying that he did not know wihere A-bel was and asking whether he was bhis brother's keeper. Did Mr. Garland intend to remind us that every other man is ou,r brother and to suggest that the rebel's defiance of society is at bottom a protest against our forgetfuiness of that relaftionSip ? If so, this would supply his anthology with a connecting link. in the absence of wbich the rebeLs' defiance seemed to have no moral basis. As it was, the argument of Dostoevsky's Grand Inquisitor to the effect that man. though bornaa rebel, is only haff a rebel and with the other aflf of hiimself craves ,to be told what to do, went unanswered when Mr. Peter Bowles delivered ftwith much forme at -the end of the proramme.
"" Poets and Poems"" was not a piece of ""theatre "".

With the connivance of the weather, the Regent's Park auditorium last night had one of its comparatively rare opportunities of becoming one of the most delightful of theatres, adding, as extraneous noises died away, its own magic to a play that often seems to need the aid of as much enchantnent as possible.
Mr. David William's production, if it does not aim at the spectacular mannered elegance which Sir John Gielgud has taught us to associate with this work, has the merit of being consistently worked out, so that the fantastic improbabilities of laaudio and Hero go properly in counterpoint with the emotional growing up of Beatrice and Benedick. Furthermore, it is designed effectively to bring out the best in its players; it is not imposed upon them but evolves from their personalities and talents.
Thus, if we are not altogether convinced, we are kept interested, amused and happy for most of the time, watching a delightful quality of happy serenity in Miss Jill Dixon's Hero and a lively forthrightness in Mr. Bernard Lloyd's Claudio. Mr. Michael Blakemore's Dogberry has a magnificent opinion of himself, but could bear a riper fruitiness of voice. The Beatrice and Benedick of Miss Ann Morrish and Mr. Denis Quilley are sensibly interpreted and played with effective directness. Their afwitatin the early scenes is not an affectation of enormous superiority but an adolescent game which they continue just a little belatedly to enjoy; the mock calamity of Hero's disgrace forces them to grow up, and they do so effectively.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS252404939/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=d95ec448
Null,Everything And The Kitchen Sink Between Paper Covers,The Times,1962-Dec-20,"London, England","Everything And The Kitchen Sink
Between Paper Covers
The flood continues, with an average of five or six new paperbacks published everv day. As usual, many, of these recall Swift's phrase, ""sweepings from butchers' stalls, dung, guts, and blood"", but when they have bobbed away or sunk a great deal of good reading remains. Substantal reinforcements have come this year from some American series which are now more readily available, no:ably the excellent Signet Classics, Collier Books, and Barron's Educational Series. There has been a welcome increase of poetry and drama, several good art books, and some useful symposia; and paperbacks have moved still more firmly into Europe, not only with translations but also with more books in the original languages, such as W. H. Allen's Collection lnternationale.
Those long-distance runners, the Penguins, are now -far from lonely, but they are still in the lead. They have launched two new series this year, Peregrines and Peacocks. The latter, designed for what are sometimes called ""tween-agers "", are very wishy-washy: there seems to have been some misapprehension about what young people like to read. The Peregrines were introduced rather self-consciously as "" egg-head Penguins "", of "" more specialized appeal than Pelicans""; in 'what way they are more specialized is not clear, particularly as one of the latest batch, Carcopino's Daily Life in Ancient Rome. appeared in 1956 as a Pelican. Still, this is a good series. mainly of literary criticism..
Penguin have also contributed substantially to the poetry and drama collections. Their new series of Modern Poets, arranged troika fashion. has started well, and they have brought out volumes of Yevtushenko and Rimbaud. Georgian Poetry, Latin Verse at.d Ch;2lese Verse; but their anthology The New Poetry is disappointing. Routledge are reissuing some of the Muses' Library in paperback; Evergreen Books offer an absorbing collection of Lyrics of thle Middle Ages, and Collier have The Spoonl River Anthology and Swift's Poems. There is a Selected Yeats (St. Martin's Library) and a Collected Betjeman (Murray). a fine bilingual edition of S-J. Perse's Seamarks (Harper). and Thom Gunn and Ted Hughes share a Faber volume.
Drama ranges from Henry Livings, Alun Owen and John Whiting (the latest Penguin New English Dramatists) to Leo Kirschbaum's scholarly edition of Marlowe (Meridian) and the 1603 Quarto of Hamlet (Barron). In between are Williams. Wilder, Sartre, Pirandello and various Irishmen, all in Penguin. Strindberg (Ancbor) and
Cocteau (Oxford). The admirable Methuen Modern Plays continue, Hill and Wang are reprinting some of the old Mermaid series, and Barron have a good list of Theatre Classics. Criticism includes Gordon Craig's Thle Art of thle Tlheatre (Mercury) and Ma7vin Herrick's valuable Tragicomedy (Unive7sity of Illinois).
There has been a remarkable number of books on Russia. including Hans Kohn's The Mind of Modern Russia (Harper), xerdyaev's The Russian Revolution (Ann Arbor), and such useful source-books as The New Communist Manifesto (Harper) a'nd Marx on Econiomics (Pelican). There is even more on American history and Politics; pride of place must again go to Hlarper, who are bringing out an edition of the definitive Morris and Commager series The New American Nation. They are also issuing some important works of American scholarship in the Langer series Thle Rise of Modern Europe. At home, Churchill's History of the Etnglish-Speaking Peoples (Cassell) and Toynbee's A Studv of History (Oxford) add their idiosyncratic solidity to the lists. and, among more specialized studies. Alan Bullock's Hitler (Penguin) stands out.
The symposia range widely. A notable collection is Twentieth Century Views (Spectrum), writers so far covered including Camus, Eliot, Whitman and Fielding. Writers at Work (Mercury), The Permanence of Yeats (Collier), A Century of Darwvin (Mercurv), Angola: Viewvs of a Revolt (Oxford) and Continuity and Chanige in African Cultures (Phoenix) indicate the range, and there are twvo massive and useful compilations in Readings in Modernt World Civilizaation (Macmillan, N.Y.) and European Political Institutions (Van Nostrand).
Scientists cont;nue to be well catered for, particularly by Dover. Cambridge and Paperrnacs. Dover include among the,r subjects Superfluids, Canonical Matrices, Continuous Groups of Transformations and vwnhat ought surely to be a children's book-Charles Babbage and his Calculating Engines. The interested layman is admirably served by Pelicans and such studies as Sherwood Taylor's Science Past and Present (Mercury). while Dover's reprint of the 1665 edition of Robert Hooke's Micrographia is an appealing curiosity.
Among the art books should be mentioned the Fontana Unesco Series (Collins) small, cheap, and very well Produced. Larger and dearer, but also good, are Thames and Hudson's Concise Histories of Art. by Gerrnain Bazin. and Modemr Painting. by Sir Herbert Read. Rothenstein s Modern English Painters occupies two Arrow volumes. and Hauser's Social History of Art four from Routledge.
Fiction, home and foreign, can no doubt speak for itself. Joyce Carey makes a welcome return to the lists of Pensnuin and

Lenin is firmly the hero of some of his most forceful poems, but he is called in one, with a fine painful complexity, ""barbarian saviour of civilization""; in another it is Rilke who is set by Lenin's side, the basis of Mr. MacDiarmid's comparison of them being that everything that either had to do with

Dame Edith Sitwell. her collected Poems behind her, offers 10 new poems in The Outcasts. They have her familiar fine mesh of music in them, but in the thoughts they express only show the broad lines of noble generalizations about life. Mr. Edmund Blunden, in A Hong Kong House. makes a larger addition to his previous Poems of Many Years: his wellknown gift for gentle and delicate comment on unnoticed beauties of nature or spirit is as strong as ever.
A group of poets all round about their forties have brought out volumes at the same time and give a good impression of the prevailing tone on the more crowded roads of English poetry at the moment. It is surprising how much they have in common-they let casual incidents in their Life push them into some brief reflection. romantic or wry or both at once, without carrying the thought farther than necessary to make a passable poem; they worry, in poems about the value of poetry; if they break into deeper thought. as like as not the echoes of Yeats's sense of the conflict between imagination and morality sound strong in them still.
But each of these four manages to achieve some personal note within the dominating convention Mr. John HeathStubbs, in The Blue-Fly in lhis Head, never drops his dandy's manner as he weaves his classical parallels to modern trivialities, or lays down his wit as careful-casually as he would a pair of gloves on the table.

An exciting book of a very different kind is Inmitations. a set of free versions of some great European poems Dy the American Robert Lowell. They would not be good *:ribs to the originals. but are done with an amazing vigour of language that still keeps the originals' tone: the Baudelaires shock, just as they must have shocked France a hundred years ago. the Paster-

Here. especially, from his carly voltimes, are some of the keenest-edged and most touching love-lyrics of the century, and here too are discursive pieces and broadsides that embody a massive attempt to consider the horrors and glories of European civilization as seen through Scottish eyes, and the kind of personal and artistic life that can be lived within it now. The manv poems written in Scots should not deter the reader --there is a good glossary. and those words that are not glossed quickly reveal their meaning as they recur from one poem to another. The effort is worth it: Mr. MNacDiarmid will clearly leave his mark on ts.
Mr. Rov Fuller's Collected Poemns are also a solid achievcment. but it takes the form of a thoroutgh testimony of disenchantement.

Wistful Poetry
If it is to attract a large audience, a concert on a hot Sunday evening in July must needs present a popular prograrnme. Last night's Festival Hall concert by the Philharmonia Orchestra under Mr. Alexander Gibson conformed to this notion by including the violin concertos of Brahms and Tchaikovsky; but it was not altogether oh popular lines, for it began with Beethoven's overture Leonora No. 2, which is far less frequently heard than the later sister work, and it also contained Mozart's rarely performed Symphony No. 32 in G. AlH in all, it was a well-planned programme.
Mr. Henryk Szeryng was the soioist in the concertos. If any doubt still lingered in our minds as to bis position amrong front-rank violinists, it was completely dispelled by last night's performance. True, Mr. Szeryng's tone is on the small side and this told perhaps most in the Brahms. But it is a tone rnost refined and of the utmost suppleness, brilliant of colour and, so far as its restricted strength will allow, capable of a warm, sensuous expression.
This he combines with a technique that is not only faultless but dazzling ip the effortless ease with which he surmounted the steep hurdles in thc Tchaikovsky. Indeed it was the latter work that revealed the full measure of Mr. Szeryng's virtuoso style, with runs, arpeggios, and ra,pid staccato passages being brought off with an incredible brilliance and verve. And into the lyrical portions (particularly the Canzonerta) he infused a sentiment of gentle, wistful poetry that was admirably suited to Tchaikovsky's me.lodic vein.
Equally impeccable in all technical respects was the Brahms, but here Mr. Szeryng seemed somewhat inhibitedat any rate the first two movements demanded a more immediate approach and greater emotional warmth than he was able to demonstrate. Nor did he pay enough attention to Brahms's giocoso marking in the finale, but it was played with much brio and rhythmic address. Mr. Gibson partnered his soloist most accurately and sympathetically, piloting his players with a sure hand through the perilous reefs and shoals of the concertos.
The account Mr. Gibson gave of the overture was neatand precise, if perhaps lacking strong dramatic accents, while the symphony received a stylish and well.shaped performance.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS101278434/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=13f550bc

Null,"Candour, Clarity and Compassion in Modern Verse",The Times,1961-Sep-28,"London, England","Candour, Clarity and Compassion
in Modern Verse
Three or four years ago there was much talk in the literary papers of the new "" Movement "" in English poetry-a fresh wave of poets all dedicated to candour and clarity and economy of language in their verse. Now three of the poets given pride of place in the group by the literary journalists have just published new collections. They give a vivid picture of where the "" Movement"" is moving.
Many readers must be familiar with Mr. Kingsley Amis's comic self-torturing selfappraisals-to be found in his witty verse as well as his novels. Mr. Thom Gunn is an Amis with the thumbscrews turned a dozen timos tighter. But, whereas MT. Amis laughs and runs away from his ghastly views of himself, Mr. Gunn stands and looks firm at his colder and harsher portraits. And in the gazing he reconciles himself. in his way, to their harshness Sheer existence, in fact, whatever its quality, can gratify Mr. Gunn-when it is clearly apprehended he feels in it an unfailing intensity. Various poems in MY Sad Captains present fearful but awed portraits of old lechers and young, and vivid moments of delighted insight into the almost empty wonder of teddy-boys' minds. looters', and snails'. A superb poem, "" A Man of the City "", ends:
By the recurrent lights I see
Endless potentiality.
The crowded, broken, and unfinished I
I would not have the risk diminished. Yet he always, it would seem, sees what the risk is. This kind of candour. leaving one with the ice that burns in one's hands. is the finest and hardest of all, and these look like some of the most important poems to have been written since the end of the war.
MT. John Wain's candour is of a different kind. He is, perhaps, too worried ever to be a very good poet. Mr. Gunn has a liberal lucidity of vision: Mr. Wain, going farther in one way but nothing like so far in another, 'has a liberal concern. He is concerned, often movingly, with nuclear weapons, the state of poetry, America, murderers. and his own character. But his anxious language is often more rhetorical or sociological than poetic, even though the very neat stanzas he employed in the early days of the "" Movement "" have given way here to more varied sets of rhythms. Weep Before God stops at the halfway mark in the purposes of poetry: it shakes up and leaves one shaken up. But it does that Job very well.
Miss Elizabeth Jennings wrote some of the best English personal poems of the last decade, Donne-like but delicate. Her darting. searching mind is still at work in Song for a Birth or a Death, but so agitatedly now that she tells us, paradoxically, less than she used to. She aims at
being complex without, one feels, being really open. There are some rather impre&s&ive poems here about being in love with a man under vows, but it is impossible to tell if he is monk or priest, or simply a married man. This is not vulgar inquisitiveness-one has no personal curiosity about Miss Jennings, one simply wants to know properly what state of mind she is in fact writing about. Oddly, her manner of writing remains cool and collected in spite of th^ese disturbed questionings -one tinks of struggling cocooned victimns helplessly stirring a neat web.
To pass to names much longer familiar, Mr. Louis MacNeice offers us in Solstices a new collection of those diary-poems at which he is so good. For sheer ease, knowingness, and ready magic a little poem called ""Nature Notes"" beats all these three younger poets. But Mr. MacNeie, even in his poems about his fears, is relaxed and comfortable in a way none of the younger ones is.
The Selected Poems of the American poet Mr. Conrad Aiken take us back to the sp.rit of 40 years ago. These massive works of introspective symbolism, packed at the same time with Wordsworthian intuitions and Keatsian sensuousness, are a sort of hinterland to the poetry of Mr. T. S. Eliot and Mr. Ezra Pound. One may read them for their wonderful richness; in addition, with their manifold allegiances, they throw a light all round on European and English and American poetry of the twentieth century.
Other latter-day words: in New Poems 1960 Mr. Witter Bynner, an American now in his eighties, offers us some strangely disconcerting and touching Chinese-like images; in Later Poems Mr. Austin Clarke, writing from within the Roman Catholic cburch, brings together many years of pungent satire on obscurantism in Eire. and the Collected Poems of Mr. Ralph Hodgson, 90 this year, remind us of that true feeling of his for nature and romance already loved by readers in the pre-Eliot days.

Mermaid Tbeatre: 'Tis Pity She's a
Whore
Since the dramati-t's attitude to his own lurid material is still a matter for debate among scholars, Ford's seething amalgam of incest, violence, and protracted kllling is a challenge to directors. Mr. David Thompson justifiably stages it with the sensationalism of an X certificate film, yet keeps the steely narrative in sight througb all the hysteria. What is more, there are passages in which the poetry comes through to impose its controlling shape. Mr. John Carruthers's set, on two levels of restrained strapwork outline, and his costumes, richly manageable, allow for a fast pace.
The play can be taken as a cynical distortion of Romeo and Jlliet, its lovers now brother and sister, the nurse a courtesan. At the Mermaid, Miss Patience Collier's amoral servant suits the pattern exactly. So does Miss Zena Walker's Annabella, whose capitulation is as convincing as the sly, knowing flirtatiousness which follows it almost at once. The initial surrender carries an authority which saves her from becoming despicable, even when she flutters her eyelashes at Soranzo, the suitor chosen as dupe to conceal her crnme. This, we are given to understand, would in normal circumstances have been her choice. For a moment or two, she senses it, before destiny moves her on.
Meanwhile, subsidiary characters realisticaDly die from sword and poison, no symptom spared. It is to foreshadow the final butchery to which the incest and the vengeance for it will lead. Miss Barbara Barnett, an uninhibited plotter alternating between fury and intrigue, gives the most chilling of these warnings. After her death scene last night the silence was complete. The action continues in another key and is ready for a tragic dimension not quite achieved.
By this time the lovers and Soranzo, insolently played by Mr. David Sumner, should be isolated in a balance of conflict until Ford's intention to discredit Soranzo takes effecL If the lovers fail here to unite in a tragic defiance, the fault lies in Mr. Edward de Souza's Giovanni, who lacks the personality to be an adequate partner in crime of Miss Walker. A troubled gravity, casualty fluent and rhetorical where the verse demands a slow, terrible drumbeat, makes Giovanni seem more like the victim of a brawl than the anti-hero who has willed his own destruction. Mr. de Souza acquits himself well in the last of several athletic fights but his director unkindly leaves Giovanni's corpse too far downstage for any actor to conceal his breathing.
In compensation for this weakening of the crisis, the production offers new insight into Vasques, the servant who appoints himself a tutor of revenge. Mr. John Woodvine asserts himself from the outset as a surly ruffian in command of every situation, and his brief talk with Miss Collier is seen to be the action's decisive twist. lago achieved little more.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS185295134/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=d64361a0

By G. S. Fraser
I am a lecturer in English literature in a provincial university and used to be a professional reviewer of new books, especially books of poetry and about poetry. It is very hard for me to know when I am reading for pleasure and when reading is work. I treat all books in a sinisterly professional way.
Even when I intend to read a novel merely for pleasure I find myself looking at the first sentence, and then at the last sentence. I read about twelve pages in the middle, to get the general tone and texture, and then leaf back and forwards to fill in the gaps. This is the quickest and most efficient way of arriving at a rough general estimate of the book's merits. If the estimate is really favourable I read it again, from beginning to end, at a much more leisurely pace. Similarly with a new volume of poems or critical essays I skim over the pages or the Paragraphs with a lacklustre eye until I come upon some piece of prose or verse on which I really bark my shins; then I start reading, backwards and forwards from that centre, slowly and appreciatively.
But even when I am reading in this more ruminative way, am I really reading for pleasure? If I have a pen or pencil handy, I cannot stop myself from sidelining cogent paragraphs or underlining striking lines of verse. I put a lively volume of criticism down on a table, and walk up and down my work-room, arguing with it. Struck with a new poem, what I am first noticing is rhythm, cadence, turn of phrase; I murmur lines and phrases aloud to myself, and if somebody looks over my shoulder and asks, "".What is this poem about ?1"" I have to shake myself awake, and skim over the poem with a cold prose eye, before I can give a cogent answer.
In all the reading of a professional reader like myself there is, of course, a special egotistic pleasure, the pleasure of exercising a skill. One comes to know certain poems, certain passages of prose, as a conductor knows a score, and one does not so much read them as perform them to oneself. Or one expounds them to others. Scholars who have worked very hard for years on the sources and symbols of very difficult poets, like Blake and Yeats, have told me that after a certain stage any natural and spontaneous delight in the obvious, surface splendour of the work of these poets left thern ; they felt that they could never look at a poem by Blake or Yeats again, merely to enjoy it. I am no scholar. But it is true that going over a difficult poem by Donne or Hopkins, say, with an intelligent student is much less like pointing out to a companion the glories of a sunset than like teaching a clever child how to take to bits and put together again a mechanical toy. The life, the flesh-and-blood glow, has to be taken for
granted; what lends itself to exposition is syntax, logic, argument, the articulation of a skeleton. The great Lord Hartington, not a literary man, in his later years casually picked up, one day, a copy of Paradise Lost, and slowly read a page or two: "" How fine that is "", he said, "" I had forgotten how fine it was ! "" The tutor or lecturer may occasionally murnur, "" How fine that is ! "" to remind his class that he is a human being. But that is not what he is paid for doing. And similarly the first-year student of English literature who wants to express his excitement about poetry in the manner, say, of Lamb or Pater will soon get his knuckles rapped. What we want from him is the rigour of the game, eye on the object, argument, point, relevance.
The pleasure of reading for a teacher or critic of literature is, in essence, a professional pleasure. He is never really away from the shop. But I have some tastes in reading which are eccentric, whimsical, and perhaps childish. The books that I read most nearly purely for pleasure are, I suppose, the books that I read in bed for half an hour before going to sleep. For years my favourite bedside book was a cheap two-volume edition of Lord Morley's Life of Gladstone. This is not a biographical masterpiece; somebody has said that of the three chief passions of Gladstone's life, religion, finance, and Ireland, Morley properly understood only the third; and his style has been described as looking like marble from a distance but, closer, like blancmange. At the period, however, of the Suez crisis and of Hungary I found something inexpressibly soothing in diving, as one dives under the blankets, into the solid comfort and sedateness of the Victorian age, into Gladstone's voluminous rhetoric and agile and troubled conscience as these fastened themselves on problems which, serious enough in their time, seem to us now happily anchored in a secure age.
I have read again and again, also, before going to sleep a chapter or two of that very lively but certainly not profound or subtle or consistently characterized Irish comic romance, Charles Lever's Harry Lorrequer. Another Irish book I like is an old volume, in small print, of Curran's speeches, their rhetoric an inextricable compound of the tawdry and the sublime; and yet another, by an author as funny and brutal as Smollett but not so coarse, is Sir John Barrington's memoirs. But the professional reader, even when half asleep, is still sleepily on duty; Curran and Barrington have helped me to understand Yeats; Morley, for that matter, gives me a grand, dense feeling of the world in which Tennyson and Arnold moved. The professional reader is nevei not on duty; but he is never, if he is a good professional, without pleasure either.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS252010717/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=2c07386b

PLEASURE IN READING
By Rebecca West
Sometimes one's reading, when it strays from the course determined by one's current work, describes a circle. If the book is important enough to send one out on the tour of questioning among other books it is often able to answer the questions they ask in their turn. I have just come back after some weeks of such travelling to the pleasant places where I began.
In Thie Oipltic Voice, a study of the relationship between poetry and science by the English scholar Elizabeth Sewell, I have been fascinated by the exposition of what the poets and philosophers of our culture felt that the ancient world -was telling them about themselves when it invented the myth of Orpheus. That sent me back to Tue Metamorphoses, for none of them quoted a speech there ascribed to Orpheus which has always struck me as marvellous even for that marvellous work.
When Orpheus goes down into the underworld and begs Pluto and Persephone to give him back his bride Eurydice, he says: "" I have tried to bear her loss, and I will not deny that I have really made an effort to get over it. But Love defeated that."" Then the verse becomes hesitant, as if he doubts whether anything real to men kept its reality in this place of shadows. ""Love "", he explains ""is a god whom we human beings know very well. But I am not sure if you know him here. But I rather think "", he goes on, "" you must. After all, if there is any truth in that old story of an abduction-"" and suddenly his hesitancy leaves him. He comforts the gods with a firm statement to the gods: Vos quoquie iunxit Amnor. Love joined you also.
Orpheus shows himself both modest and proud. He assumes that the gods do not share all human emotions, because they are superior beings. But he claims an absolute value for love, which must be conceded by gods and men alike, who by that concession achieve a splendid equality.
I went on reading Ovid for some time, but presently I found myself haunted by the suspicion that somewhere in our literature another great man had shown a mortal addressing much the same sort of inquiry to an immortal, with less happy results. And I was right. It occurs in the eighth book of Paradise Lost, where the angel Raphael is coming to the end of a visit so lengthy that it began in the fifth book ; and the conversation, which started magnificently with an exposition of the celestial wars, has turned to general matters and has deteriorated.
Adam asks some quite intelligent questions about astronomy and Raphael discourages the scientific spirit ("" Think only what concerns thee and thy being "") with a severity unimpressive because he is evidently not sure of the answers. ("" But whether these things be, or whether not. . . . "") Next Adam seeks advice regarding the relationship between the sexes, and when Raphael replies, in a style which unfortunately recalls the style of Polonius, he seems much more sure of his ground than when he was talking about astronomy.
Perhaps for that reason, Adam then inquires:
Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask; Love not the heavenly spirits, and how
their Love Express they, by looks only, or do they
mix Irradiance, vir.ual or immediate touch? It is in essence the same question that Orpheus asked Pluto and Persephone,
but surely he asks it with better spiritual manners, and Raphael's reply sets Adam no good example.
To whom the Angel with a smile that
glow'd Celestial, rosy red, Love's proper hue, Answer'd, Let it suffice thee that thou
know'st Us happy, and without Love no
happiness, Whatever pure thou in the body
enjoy'st (And pure thou wort created) we enjoy In eminence . . .
But after a more refined fashion. It is strange that Ovid makes Orpheus speak as a Christian might who knelt before an altar to pray that a purely human affection might be preserved, while Milton makes Adam and his angelic visitant converse with a materialism much more comprehensible in a pagan world where religion and folk-lore were inextricably entangled.
Well, the great sometimes fall below their greatness; and I turned to a book which robs that reflection of any melancholy, Claudel's AMemoires Imnprovises, perhaps the silliest work any man of talent has ever produced, but not unlikable. My favourite passage is his denunciation of the contemporary American woman for her coldness and luxury, from which he kindly exempts the wives of the trappers who so bravely accompany their husbands on their journeys into the interior. But I had forgotten his shocking remark that the first two hundred pages of Dostoevsky's The Idiot is a masterpiece of composition which recalls the masterpieces of Beethoven. Not just one; all of them.
Though authors tend to write gassily about music, musicians often make good hard-headed authors. 1 turned to one of them at this moment, to that fiery and isolated spirit, Mr. Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji, the gifted composer and pianist and critic; for he contributed to the volume issued as a memorial to the great Russian Medtner a turbulent essay containing a number of good things including a denunciation of "" difficult music "" in which it is possible for a performer to make a mistake "" without anyone being a penmy the wiser "". Medtner's music, he points out, was extremely elaborate, but if at any performance there had been a blunder, it would have been recognized at once by every instructed listener, as an interference with the composer's design. In fact, intricacy is not the same as difficulty. If the governing intention and the craftmanship be strong enough, elaboration comes as smoothly to the mind as simplicity.
At that back I went to Miss Sewell, who prints at the end of her book 13 "" working poems"" which she wrote at the same time. They are intricate and crystalline. Back I went to Paradise Lost, al! but the passages when Raphael stayed too long. Back I went to The Metamorphoses, which I opened this time at the page where Iris is arousing Somnus as he lies among the stored dreams of mankind. The idea of the awakening of the god of sleep from his sleep has its complications. Ovid deals with them in four words: Excussit tandem sibi se. He shook himself free of himself. I have been reading Milton and Ovid every night since then, now one and now the other. Very pleasant it is, but I get less and less sure (in spite of their reputations) which is the Christian and which the pagan.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS285565128/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=a9456d3e

INNOVATION BY BARRAULT
FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
PARIS, APRIL 10
It is only since he was appointed director of the Od6on-Theatre de France that M. Jean-Louis Barrault has been able to demonstrate in practical terms his ideas concerning the role of the theatre in modern life. M. Barrault believes that the theatre should be used as a centre for all the arts, and within the past two years he has organized exhibitions of paintings, lectures. concerts. and pantomime programmes at the Odeon.
Guerre el Poesie, the latest addition to his repertory, is a monza.ge of poems with music and film projections, and can therefore be considered as the logical extension of his theories into the domain of poetry. It is not, of course. the first time that M. Barrault has presented a programme of verse. His series of extracts from the works of Shakespeare. Sartre. and Claudel linked by a text and commentar:es have met with some success botb in France and abroad. But Gu,erre el Pofsie. which has been devised by M. Henri Pichette, is considerablY more than the spectacle poOiquegenerally characterized by a complete lack of theatrical impact-tfiat is commonly mounted in France.
M. Pichette's programme is intended to be the first of a series devoted to various universal themes; the series will continue in the autumn with a programme entitled Amoureuse Poesie. He has assembled in the present one an anthology of epic, lyrical and satirical verse, with a few prose extracts for good measure, on the theme of war, and he has built up a coherent programme which becomes almost a poetic drama by the judicious use of music, lighting changes, and film and still projections. A simple abstract decor based on geometrical forms by M. James Pichette is used as the setting, and the poems are presented without introduction by actors in their ordinary dress.
It is a far cry from the romantic views of the medieval warrior poet to the reasoned horror of the contemporary pacifist, yet M. Pichet:e's cunning use of photography and the frequent insertion of songs and music seemed to make this transition smooth and somehow inevitable. An unusual aspect of the programme, which no doubt played its part in the general cohesion, was the omission of any reference to the authors except in the programme, where they are listed in chronological order from the thirteenth-century Bertran de Born to those still living.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS68247691/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=2b5b770a

POETRY
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S
DREAM
Mr. Michael Langham's productidn of A Midsummer Night's Dream, wvhich was received with vociferous applause at the Old Vic last night, has a good deal to recommend it. Mr. Langhamn has approached the play with a comic inventiveness that is really fresh although, at times, he seems inclined to show his author how funny the play can be if a gifted producer is given a free hand.
Some of Mr. Langham's inventions are only gimmicks-the play opens with a hymeneal chant and pseudo-dervish dance before the entry of a manacled Hippolyta -but the imbroglio of the four lovers is freshly and cleverly handled. One cannot help thinking of the production in terms of its producer than its actors.
Though. in one sense, the funnier the play is the better is the effect it makes, funniness is not its total content. Mr. Langham sees it as an essentially realist play in which imaginative lyrical bubbles are burst and an unlyrical truth manifested. Mr. Campbell, when Bottom is translated, has a splendid braying guffaw, and this is released to salute the end of Titania's numarks about the flowers V'lamenting an enforced chastity "".
Mr. Humphry's Theseus is abruptly businesslike with his poetry, and the lovers are encouraged to eloquence only whilst they are spell-bound. Even Oberon seems to think of the bank ""where on the wild thyme grows"" in terms of a comfortable hotel near Charing Cross, and only allows us to feel the delight of his poetry when assuring Puck that they are spirits of another sort. Mr. McCowen moves splendidly and looks like a supernatural royalty, but he seems to be unconscious of the ecstasy that is his essence.
This ecstasy, which never denies laughter. should touch everyone in the play before the curtain falls; we noticed it in Miss Leigh-Hunt's realization of victory, Demetrius being hers, and in Bottom's awakenlng: elsewhere, it was missing. Mr. Courtenay's masculine, mischievous Puck is pleasant, Miss Dench is volatile and attractive; Mr. Stride and Mr. Meacham are equally lively. The mechanicals have an odd assortment of accents.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS151347093/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=b6ea631c

DEAD BEAT
By George Cloyne
I have been sent an anthology. This, I should add, is not a rare occurrence. I am sent anthologies of Imagist Poetry, of Apocalyptic Poetry, of poetry ranging from Dada to the Movement. This time it is The New American Poetry, 19451960. And I have read it.
When I say "" read "", I speak a little less than the truth. For a certain proportion of the book is not strictly readable. The writers who contribute to it -and they include those of the Beat Generation, of the San Francisco Renaissance, the Black Mountain Group, and the New York Poets-are not particularly well-known in this country, with the exception of Mr. Jack Kerouac, Mr. Allen Ginsberg, and Mr. Lawrence Ferlinghetti. They have this in common: that their poems are commonly written for recitation rather than reading. Boomed out to a jazz accompaniment, they might seem better than on the cold page. A listener could at least take refuge in the jazz. But what interests me is that the volume contains a set of ""Statements on Poetics "". It ought, therefore, to be possible to discover exactly what this new poetry is trying to do.
Ever since Mr. Eliot made the critics appear ridiculous more than 40 years ago by edging his way, like a rockclimber, towards the summit, without being noticed by observers in the plain, very few commentators have shown much courage when it came to assessing new kinds of literature. They have been afraid of the unfamiliar, afraid of the young, afraid of their own impercipience. Thumbing my way, in gingerly progress, through poems which mark the mind no more profoundly than a fly marks the window-pane (and often in much the same fashion), I have decided to accept the role of fogy which is thrust upon me. Longing to respond, longing to feel at home in a world of bearded bards in boxcars travelling widdershins through the subconscious, I have been studying in particular the pronouncemerits of Mr. Charles Olson, who seems to be the theoretician of what he calls Projective Verse. ""Form "", I learn, ""is never more than an extension of content."" Every poem has to find its own appropriate energy, it has to move fast from one perception to another. It may seem, therefore, that Mr, Olson has been reading the preface to Lyrical Ballads, a supposition made the more probable by the fact that his further rules are paraphrased from Coleridge into an awkward version of Basic
Jargon. But the point he is making is only related to what used to be called free verse when Laforgue wrote it, and later turned, with surrealist help, into the poetry of free association. It can be witty and charming-there are poems of both kinds in this anthology; it can even (as in Mr. Ginsberg's celebrated "" Howl "") generate a certain animal grandeur. What it cannot do is to achieve its aim, to oreate a permaneni and immediate poetry. For the poet reduces himself to an intermediate status somewhere between a vocal chord and an Aeolian harp. By ""getting rid of the lyrical interference of the individual as ego"" (the phrase is Mr. Olson's), the poet is likely to get rid of his poetry as well. At the best, he scales down his poem to a miniature, even though its verbiage drags over several pages.
What we have reached, then, is a regression to the cult of the "" amusing "". This lethal word has been applied, during the past 30 years, to one art after another. From ballet to interior decoration, from the Parisian music of 1920 to objets 1routves, clever people in search of high fashion have turned amusing. Often they conceal their purpose under a plausible disguise: fashion, after all, is at its most ""amusing"" when it is deeply serious. But what they produce bears the same relation to the central themes of each art as the hobble-skirt or M. Darius Milhaud's choice of a seedsman's catalogue as libretto for a choral work.
It is easy to be amused, in this sense. by the new American poetry-which, incidentally, leaves out of account most American poetry that is new in the true sense of the word. But it will be a sad thing if the greater part of what may loosely be called Beat poetry is taken for anything other than what it is: a brittle echo from the Boulevards of many years ago. It avoids the bloodless decorum which inhibits much of our own new poetry. It calls a spade some very curious names indeed, and perhaps imparts a momentary thrill to the innocent thereby. But the total result on the reader is an emotion which is less Beat than dead tired. The effective reaction against formal sweetness in poetry took place nearly half a century ago, and no fresh show of indignation can disguise that fact. What poetry needs today, on both sides of the Atlantic, is less preoccupation with form as an extension of content, and greater preoccupation with memorable form as a clothing for memorable content.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS252010287/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=e4e64618

FROM OUR MUSIC CRITIC
That art is one, that all the arts are the same kind of phenomenon, is axiomatic with artists, philosophers and plain men. A Society of Aesthetics'has recently been formed in London to focus discussion on the special character of what used to be known as the Sublime and Beautiful. An international conference is sbortly to be held in Athens to pursue further such fundamental questions as whether art needs be beautiful and whether natural beauty is the same sort of thing as the beautiful in art. Sir Herbert Read touched on a few Of such topics in an inaugural address L.iven to the British Society of Aesthetics early this month and allowed that some tnodern art was not beautifil but' was -what ? vital ? true ? significant ? Philosophers have debated such questions from Plato onwards but have tended to regard them as secondary to logic and ethics, though Aristotle, excellent fellow, wrote a Poetics as well as an Ethics and a Politics. With English philosophy in its present state of abniegation of systems aesthetics has as a matter of fact come in for a good deal more attention than heretofore-otherwise surely no one would have thought of founding a society to focus it
NO SUCH THING AS ART
At one fairly recent symposium devoted to the philosophy of art at Downside a speaker from Oxford came out bluntly with the view that art was not one, that there was no such thing as Art but only arts. Shocking as such a -view is, one begins to flirt with it at the practical level. Try to organize a festival of the arts and you can have a gorgeous time putting in all the things you like best and inviting the world to join you in'enjoying them. Realizing that the unity of your festival is only the unity of your individual taste without any sort of universal validity you decide to concentrate on a period and so achieve unity of time. But then you find the arts do not move in parallel: music is centuries out with painting and literary developments correspond with neither, though Curt Sachs wrote an unconvincing book to show that the Zeitgeist controls them all, and modernism at the moment shows a geater degree of similarity than usual in that all the arts tend to unintelligibility, i.e.. to be based on an aesthetic of construction rather than of communication. And supposing you got your arts lined up by unity of time and spirit they would jump apart according to divisions of language and nationality.
Yet at the practical level promoters of festivals are arranging their programmes to cover wider and wider fields of artistic experience. King's Lynn, though a small festival, has an enormous spread: ballet and jazz rub shoulders with song recitals and chamber music; the sense of hearing is complemented by the sense of taste, though wine and cheese do not add up to fine art; drama is in attendance with painting and the visitor can ask himself at the end of a week whether he thinks his varied experiences have been fundamentally the same in kind. He may say yes to that but still be in doubt about the comtnon element, unless it be the exercise of sensibiliRy.
The question is posed more acutely still by the activities of the Apollo Society. Someone had a good idea that on the analogy of the song recital poetry could be declaimed, and as songs and piano solos have been partners for a century and a half,
the piano should bo invited to break up too long stretches of the spoken word. Surely it would be easy to intersperse congruent morceaux among lyric poems, ballades perhaps among ballads and, improbably, a few curiosities of piano literature among parodies. Mr. John Betieman had dug out a wonderful old Victorian galop, "" Oui vive "" for piano duet, which was played on Tuesday in a programme of poetry and music that gave great pleasure but absolutely defied aesthetic justification-its unity, we all suspected, was simply Mr. BetIernan's highly idiosyncratic taste. This echo from a hundred hunt-balls was funny in itself-after all the Victorians were fullblooded and high spirited people and they would dance to it with wild hilarity; it was funny as a period piece; and it was musically ludicrous, so that it set the mood for a group of parodies. But no more at this recital than at other meetings of the Apollo Society was it apparent on what principles, if any, piano music can be chosen to match lyric poems.
Music and poetry can come to terms in song, for, with some surrender of sovereignty by both arts, a new work of art combining the expressive powers of both can be created, the poem having to do the conceptual part of the business, the music the evocative, but each serving the other, the poem as starting Point, the music as ultimate issue. But Schumann's piano pieces will not really go with English Poems, even if the moods and the dates are the same, for they are too Gennan and too lushly romantic; nor will Debussy who is too French-or would he pair off with Dante Gabriel Rosetti ?
ENJOYABLE VARIETY
What in fact makes such mixed recitals and such festivals enjoyable is their variety. The festivals have something for everybody. If, as in a place like Bath, the eighteenth century stares you in the face, you can make your programme congruous therewith and so provide an extra shock of pleasure at the recognition of the congruity-it was so with Handel at Hollkham Hall the other afternoon. But the Apollo Society's recitals always leave behind among their pleasure a disturbing feeling that there is something a bit wrong with the mixture. It is not that more music is required: not at all, music is a good servant-witness its service to the church, the theatre and the dance-hall-and is quite ready to take second place and provide relief. The problem is congruitywhat will go with what ? Let the process of trial and error go on by all means, but let the aestheticians turn their attention to it and see if they can discover underlying Principles of choice in mixing the arts. Here is something for the agenda of the Athens conference.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS218324733/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=5af9a81a

TALKING OF BOOKS
By George Cloyne
Mr. Donald Hall, in a recent nuum ber of Tile New York Times Book Review, has some salutary things to say about the state of poetry in England today. His main contention amounts to this: that ""the best poetry of the modern world has involved sophistication, cosmopolitanism, and deliberate ambition "". He then sadly comments that "" the best young writers of England have resigned from this nmodern world "". This is because they have, in his view, taken refuge in regionalism, in the kind of committed attitude wihich sets a hatred of social pretence above considerations of technique and devotion, and because they cultivate a domestic modesty (hostile to any but minor poetry.
It was time for this to be said. Mr. Hall is not merely dismissive. He concedes our part of natural honesty, a taste for critical argurment, and the gift of observation. But these are attributes which lead towards some deolicate object carved out of a walnut-shell, rather than to the permanence of granite. It remains that the imagination today is curiously hostile to any manifestation which enlarges its scope. It prefers to dance, like an angel, on the point of a pin.
Not only so, but it resents the spirit of enterprise in others. I suppose that when the course of poetry in the last generation is finally mapped and indexed, the names most -likely to recur are these of Mr. Pound and Mr. Eliot, flaanked by such contempoararies as Dame Edith Sitwell, and followed by the decade of Mr. Auden and Mr. Spender. A little later comes Dylan Thomas, and after that a lullX in which talents appear, flicker like marsh-lights, and one by one turn to other avocations.
This is an unfair judgmen,t-just as Mr. Hall's dismissal of the Georgian poets is unfair. There are excellent poets now writing-Mr. George Barker is an obvious examnple in one generation, and Mr. Ted Hughes in another-who a-re by no means to be dismissed as vwill-ofthe-wisps. But fame writes her poge with an uncertain finger. This writer or that is accepted as the leader of a period, while to a third a label is pinned which has no connexion with his intention.
The sum of the matter is that critical standards alter every 20 years or so, -with the effect that most of the elder writers Whom Ihave named are set, by general opinion. in a sunset glow. They may be acclaimed or reviled, but I am not sure they are much read. And this, not because they are out of touch with the main-stream of poetry, not because they are difficult, but because they are all vaulting poets with some inaccessible target before their eyes, whereas the younger writers who have made a name for themselves sinee 1939 are generally scornful of targets, unless they are solely political or social.
If whrat remains is a very buttoned-up sort of poetry the fault is partly with readers rather than writers. For some years now it has been an axiom that readers are very easily tired. Having grappled with the complexities of Ulysses and The Waste Land they are (or so the argument runs) exhausted. All they ask is a slow return to the mellifluous evocations or stanzas of the nineteenth century. Indeed, Mr. Hall's point of departure is a young woman in Essex, Who, when she learnt that he was a poet, had nothing better to say than "" Uh .. . what sort ? The straightforward kind ? ""
We are always being told that poetry has at last become simÂ¶ple once more, as though simplicity were automatically a virtue. But the truth is that readers are more discriminating than they are supposed to be. It is not simplicity they look for but merit. The only readers who restrict their pleasure to simple poetry are those who have no genuine interest in the subject at all. They are like visitors to France who cannot be bothered with a suce, and com,plain because they do not get their tea. They may respect habit, but they are not concerned with principles.
The world, nevertheless, is Xull of readers who care intensely about poetry. They seek in it not an opiate but a stimulus. It nmight be thought, therefore, that the poets would answer better to their vast new audience; that they would feel a burden of responsibility in the fact that poetry has stretched its frontiers to include anybody capable of thought and feeling. Somehow. however, they have lagged behind. If they are conscious of a political commitment they are likely to put it in the forefront of their verse. If they have no commitment they will take refuge in charm, or wit, or erudition. That is why I am glad Mr. Hall has spoken his mind. For neither charm. nor wit, nor erudition suffices without the extra gift of having something to say.
The poverty of communication in poetry seems to go in direct ratio to the amount of it available. When, as in the age of Dryden, any civilized gentleman might also be a poet, there was a completo identificatioa of the poet with the Zeitgeist. He wrote what his period required of him, and in the necessary manner. Nowadays, poets are obsessed by their own independence. Now, the poet first assumes a bardic mantle and then wears it like a beaoh-towel. I am sure Mr. Donald Hall is right in condemning the mediocre notion of the function of poetry entertained by some of our good younger poets. Only when they link their verse to the core, rather than the surface, of contemporary life wil their readers turn to them for the authority which they have inherited from Coleridge and Matthew Arnold.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS252010229/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=fa144130

At the turn of the year poetry reaches a wider public than at any other time, if only because we are more conscious then of the legacy from which much of our lyric poetry springs: the carols whose simplicity enfolds some of the most magical stanzas in English. Christrmas, far more than the other ecclesiastical seasons of the year, is intimnately associated with poetry, and an extremely intelligent book of essays by an Australian poet, Mr. James McAuley, may e:~plain why.
The book is called The E id of Modernity,and its contention is that something has gone badly wrong with the arts since they lost their spontaneous and easy contact with metaphysicssince they became almost as a matter of course self-regarding. Mr. McAuley's argument is exemplified in many contexts, but one in particular has held 'ry attention: he notices that under strong inspiration the mind tends to "" lay hold on the ancient symbols by which men once understood who thzey are."" This, he suggests, leads to a tug of war between the fashionable attitude of the moment and the spontaneous tendencies of the heart; and he concludes that from this struggle comes much of the obscurity which has made modem readers fight shy of poetry.
I have been trying to assess the value of this in the field where it is most clearly applicable: that of religious poetry. It is noticeable that, of early poems, such as "" Quia amore langueo "" or "" Of a rose, a lovely rose,"" nearly aU are anonymous. These exquisite lines speak with the voice of the whole human race: they are as universal to the society which made them as the paintings in a Book of Hours or the stone ribs of a cathedral. There is no reason why any single artificer should claim them for his own, and yet to show the extraordinary variety which can be put into this disembodied verse no more is needed than a glance through the opening pages of Dame Edith Sitwell's recent Atlantic Book of British and Amnerican Poetry.
The change came slowly, as religious poetry moved away from a Virgilian innocence towards the personal dilemmas of the Reformation. No doubt it is easy to exaggerate that innocence. Just as Florentine art preserves the balance and the colour of the Renaissance so beautifully that we forget the violence and the tyrannies of that cruellest of cities, so what remains to us of the Middle Ages is all peace, all order (unless it is aU anathema); we do not look far below
the surface. But by the end of the skiteenth century a startling change had occurred in religious poetry. With the greatest of all our religious poets, Donne, we find ourselves suddenly hand in hand. His moments of vision and of torment might flash up from the world of to-day, but for one thing: in Mr. McAuley's phrase, ""he understood who he was"" -an understanding shared by Herrick and George Herbert, by Vaughan, Traherne, and Milton.
After the coming of the eighteenth century, to understand who one wasin the McAuley sense of keeping a proportion between man and infinitybecame very much more difficult. It was soon involved, if not with madness outright, at least with paranoia. Neither of Blake nor Smart, not even of Coleridge, could it be said that they were at ase within the framework of their intellect. The innocence of the Middle Ages had gone for ever, and the shifting certainties of Progress had not yet taken their place. Where the old religious poetry had been serene, or, later, activist in an attempt to regain serenity, the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries treated their religion as moths treat the lamp: wings fluttered against the burning possibility of a certainty until they scorched in the flame.
And since then religious poetry has never been at ease. Either it is doggedly pietistic, or rhapsodical after a fitful fashion, or tied up in the knots of a hard-won technique. Even those who have transcended these limitationsHopkins, say, or Dame Edith herself -have been 'unable to move with equal tact among religious and secular themes. The simplicity which marks the very best religious poetry has been obscured by an obnubilation of sheer skill. Indeed, of all living religious poets I can only think of Dame Edith who offers her subject the supreme courtesy of not changing her tone when she turns from purely secular poetry to the mood of "" Still Fals the Rain.""
We are a long way by now from the early carols, and so conscious of our own striving egos that we can never expect to touch utter natural simplicity again. A story is told of Lord Berners, to whom a woman friend of some social consequence was complaining that she had had difficulty in getting a table in a nightclub. "" But of course,"" she said, "" when I told them who I was it was all right."" ""And who were you?"" asked Lord Berners. It is a question of general applicability.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS252010030/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=e3105428

Null,Masefield's New Epic: The Story of Ossian,The Times,1959-Apr-23,"London, England","Masefield's New Epic: The
Story of Ossian
At the age of 81 Dr. John Masefield, the Poet Laureate. has made a revolutionary gesture in the cause of spoken poetry by presenting a new large-scale work to the public in the form of a gramophone record.
""The Story of Ossian,"" an epic poem based on the body of Irish legend surrounding Finn MacCoul and his son Ossian, has been recorded by the author under the auspices of the Academy of American Poets and is released in this country by Argo (RG 178, price Â£1 19s. 9d.). The work lasts over an hour, and it is doubtful whether any other living English poet (with the possible exception of Mr. Andrew Young) could have renounced print on such a heroic scale. The long poem is not a favourite exercise of modem poets, and those who do attempt it tend to avoid putting their stamina to the test of continuous narrative. It is precisely Dr. Masefield's mastery of clear-cut energetic narrative that enables him to command unbroken aural attention.
SYMPHONIC AFFINITIES
The poem is in three parts: it begins and ends as a boldly delivered tale, framing a central passage of unearthly lyricism. This spacious design has obvious symphonic affinities. and the vigorous realism of the first section is organically related to the rarefied atmosphere of the second. The legends on which the poem is based, besides giving the poet an opPOrtUnity to exercise his gfts as a stor-teller and to re-invoke the romantic landscape that recurs constantly in his past writings, also furnish a hero whom the author can use as his own spokesman.
Finn, an old warrior-king, has set his heart on marrying the daughter of Cormac, a neighbouring chieftain. He dispatches his two sons to woo for him: on tbe way they are met by Niamh. a radiant creature who warns them that the marriage may end in disaster. but promises Ossian that if it does he will escape with her from the earth. The marriage does lead to internecine carnage, and Finn's supporters at the end of their tether are met again by Niamb who places Ossian on horseback and leads him up to the sky. There he lives in a state of timeless ecstasy passing through cities "" built in beauty's praise by deathless beings:' and contemplating all the variety of nature.
Then he returns to earth and finds that he has been away three centuries, and that he has become ""an old, bent, broken thing . . . a worn-out coin, too battered to be spent."" The Poignancy of this return is softened at the end when Niamh, too, comes back to earth to release him from his body.
VAGUE ROMANTIC VALUES
This account, though it conveys nothing of the poem's expressive qualities, does emphasize its main flaw-the vagueness of its romantic values. Ossian's sojourn in the eternal regions is intended as a vision of ineffable harmony between man and nature. Perhaps such a vision can be approached only in veiled emotive language; but Dr. Masefield fails to evoke it even in that way. His cities with their speaking weathercocks, his remorseless reiterations of the word ""beauty,"" his rapid and exotic changes of scenery, are directly reminiscent of The Box of Delights. In that otherwise delightful children's book Dr. Masefield so saturated the reader in marvels that one dreaded the moment at which little Kay would reopen the magic box and embark on yet another conducted tour of the land of fancy.
In ""The Story of Ossian"" it is plain that the romantic vision is not intended as a delusion, for the hero is reunited with it at the end. But this resolution is a hollow formality compared with the stark desolate poetry Ossian speaks as an old man, ""lost, unreal, evil, dim,"" inconsolably grieving for the dreams that wasted away his youth.
POET'S SENSITIVE READING On the page ""The StorY of Ossian "" would probably look monotonous: it is written in regular iambs, the ABAB rhyme scheme periodically contracting into couplets to secure emphasis. But there is great flexibility in the handling of this simple pattern, and the author's reading follows its nuances with absolute sensitivity. The voice is fastidious, firm and musical, its dynamics may be narrow, but its expressive range is vast.
As a companion disc Argo have issued two readings by Mr. E. M. Forster (RG 153). On this record Mr. Forster, in a dry youthful voice, can be heard reading his story ""The Road from Colonus "" and his essay ""What I believe."" Introducing the second piece. Mr. Forster states that since it was written during the war some of his opinions may have been modified: but he has allowed the text to stand. ""I don't believe an author has any right to tamper with his text.""",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS101670039/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=efa770f4

MATTHEW GREEN
by Olver Edwards
When Dr. Johnson has said of a poet's solitary claim to fame that the work is not poetry that should be the end of hirn. Yet just as the Doctor himself found it useful to quote to Boswell on a later occasion two lines from this same poem in order to reinforce a point, so through over two hundred years the name of Matthew Green, its author, has held on, cropping up here and there in each generation, tenaciously refusing to be forgotten.
For one thing, browsers in Tlhe Dictionary of National Biographly-that "" best record of a nation's past that any civilization has produced,"" as Professor G. M. Trevelyan has rightly called itwill from time to time come across the entry on Green and at once know they are in the presence of a real person. Under 300 words in length, it is one of those tiny masterpieces which Leslie Stephen could do so admirably, and which get to the heart of his subject much more successfully than do his longer essays. He tells us that Matthew Green (1696-1737) held a place in the custom-house. Bureaucracy was then very much as it is now, for officialdom decreed an economy measure that the allowance for supplying the customhouse cats with milk must be withdrawn. Green, says Stephen, petitioned the authorities in their name-and won.
The details of his other story about Green may not be strictly accurate but the gist is the same in the differing versions. Stephen records that ""When a waterman insulted him as he was bathing by calling out Quaker, and a friend asked how his sect could be detected when he had no clothes, he immediately replied, 'By my swimming against the stream.'"" An earlier version of the episode has it that it was one Sylvanus Bevan who was impertinently addressed by the waterman, and that it was upon his meeting Green, and expressing surprise to him, that Green delivered himself of the epigram. Either way the wit was his. What importance there is in the discrepancy lies in the fact that while Green came from a family of dissenters, there is no evidence that he was a Quaker. His poetry discounts the idea.
That poetry consists of only some five or six works and, in effect, like ""Shipwreck Falconer,"" Green is the author of only one poem that matters. The Spleen. An Epistle Inscribed to his particular FRIEND Mr. C. J. was written in the last years of Green's short life, and the first edition ""Printed and sold by A. Dodd, without Temple-Bar and at all the Pamphlet Shops in Town "" was published posthumously. Mr. Dodd was obviously a loving craftsman and in justice to his memory let it be recorded the poem was printed handsomely. They knew the value of large type, good black ink, and the proper placing of the text upon the page, in 1737.
There is another person to whom tribute is due and that is Mr. C. J. He was Cuthbert Jackson, one of those friends for whose entertainment Green,
a most assiduous minor official, used to produce in his leisure hours jertx d'esprit in prose and verse. When Jackson first received the epistle "" it was quite short."" Knowing a good thing when he saw one he persuaded Green to fill it out. Even then, however, there was no idea of publication. That was left to Glover, another of Green's friends. Between them, Jackson and Glover made sure the custom-house man should have his tiny niche in the great hall of British poets.
In spite of Dr. Johnson it is deserved. Green still has his admirers. One friend to whom I mentioned his name the other day, at once began to recite
Laugh and be well. Monkeys have been Extreme good doctors for the Spleen; And kitten, if the humour hit, Has harlequin'd away the fit.
We can, moreover, in this matter set up one good Tory against another. George Saintsbury described The Spleen as "" one of the liveliest poems of a century which has produced many lively poems."" Saintsbury also said it was ""a little Philistine and decidedly hedonist."" There are times, indeed, when it rcminds us of Omar Khayyam.
Me never did ambition seize,
Strange fever, most inflam'd by ease ! The active lunacy of pride,
That courts jilt Fortune for a bride ... Reforming schemes are none of mine: To mend the world's a vast design: Like theirs, who tug in little boat, To pull to them the ship afloat Happy the man, who, innocent
Grieves not at ills he can't prevent.
Green himself is said to have suffered from the spleen. If that were so, most successfully did he overcome it. It has been pointed out that his poem is really a poetical paraphrase of Dr. Cheyne's treatise on "" Low Spirits,"" a chapter in "" The English Malady,"" published in 1733. But Green's experience and fancy took the cures much wider. Hunting, and bowls, music, the theatre-there are few solaces to which he caninot turn. And his final dream of content is one of those simple rusticities which strike a note in everyone.
Two hundred pounds, half-yearly paid, Annuity securely made,
A farm some twenty miles from town, Small, tight, salubrious, and my own. Two maids that never saw the town, A serving man not quite a clown, A boy to help to tread the mow,
And drive, while t'other holds the
plough. May heaven (it's all I wish for) send One genial room to treat a friend,
Where decent cup-board, little plate, Display benevolence, not state.
And may my humble dwelling stand Upon some chosen spot of land: A pond before full to the brim,
Where cows may cool and geese may swim; Behind a green, like velvet neat, Soft to the eye and to the feet;
Where odorous plants, in evening fair,
Breathe all around ambrosial air . . .
And so it goes on, deceptively easy except to those poets who have tried to do it. ""Never did a man of genius"" one admirer wrote of Green over a hundred years ago, "" leave fainter marks of his footsteps upon life."" None the less his work falls on the ear and his character upon the mind pleasantly, even in these vastly different days.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS184900373/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=febe1ed9

FROM A CORRESPONDENT
JUPITER RECORDINGS LTD. is a
new company which has been founded for the particular purpose of recording English poetry. So far it has issued two discs-the first part of an anthology of twentieth-century poetry (JUR OOAI, price 39s.), and the first part of a junior anthology of English verse (JUR OOBI, price 29s.).
The first disc bristles with battered old favourites such as W. H. DavieÂ§'s ""Leisure"" and Fleckeer's ""Old Ships,"" and conveys the innocuous impression of a set of writers given mainly to whimsicality and bucolic rufnination.
The readers are Miss Jill Balcon, Mr. John Glen, Mr. Christopher Hassall, Mr. Carleton Hobbs, Mr. C. Day Lewis, and Mr. Stephen Murray. This list is misleading if it suggests variety. for the recording is overwhelmingly the work of its director, Mr. V. C. Clinton-Baddeley. Wbereas Miss Balcon and Mr. Day Lewis, for instance, are allowed one brief poem each, Mr. Clinton-Baddeley reads 17. His reading inclines towards excessive resonance which overloads some of the slighter lyrics and falls short of the bardic weight demanded by poems such as Hardy's ""An Ancient to Ancients"" and Yeats's ""The Second Coming."" The most satisfying readings'on the disc are of poems written in a relaxed conversational idiom.
Virtuoso Reading
At the end, like a baroque firework, Dame Edith Sitwell soars extravagantly aloft. Her performance, of three of her own poems, is that of a virtuoso attacking the most hair-raisingly difficult and musically worthless of concert studies. Meaning is ignored, words being treated entirely for their value as sound and for their place within intricate rhythnic schemes: and while the heady voluptuousness of ""Most Lovely Shade"" and the compressed ironies of two pieces from "" Facade "" do emerge, they remain severely detached from the flowing cantabile and staccato brilliance of the voice.
The junior anthology, less ambitious though it is, seems a more satisfactory undertaking. Unlike the twentieth century anthology it has a distinct audience in mind. and is well designed to awaken a taste for verse. Lyrics stay well within the boundaries of childhood experience, ballads and narrative poems predominate, and, with the exception of a mawkish piece by Ralph Hodgson. there are no duds.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS69557008/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=f9f22bf6

OSBERT SrrwELL: On the Continent.
It is 40 years, he tells us, since Sir Osbert Sitwell planned a trilogy which is now completed by On the Continent. The previous volumes, England Reclaimed and Wrack- at Tidesend, successfully evoked a pastoral and a sea-side mood respectively, by means of a set of portraits in free verse. The present collection deals with expatriates""inquilines,"" Sir Osbert calls them-and thus a very private wing has been added to the National Portrait Gallery, consisting entirely of pen-sketches of non-notabilities in the period immediately before the First World War.
Sir Osbert has always excelled in the art of the written portrait, and there is a salutary exercise for those who may complain that the form of verse he has chosen is too loose in structure and rhythm: they can try to do half so well themselves. The whole series of poems is, in fact, very carefully composed. If the first volume reflected, with due poetic permutations, the world which revolved round Sir Osbert's Derbyshire home, and the second that of his father's other house at Scarborough, On the Continent must be linked to the Tuscan castle of which he has already written in prose. Thus the trilogy makes a poetic commentary on the early sections of his autobiography; the personages it commemorates are put forwvard with the fantasy and charm of statues in a rocaille setting and, for those old enough to remember the social historY of Florence a generation and more ago, there will be the additional amusement of catching a hint, here and there of the living eccentrics who once peopled that extravagant colony of inquilines.
The poems themselves are full of admirable touches, "" Her square face like an unfinished game of noughts and crosses,""
her loaf of white hair"" ""a dry and abstract wig."" Sir Osbert: it will be seen, is generally astringent about the human subjects of his poems, reserving his considerable tenderness and skill of sympathetic evocation for landscape, or-if humans must intrude-for very simple folk The themes of the book are bound together

AND SING
Nine volumes, of which six are first collections. Nine volumes which are far from exhausting the list of poetry published during the past few weeks. It can be said, therefore, that although poets are commonly, and rightly,, said to labour under general discouragement in a materialist world, they have remained obstinately articulate. Furthermore, all nine of these volumes are interesting, and some much more. than that. Where they fail is almost always at the same point. There is a constant tendency in modem poetry for the poem to turn into a thumbnail essay in verse. No poetic experience is communicated, yet some superstructure of verse has been added to what is essentially a prose train of thought. The result is as far as possible from the theory of poetry put forward explictly by Mallarme and Valery and adopted more or less tacitly by most of the successful poets writing in English during the past 40 years. And often it is extremely difficult to read.
Warning may be given by a title. Southey at Grasmere,"" "" On reading Epictetus,"" *' Thoughts in a Lady Chapel ""; such themes-invented at random-recur in book after book, indicating that a sequence of ideas has been set in motion, cultivated ideas. novel even, and certainly "" literary "" in the extreme. Yet communication is at the wrong level. Everything is packed into the poem except poetry.
There are, of course, exceptions to this generalizat:on; but it is noticeable that most of the poets here named approach poetry in a somewhat wry and diminished frame of mind. Much the most accomplished is Mr. Roy Fuller, who uses a dark skill on the intricacies of the world around him. Yet for the sudden true-sounding note of poetry it may be wiser to turn to the much more uneven book of Mr. Brian G:les-a poet hitherto only known from occasional appearances in periodicals, yet capable of an authority which deserves immediate acclaim. Two other first collections in this list must also be picked out: that of Mr. Quentin Stevenson, a true and moving poet at present weighed down with a certain amount of cumbersome equipment, but paring his learned art, at times. to a moving simplicity; and a little book by Mr. Dom Moraes, a writer not yet 20, whose start is a strikingly auspicious one.
Mr. Ted Hughes is already known on both sides of the Atlantic, and his book is the choice of the Poetry Book Society. It is marked by brilliance and variety, and in these qualities it matches Mr. Donald Davie's A Winter Talent. In both, however, the impression left behind is of a highly articulate writer casting his thought into a mould of verse without noticing that much of it is only an alembicated form of prose. By comparison, the greatei simplicity of Mr. Anthony Cronin and Mi. Twbwaite gain. They content themselves with lucid, agreeable statements in verse. well turned and kept deliberately low in tone. And last there is Mr. Christopher Hassall, who remains an entirely pleasurable poet. He can be witty, or sentimental. or evocative as he pleases; he is also an admirable technician. If there is a slight feeling of disappointment hanging over The Red Leaf it is because Mr. Hassall has not been more ambitious. He only does what he can do well and easily, and
he contents himself with too relaxed a verse structure whenever he uses a long line.
In fine, then, the poets have plenty to offer, and even when they set a wall of other people's books between themselves and real life their responses are never slack. It remains for most of them, however, to reconsider the important distinction between writing poetry and translating short sequences of prose thought into verse.

OF A PUBLIC
There are many objections to be made to the poetry of any age, but usually they can be reduced to two main categories: the absence of authority, and the absence of an individual voice. A number of poets have lately given opportunity to test this generalization, and it must be confessed that all too often they induce a degree of weariness in the reader. Their pages are beautifully set; their stanzas are shapely and the movements of their fancy brisk. But somehow the poem itself turns too often into something like the object which falls from a Christmas cracker-at first sight inexplicable, then quite amusing, and finally dropped on the table without another thought.
There are exceptions, however. Those who remember The Winter House of over 20 years ago will certainly be delighted by the Collected Poems of Norman Cameron, to which Mr. Robert Graves has added an exemplary introduction. The merits of these poems can be indicated by quoting in full the shortest of them:
Forgive me, Sire, for cheating your intent, That 1, who should command a regiment, Do amble amniably here, 0 God,
One of the neat ones in your awkward
squad. Cameron assessed himself as a part-time poet, but this volume makes it clear that, within his fastidious range, he was one who will not be forgotten. Clear, decisive, idiosyncratic without being self-consciously odd, his poems are not among those easily laid aside. Nor are the best of Mr. George Barker's; and among those best must be accounted the autobiographical True Confession, one of the few really impressive long poems of our time. Mr. Barker is very uneven, but his collection covering 25 years shows at its best an incandescencewhich can warm as well as dazzle.
The other poets listed below fall into groups: There are those who continue an expected path like Mr. Day Lewis and Mr. MacNeice-the one mainly elegiac, the other lit by an uneasy brilliance w-hich
seems on the verge of breaking into something new without ever quite doing so. There are the poets of the future, Mr. Bus Singer and Mr. Thom Gunn, whose newness of vision has still to be tested by time. There are two voices from America, Mr. Wilbur and Mr. Eberhart-both worth hearing, though both are rather too prolix. And there are three outriders: Mr. Kirkup, who has put together a rather unsatisfying mixture of the very good and the very disappointing; Mr. MacCaig, who adds to his range a deeper insight than in Riding Lights, and shows himself among the best of contemporary Scottish poets; and Mr. Mackintosh, who once again shows that he is among the few modem writers of light verse who can be named in the same breath as the acknowledged masters.
All of these deserve something better than a mere mention. It would be easy to expatiate on Mr. Singer's really striking use of extended forms-he is a poet who needs .space-on Mr. Kirkup's unexpected and delightful visions-"" The Convenience "" is an example-on Mr. Wilbur's airy accomp lishment or Mr. Gunn's more sombre
licities. All in all, in fact,thishasbeen a good season for poetry.

"Edwards, Oliver",Peacock As A Poet,The Times,1957-Jul-04,"London, England","TALKING OF BOOKS
PEACOCK AS
A POET
By Oliver Edwards
Mention Thomas Love Peacock as a poet and the likelihood is that at once souieone will pipe up with
The mountain sheep are sweeter But the valley sheep are fatter
But that, it may be -objected, is a song. Peacock himself declared it to be "" The War Song of Dinas Vawr.' While no one would wish to challenge Peacock as a writer of songs, above all of drinking songs, is not poetry another matter ?
I would like to leave that issue on one side for the moment. We can get along without settling it because we can, I think, get along-for the purpose of the argument-almost without the songs; certainly without the drinking songs. This may surprise readers who know Peacock only in his novels, and for whom such rollicking affairs as "" A heeltap ! a heeltap ! I never could bear it ! "" "" If I drink water while this doth last"" and the glorious ""Hail to the hieadlong! "", falling naturally into the general fantastication of the plot and setting, have over-shadowed the beauties of the quieter lyrics. The emphasis was strengthened some years ago by a pleasant little volume, Drinking Songs from Peacock's Novels. Here wvas obviously a festive, jovial, jingling old gentleman, a bit of a genius in his queer way. But a poet ? Or else, at the other extreme, people may have come across an equally slender volume, Rhododaphne. That, they may have felt, settled Peacock's poetical pretensions once for all.
The fact is that "" Poems "" and "" Poems and Plays"" fill two volumes out of the 10 in the Halliford edition of Peacock's works. Much handier is the book of Peacock's poetry Brimley Johnson compiled for Routledge's "" Muses' Library "" 50 years ago. The odd copy is still to be found in the second-hand shops and I commend it to anyone who comes across it there. Brimley Johnson was one of the Honest Dobbins of the book world. He had taste and judgment; he was careful and conscientious. In this companionable, pocketable - for those who have the right kind of bookmen's pockets-volume of over 400 pages, his work must have given pleasure here and there through two generations.
Sheer bulk cannot, of course, make a poet. Nor does one need to accompany Saintsbury all the way in the opposite direction when he chants:
The laughing Queen that caught the world's great hands
and proclaims that, because of that one wonderful line and despite "" volumes of triviality and vulgarity and sentimental gush,"" Leigh Hunt was indubitably a poet. Peacock has no need of either of these props. He has no ""jewelled phrases five words long."" And, with one exception, his long poems can be left to the devoted. One has to have a real affection for Peacock to find enchantment in "" Palmyra,"" "" Rhododaphne,"" or ""Fiolfar, King of Norway.""
- Peacock wrote poetry from boyhood on. By twenty-one he had produced a respectable amount of apprentice work. But it was two or three years later, some time after 1808, that he struck an assured note in ""Remember Me.""
And what are life's enchanting dreams, That melt like morning mists away ?
And what are Fancy's golden beams, That glow with transitory day ?
While adverse stars my steps impel,
To climes remote, my love, from thee, Will that dear breast with pity swell And wilt thou still remember me ?
There are eight verses, and I wish I could recite them all.
It may be objected that even this is precious near a song. Listen, then, to "" The Grave of Love,"" which Earle Welby found so "" inexplicably beautiful.""
I dug, beneath the cypress shade,
What well might seem an eHin's graye And every pledge in earth I laid,e That erst thy false affection gave.
I pressed them down the sod beneath; I placed one mossy stone above;
And twined the rose's fading wreath Around the sepulchre of love.
Frail as thy love, the flowers were dead 'Ere yet the evening sun was set;
But years shall see the cypress spread, Irnmutable as my regret.
Or read that lovely lament, ""Long night succeeds thy little day,"" which Peacock wrote on the death of his threeyear-old child, Margaret. Or pick up Gryll Grange-pick it up in any caseturn to chapter XV and find "" Youth and Age.""
I played with you 'mid cowslips blowing When I was six and you were-four;
When garlands weaving, flower-bells
throwing, Were pleasures soon to please no more. Through groves and meads, o'er grass
and heather, With little playmates, to and fro,
We wandered hand in hand together But that was sixty years ago.
If you do not read on, then I have failed to make my case.
The Devil's advocate never suffering unemployment, there may still be objections that these are small cargo for immortality. I would not agree but, as the lawyers say, even if I did, I would claim that many of the songs in the novels are poetry. (If songs are not poetry what becomes of Robert Burns ?) Were this not enough I would summon up the one exception among the longer poems. "" The Genius of the Thames "" is, to me, one of the best things that majestic stream has inspired. Starting with the description of an autumn night on its banks, Peacock tells the story of its long history, takes the reader down its course, and then, hearing music at Richmond, reflects on those once great empires through which the Euphrates and the Tiber flowed.
Time, the foe of man's dominion,
Wheels around in ceaseless flight, Scattering from his hoary pinion Shades of everlasting night.
Still, beneath his frown appalling, Man and all his works decay:
Still, before him, swiftly-falling,
Kings and kingdoms pass away.
Cannot the hand of patriot zeal,
The heart that seeks the public weal,
The comprehensive mind
Retard awhile the stormns of fate,
That, swift or slow, or soon or late, Shall hurl to ruin every state.
And leave no trace behind ?
The first time I heard those lines was in the school chapel when, instead of the usual sermon, the closing verses of "" The Genius of the Thames"" were read to us. I was at an impressionable age and they moved me deeply. But I do not think it is merely recollected emotion that convinces me Peacock was a poet.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS218847460/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=a73ba28e

DAME EDITH SrIWELL ON
A LIVING ART
In a talk on poetry given in London yesterday Dame Edith Sitwell had sorme kind words to say for a few young poets writing to-day and some sharp ones -for
the host of inferior versifiers."" Nor did critics of poetry escape her rebukes.
Dame Edith Sitwell, who was delivering the Hermon Ould memorial lecture organized by the English centre of International P.E.N., said that one of the troubles with a great many younger poets was that "" they have not the faintest idea how to use consonants, with the result that their verse sounds numb, flat, and dead."" Grandeur could not be obtained without a skilful use of consonantal systems.
Lack of technique was another failure of many poets of to-day. "" They write in lifeless quatrains, or else produce attempts at geometrical designs so easy to manage that any schoolboy could do so, and which have the cramped dimensions of prefabricated houses."" Such methods. Dame Edith Sitwell suggested, had replaced the ""flabby, so-called free verse which was previously fashionable among incompetent versifiers."" This was actually bad prose cut into uneven lengths with blunt scissors.
FREE VERSE DIFFICULTIES
The lecture was rich in quotations to sharpen the argument, and at this point Dame Edith Sitwell quoted:-
For time is up, you have upset the table. Time is up, your red trousers are burntTime is up, the- wireless is smashed. Oh, helpless now, I see This-is reality.
""Well,"" grimly remarked the lecturer, ""if that is reality that is just too bad ! In fact, free verse was appallingly difficult to manage. She asked her audience to listen to the "" melodic beauty "" of a master of the medium: -
Such are the clouds
They float with white coolness and sunny
shade
Sometimes preening their flightless
feathers.
Float, proud swans, on the calm lake And wave your clipped wings in the-azure
air-.- -
Gather new coolness for to-morrow's beat And sleep through the soft night with
folded wing.
A further danger inherent in much verse by younger writers was due to their misunderstanding of the uses of concentration, or "" the condensing of essence."" - Yeats had this power. The passion of his poems was compressed into verse as strict as mathematics. To achieve it, it was necessary in the first place to bave something to concentrate on, and when there were neither ideas of any consequencc nor Passion, ""all you get is a form of stingincss.""
As an example of critical ineptitude, Dame Edith Sitwell took a passage from English Poetry, by Mr. F. W. Bateson, who wrote that poetry was "" no more useful, strictly speaking, than any other human activity,"" and that "" to make delight the basis of poetry is as wrongheaded as to make happiness, the basis of virtue."" If that writer had his way.- Dame Edith Sitwell declared. Keats, to mention only one great poet, would be of no worth. She went on to define' the maniy. uses of poetry. "" It is the deification of reality. It should make all our days holy to us. The poet should speak to all men, for a moment, of that other life of theirs that they have smothered and -forgotten.""
FEAR OF VIGOUR
After a reference to the need for live rhythms supported by live words-""-the fierce animal line that conveys vigour and fire ""-Dame Edith Sitwell paid tribute to the late Mr. Roy Campbell, -"" whose every line conveyed that vigour and fire."" Many critics of our time had a mousey fear of vigour, and of splendour; They regarded these as "" bad taste. like wearing a diamond necklace on a golf course."" Roy Campbell would never be admired by critics suffering from that timidity.
Dame Edith Sitwell also praised the Powerful qualities of Dylan Thomas, who. she said. ' strips from words their old, used, dulled sleepiness, and gives them a refreshed and awakened meaning; a new percussion."" Earlier, testifying to her eagerness to discover new talent, she reminded the audience that --It was L. and- not the people who helped him to his deatb. who first wrote of. and Praised. Dylan Thomas.-
In conclusion, she quoted with approval a tew young poets writing to-day, including Jon Silkin, Charles Causley, Burns Singer. Geoffrey Hill, and Quentin Stevenson. It had been her duty to- point out ""certain misfortunes in the present age of poetry in England,"" but these writers, she said, filled her with hope for the- future.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS237066416/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=1e67e97d

"" KING OEDIPUS ""
BY SOPHOCLES
TRANSLATION BY C. A. TRYPANIS
FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
OXFORD, FEB. 20
The contemporary stage has known much experiment in the translation of Greek tragedy, ranging from Professor Gilbert Murray's lyric apostrophesburnished but complex for Sophocles's stark grace-to an American Jason who, if memory does not painfully deceive, was referred to (without perspicacity) as ""a decent sort of chap.""
Professor Trypanis's new translation steers a moderate course between the two extremes: his verse moves in the clean rhythm of the sculptor's chisel, rarely jarring if without that spurt of imagination in which words seem to spring like flowers, miraculously, out of barren rock. But the real test of a translation is its effect on the stage, and in the performance by the Oxford University Poetry Society at the Taylor Institution to-night the play and dialogue retained their dramatic shape.
For Oedipus above all is a drama, both of character and structure, and if Agamemnon is the first murder play, here in Sophocles we have the first drama of detection, as superbly dove-tailed in its way as Ibsen's The Wild Duck, and with Oedipus as its classical Gregers Werle driving to destruction through his inability to let sleeping dogs lie. The disaster foreordained by destiny is precipitated by his own character, and this gives him the stature of a tragic hero, as volcanic in his pride as Lear, he is a man who must rip out the truth from the womb of time, and let the lava of his suspicion and impatience lose him the temperamental balance that might have kept him bis friends and given him royalty in defeat. Not for nothing Creon rcfers to ""self-torture,"" a ""sullen, angry mnercy,"" and flings the rebuke: ""To throw a friend away is throwing your life away.""
Yet if his passion can be wilful, ungenerous and unjust, it also has integrity, he is a king who can rule his subjects if not always himself, and this full authority Mr. David Webster at Oxford could not yet command-not. for instance, as Mr. Lindsay Evans as Creon commanded it at the end, although his rich voice could compass the gradations of rage and fear and he kept a grin on the character throughout. He was well supported by Miss Beryl Eeman's mature grief and dignity as Jocasta, and Mr. P. Billingsly as the Messenger told his final tale of woe with immense delicacy of expression.
Professor Trypanis produced the Play with a classical simplicity always mellow to the eye but the slow formality of the speech and movements of the Chorus gave a strictlY ritualistic impression which is rather alien to Sophocles, and muted the play's crescendo of conflict and revelation.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS67852373/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=acb53801

The Apollo Society.is enjoying a busy season just now, dispensing verse and music in a way that refreshes habitual readers and stimulates that great body of poetry lovers who somehow nev.er get around to opening a poetry book.
The latest series of six recitais' three before and three after Christmas, in the Recital Room of the Festival Hall, continues; except that the demand for tickets for February 3 proved so great that Dame Peggy Ashcroft, Professor C. Day Lewis, and Mr. Albert Ferber were able to fill the hall again on Sunday night.
The two readers were well contrasted: Dame Peggy Ashcroft nourishes her technique with an instinctive lyrical iipulse that is a joy to hear, whereas Professor Day Lewis's-by comparison-dry voice (the adJective is used apropos wine, not dust)
savours each word, while his poet's mind makes clear to us the form as well as ihe metrical ingenuity of what he is reading. The programme on Sunday was skilfully constructed. For instance, the invocation to wind and rain from Kathleen Raine's "" Northumbrian Sequence "" introduced Debussy's "" Ce qu' a vu le vent d'ouest,"" which set the mood for Shelley's ""Ode to the West Wind,"" which led into Debussy's "" L'Isle Joyeuse."" After an interval came Professor Day Lewis's own "" Moods of Love,"" and this, itself a sonnet sequence, formed something of a modem counterpart to Shelley's ode.
The series in the Recital Room continues on March 3, when Miss Flora Robson, Mr. John Laurie, and Miss Joan Davies are the artists, and on March 31, when Miss Margaretta Scott, Mr. Michael Hordern, and Mr. Julian Bream will perforrn.

HOW
TO ENJOY
By
Oliver Edwards
Apart from Old Possuem's Book of Practical Cats, I am no fan of Mr. T. S. Eliot. I do not understand much of what he has written; I am not attracted by the rest. But earlier this year Mr. Eliot went to the University of Minnesota and there delivered a lecture on "" The Frontiers of Criticism,"" which is the most. exciting and interesting thing of its kind I have read since A. E. Housman's TEe Name and Nature of Poetry.
Mr. Eliot, somewhat bewildered to find himself ""from time to time .. . regarded as one of the ancestors of modem criticism,"" set out in his lecture to show that "" there are limits, exceeding which in one direction literary criticism ceases to be literary, and exceeding which in another it ceases to be criticism."" His paper is easy to read and easy to understand. (Incidentally, he justifies the average reader of some of his work by confessing that, having re-read his own thirty-three-year-old essay The Function of Criticism, he found himself wondering what al the fuss was about.) But at Minnesota Mr. Eliot was not making a fuss. He was expounding a few simple, but modernly overlaid, truths. Leaving on one side such seductive pleasures as the idea that if Coleridge were alive to-day he would take a lively interest in the social sciences (I would give much to have a Coleridge essay on, say, Professor Barbara Wootton's Testament for Social Science; here would be clarity nobly obscured indeed), one quickly gets down to Mr. Eliot's main theme. It is to analyse the critic's most useful purpose. The nature of such writing involves him in discussing the nature of reading.
Each generation, Mr. Eliot asserts, must provide its own literary criticism; and each generation "" looking at the masterpieces of the past in a different perspective, is affected in its attitude by a greater number of influences than those which bore upon the generation previous."" Added to this, we now have a situation in which, with ""serious literary joumalism . . . an inadequate as well as precarious means of support for aU but a very few,"" many of the critics are teachers, and many teachers are critics. This means that "" the critic to-day may have a somewhat different contact with the world, and be writing for a somewhat different audience from that of his predecessors."" No one can deny this. To me it seems we have not gained. The pedantries and aridity of much modem literary criticism are surely due to the fact that it is written by specialists for specialists. "" A good deal of contemporary criticism,"" says Mr. Eliot, "" originating at that point at which criticism merges into scholarship, and at which scholarship merges into criticism, may be characterized as the criticism of explanation by origins."" This leads him to two books "" with which everyone should be acquainted ""-John Livingston Lowes's Tite Road to Xanadu and James Joyce's Finnegans Wake.
It also leads him to the reflection that the one thing they have in common is that we can say of each of them: "" One book like this is enough.""
Mr. Eliot thinks that the best of his own literary criticism has been that on poets and poetic dramatists who have influenced him. But, he says, this kind of "" workshop criticism "" has one obvious limitation. "" What has no relation to the poet's own work, or what is antipathetic to him, is outside of his competence."" Also such a critic's judgment "" may be unsound outside of his own art."" Again "" the question of how far information about the poet helps us to understand the poetry is not so simple as one might think."" A different answer may well have to be given not only for each poet but also for each reader. Mr. Eliot takes as example Wordsworth, and the various biographical guesses about Dorothy, Annette Vallon, and Wordsworth's marriage. For himself, he confesses, "" I feel no need for any light upon the Lucy poems beyond the radiance shed by the poems themselves.""
Understanding a poet and understanding a poem, he asserts, are two different things.
I am even prepared to suggest that there is, in all great poetry, something which must remain unaccountable however complete might be our knowledge of the poet. When the poem has been made, something new has happened, something that cannot be wholly explained by anything that went before.
Revising a former definition he made of the function of literary criticism he now simplifies it to be to ""promote the understanding and enjoyment of literature."" Understanding and enjoyment, he stresses, are not separate activities. "" To understand a poem comes to the same thing as to enjoy it for the right reasons."" Praising the worthwhile is more important than condemning the second-rate. Eventually he is led to this summing-up:
We can therefore ask, about any writing which is offered to us as literary criticism, is it aimed towards understanding and enjoyment ? If it is not, it may stiU be a legitimate and useful activity ; but it is to be judged as a contribution to psychology, or sociology, or logic, or pedagogy, or some other pursuit-and is to be judged by specialists, not by men of letters. We must not identify biography with criticism: biography is ordinarily useful in providing explanation which may open the way to further understanding; but it may also, in directing our attention on the poet, lead us away from the poetry. We must not confuse knowledge-factual information -about a poet's period, the conditions of the society in which he lived, the ideas current in his time implicit in his writing, the state of the language in his periodwith understanding his poetry. Such knowledge, as I have said, may be a necessary preparation for understanding ihe poetry; furthermore, it has a value of its own, as history; but for the appreciation of the poetry, it can only lead us to the door; we must find our own way in.
So much do I agree with all this; so thoroughly have I been stimulated by the lecture that I feel I must have been reading Mr. Eliot with a blind eye in the past. I am going to try him all over again.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS218453871/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=30842489

Miss Margaret Rutherford, Mr. Christopher Hassall, and Mr. Osian Ellis joined last night in a recital of poetry and music for the harp which was given in memory of Walter De La Mare. A large audience filled the Recital Room of the Royal Festival Hall and strove, with qualified success, to maintain that degree of absolute silence exacted by occasions of this kind.
Poems by De La Mare occupied only the first half of the programme. It was the inferior half. The choice of music was apt (in particular a superbly evocative Impromptu by Rotissel), and groups of poems discriminately selected. But most of them were killed in the act of declamation- the inner voice cannot with such facility be translated into public utterance. The only poem that escaped diminution was ""Three Jolly Farmers."" a piece with strong rhythm and narrative line.
Mr. Hassall read sensitively, if without any marked distinction. It was Miss Rutherford who made the evening memorable, for her reputation has been made in caricatLring occasions of this kind. Her gestures are familiar-the imperious toss of the head, the jaw gamely squared. Last night these were seriously applied, though we have come to know them as the stock in trade of the outraged games .mistress and the lady trapped at the frontier with excess baggage. It was tempting to take every rustle of Miss Rutherford's dress for a joke, and to imagine that her reading (which was intelligently considered) would at any moment be rudely interrupted by a gang of mutinous fourth fotrmers.
Miss Rutherford came into her own in the second half of the programme by reading Virginia Graham's ""Panic."" This episode of office life concerns a letter whose loss drives a secretary to the brink of suicide. Miss Rutherford's development of this farcical crescendo established her once again as a performer who, on her own grotnd, is unrivalled.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS202331990/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=1926f9a2

GOLD
MEDAL
By Oliver Edwards
This is being written-to use a phrase first attributed to Charles Lamb, a fact which should delight our subject-con amore. It is appreciation, not criticism. No doubt both time and learning could do it much better, and so one day someone will do it. But the news that the Queen's gold medal for poetry has been given to Edmund Blunden is so splendid that I cannot withhold a short note of pleasure. I have not consulted thoroughly the now fairly long line of his works. Those I have by me are only the Poems up to 1940, Undertones of War, T7te Bonadventure, The Mind's Eye and Votive Tablets. I shall therefore say nothing of his later work, or his devotion to Charles Lamb, Shelley, Keats, Vaughan, and Clare. It is no matter. I have cargo enough.
The first things that strike one about this little collection are its diversity and its quality. Nature and war poems; war book, travel book, literary and other essays-each is first class in its kind. Each, too, has stayed the course; When recently I quoted a list of 1914-18 books I had compiled in the 1930s, more remonstrances were made about the omission of Undertones of War than of any other work. The men who knew remember. There is the honesty of the opening sentence: ""I was not anxious to go."" There are such things as this:-
Daytime was play in the Islands [a part of the front near Festubert] that summer; night was a perpetual tangle. If one went forward patrolling, it was almost inevitable that one would soon creep round some hole or suspect heap or stretch of wired posts, and then, suddenly one no longer knew which was the German line, which our own. Puzzling dazzling lights flew up, fell in the grass beside and flared like bonfires; one heard movements, saw figures, conjectured distances, and all in that state of dilemma. Willow trees seemed moving men. Compasses responded to old iron and failed us. At last by luck or sorm stroke of recognition one found oneself; but there was danger of not doing so; and the battalion which relieved us sent a patrol out, only to lose it. that way. The patrol came against wire, and bombed with all its skill; the men behind the wire fired their Lewis gun withno less determination; and, when the killed and wounded amounted to a dozen or more it was found that the patrol and the defenders were of the same battalion. I knew the officer who led that patrol; he was by temperament s,uited for a quiet country parsonage, and would usually have mislaid his spectacles. Or this from the poem ""Third Ypres"" which he included in the same volume.
The hour is come; come, move to the reliefl Dizzy wc pass the mule-strewn track where
once The ploughman whistled as he loosed his
team; And where he turned home-hungry on the
road, The leaning pollardmarksus hun grerturming We crawl to save the remnant who have torn Back from the tentacled wire, those whom no
shell Has charred into black carcasses-Relief !
They grate their teeth until we take their room And through the churn of moonless night and
mud
And flaming burst and sour gas we are
huddled Into the ditches where they bawl sense awake, And in a frenzy that none could reason calm, (Whimpering some, and calling on tht dead) They turn away: as in a dream they find
Strength in their feet tobear back that strange Their body.
Blunden once complained of the ""slight injustice - done to him by the assumption that because The Shepherd won the Hawthornden Prize he must be a rustic poet. We must avoid the other injustice of giving the impression he is predominantly a First-war writer, although-as he himself pointed out ill the collected volume of his poems upto 1930 -war became part of his experience so young as to ""mould and colour the poetry almost throughout this book."" He also reflected 10 years later that "" those who saw that tremendous time will know that it does not easily give up its hold."" But he has many other strains. Poems such as "" The Covert "" and "" The Barn"" take us into the heart of old England; and the last verse of ""The May Day Garland"" shows how beguilingly he wages his war with our old enemy.
And for these courteous children. And Love that's ever a child
The May should never fade to-night Could Time but be beguiled,
Could Time but see the beauty of These singing honied hours,
And lie in the sun adream while we Hid up his scythe in flowers!
With most poets, perhaps, there is too great a readiness on their readers' part to believe they are speaking in person when really they are singing in character. Blunden has warned us that many of his pieces were written "" not as elements of an autobiography but in the spirit of projection and daydream."" Yet here and in many other poems I amn sure we have the man.
We have him, too, in The Bonadventure, which is one of the truest pieces of reporting that has come from a tramp steamer. Then there are the essays. These reveal more by implication, however. Votive Tablets contains his best work; The Mind's Eye, ranging through Flanders, Japan, England, and literature, displays his many-sidedness better. Some of his essays have been written for special occasions, a centenary, a new book coming out, a cause to be supported. But it is the choice of these things that can tell us much. Edmund Blunden has rarely written on a subject that did not engage his interest. It is sometirnes said that he has not fulfilled his earliest promise, that the flow of creative work has not been kept up. If this is so-and I do not know what he has unpublished-it may be because he has of late years been fully occupied in being a good citizen of the world of letters.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS185423596/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=54305dad

OFF TIE GOLD STANDARD ?
By
Oliver Edwards
Tell me the poetry a man can recite and I will make a fair guess at his age group. For the sponges we are in youth soak up two kinds of verse: that of the established canon which appeals to us, and whatever in contemporary writing fires our imagination. To be precise, it is most likely to be poetry just passing out of being contemporary. The very young do not get on to the newest thing, but to the newest that seems on the way to becoming established. So it is that many men (and women) in what I still like to think of as vigorous middle age have an abashed predilection for quoting Flecker.
This first came home to me in a romantic fashion. Being held up in Honolulu during the war, waiting for some corner of a bomb-bay into which we could be stowed, a fellow victim and myself arranged to meet at midnight on the terrace of the Moana Hotel. There, under the great banyan tree, at our feet the surf gently rolling up Waikiki Beach (a triumph of advertisement over Nature, if ever there was one), we took it turn and turn about to recite poems to each other till our repertory was exhausted. And when we finally went to bed about 3 a.m. I suddenly reaiized what a standby Flecker had been to me. In fact I seemed to know more of his work by heart than that of any other poet.
How many bells, I wonder, do 'Saadabad,"" "" Riouperoux,"" ' The Old Ships,"" "" Yasmin,"" "" The War Song of the Saracens,"" and "" The Golden Journey to Samarkand "" ring with the young to-day ? Flecker has not been well served by the anthologists. The Oxford Book of Modern Verse has only three of his poems; the Albatross Book of Living Verse one; the Faber Book of Modern Verse none. Robert Lynd put two of Flecker's best pieces into his collection, but then one could always be sure of Lynd. Richard Church's Poems of Our Time 190042, one of the most representative and most intelligently arranged of all modern anthologies, has "" The Old Ships."" And yet Martin Secker's noble edition of the collected Poems runs to well over a hundred items with very little juvenilia. We are a long way away from the days when it could be confidently proclaimed that Flecker's work ""l ike some masterpiece of Greek sculpture ... will be found to epitomise its period ""; that he would "" be read and admired centuries after those who were his contemporaries have passed away ""i; and that "" in the years to come generations of poetry-lovers wil1 be eager to know what kind of man he was.""
Was this all far-fetched ? Might I just as well throw away my long-hoarded first edition of The Old Ships (complete with mermaid removed from the later covers)? Or is Flecker merely in the
usual trough ? (Forty years after death is a long time to stay in it.) Clearly if he is going to journey through the generations and the centuries, some of his cargo will have to go overboard. Looking at them again Jately I found The King of Alsander, Flecker's only novel, better than I had remembered it; the Collected Prose not so good. Neither, I think, has any chance of survival. And as a letter-writer Flecker was ordinary. We are left then with Hassan, Doin Juan, and wvhatever we choose to keep from the poems.
The two plays have rather played Box and Cox with each other. For many years Flecker was known almost solely as the author of Hassan. Don Juan was just another play he had written. But slowly it has, in estimation, crept up to its more famous fellow and, in some people's view, even passed it. The fact is that Hassan needs to be superbly well done (which also means extravagantly mounted) not to seem tinsel. Don Juan, as George Bernard Shaw was the first to see-and as a television Performance some time ago reminded us-exists in its own right. Don Juan; Frarnlingham, the Conservative Prime Minister; his two daughters; and the soothsaying Owen Jones are all flesh and blood in a way Haroun, Rafi, Pervaneh, and even Hassan himself are not. Don Juan, moreover, has for the past 20 years had an altnost topical relevance. Flecker knew nothing of modem dictatorships or of the hydrogen bomb, but the poet in him seized the deep anguish of the moral dilemma in choosing between peace and war.
For, no matter in what form Flecker was writing, he was always purely and simply a poet. For that reason I myself think Hassat will prove the more enduring play of the two. The golden road to Samarkand may have got a little oily of late, and in poetry as in so many other things we have temporarily gone off the gold standard. But both plays will come back to the stage from time to time as new producers with imagination and courage and the love of the running line arise. And on many shelves and in many hearts they will long find a place. So will such poems as ""Tenebris Interlucentem,"" "" To a Poet a Thousand Years Hence,"" -The Old Ships,"" "" Riouperoux,"" "" StilLness,"" "" Pavlova in London,"" "" In Phaeacia,"" "" Santorin,"" "" Brumana,"" "" The Old Warship Ablaze,"" and "" Saadabad."" Their harmonies and melodies may seem uncomnfortably pleasant to the ear in this cacophonic age. But Flecker spoke truly when he said in the preface to The Golden Journey to Samarkand that he had written "" with the single intention of creating beauty."" He fulfilled his intention. Surely that is something which will last ?",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS184899116/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=0a01b207

HYMNS
AS POETRY
By Oliver Edwards
It has long struck me as strange that the anthologists of English poetry have shown so very little appreciation of the literary merits of many of the English hymns. The Golden Treasury contains not one, and The Oxford Book of English Verse but a very few. Those which Q admitted were an early sixteenthcentury example, Henry Vaughan's "" My Soul there is a Country,"" and Addison's "" The Spacious Firmament on High."" One might have thought that, after so nobly, with that last poem, ushering in the great era of English hymn-writing-let us call it that from Addison to Newmanthe anthologist would have been emboldened to give some other examples. But no. There is not another hymn (in the generally accepted sense of the word) in his selection of what was finest among the shorter English poems.
Can it be that the English have so much the habit of keeping their various types of thought and feeling in separate compartments of their minds that they cannot think of hymns as literature ? Or is it a form of Puritanism which refuses to see aesthetic qualities in an essentially religious exercise of words? If this latter be true the Puritanism is one not shared by our neighbours the Welsh, for when the late W. J. Gruffydd in 1931 compiled his Welsh anthology he drew more numerously upon William Williams Pantycelyn, the greatest of the Welsh eighteenth-century hymn-writers, than upon any other poet except Ceiriogand one of the latter's contributions, even, was a hymn. Yet the best English hymn-writers were by any unbiased standards poets of very notable rank.
The hymn, as a literary form, has one special claim upon the esteem of anyone who has been a professional writer. In the hymn the writer must express himself With sincerity of feeling, vividness of phrase, and eloquence, within a comparatively limited choice of metres, and within a range of subject-matter and thought dictated to him by the tenets of his faith. There ale, let it be admitted, a vast number of hymns in which this searching test has been too much for the poet's skill. And there are a good many cases, too, in which words and tune form so much a single unit in the mind that it is hardly possible to disentangle the strictly literary element. I remember that the singing in school chapel of "" I praised the earth in beauty seen,"" with the moving final lines of its first stanza, ""And earth and ocean seemed to say, Our beauties are but for a day,"" brought to the adolescent mind a sudden sharp realization of this world's transitory nature-a lasting emotional and aesthetic (though not I think religious) experience. Yet how much of that effect was due to Heber's words, and how much to the noble air by John Hullah to which we sang them, I cannot now attempt to determine.
For all that, however, there are Many hymns about whose merits as poetry there can be no doubt at all-especially among those of the eighteenth century.
There was a precision, combined sometimes with orotundity, in the poetic diction of that time which served the hymn-writer admirably, and which he could use with complete sincerity-as could be instanced again and again from Charles Wesley, and perhaps above all from Isaac Watts. How can any anthology of English poetry be adequate which does not contain the poem that has probably moved more English people more deeply than any other? ""Our God, our help in ages past"" (which is how Watts began his poem) is full of the most vivid and exquisitely phrased images. And in Watts, too, are some of those overwhelming anthropomorphic visions which were characteristic of his century:-
My God, who mak'st the sun to know
His proper hour to rise,
And to give light to all below,
Dost send him round the skies.
There is, implicit in that stanza, a vivid way of seeing things which one finds again, half a century or more later, in the most beautifully worded of Cowper's hymns:-
God moves in a mysterious way,
His wonders to perform:
He plants His footsteps in the sea,
And rides upon the storm.
Try mentally to materialize those two stanzas, and is the result not something very close in kind to the visions which William Blake expressed in watercolour ?
Nor are these isolated, or especially rare, instances. The eighteenth century supplies many other hymns which may be read with aesthetic enjoyment; and in one of these, Toplady's "" Rock of Ages,"" there is an impassioned mystic self-abasement, almost a self-torture, very different from the common placid standard of religious feeling anid expression in England:-
Nothing in my hand I bring; Simply to Thy Cross I cling;
Naked, come to Thee for dress;
Helpless, look to Thee for Grace; Foul, I to the fountain fly;
Wash me, Saviour! or I die.
How can the anthologist - unless blinded by some irrelevant consideration -have failed to appreciate the qualities of such poetry ? It is too much to believe him so inhuman that he can have read, without trembling on the verge of tears, H. F. Lyte's sonorous, melancholy, and yet uplifting valediction:
Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day; Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away; Change and decay in all around I see;
0 thou who changest not, abide with me.
Rather one imagines that some stubborn, half- unconscious resistance, based on the feeling that poetry ought, at least in itssimplerforms, to beabletomake its effects without calling in aid all the spiritual suggestion which lies within the religious and devotional themej that it should bea ""pure"" art, has as a rule inhibited him from giving way to his own instinctive feeling. If so, it is time that he should recant, perhaps taking the very words of his recantation from another great and beautiful hymn:
""Pride ruled my will: remember not
p-ast years.""",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS51074300/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=9775144c

TRANSLATED LYRICS
By Oliver Edwards
How is one to iudge of the merits of lyric poetry written in a language with which one is not, or only imperfectly, familiar ? That is a question by which many devoted readers have been bothered-some of them to the point -of forswearing the reading of all translated verse, since, they would say, poetry is untranstatable. To them, one of the first pleasures of learning a new language comes when, with grammar 'cook and dictionary in hand, they succeed in construing a few short and simple lyrics. Then, to their eyes, appears a new, subtly national vision of the beauty of the world, differing refteshingly front that of the poets of any other-literature, even though dealing with the same elementary materials.
That sense is perhaps but an illusion; for how is one to tell how those same lyrics appear in the eyes of readers to whom the language is the mother tongue ? Does Verlaine's 11 pleure dans mnon coeur sound and mean-or-perhaps better imply -the same to English as to French readers ? The question is unanswerable. Yet the thrill of first peering into the poetry of another tongue remains one of the joys of reading-and what is more, often rouses in the reader a longing to transpose this newly descried loveliness into his own tongue, partly, no doubt, for the edification of his monoglot compatriots, but much more for his own satisfaction-to; show: himself that be can (or possibly, if he is quite honest with himself, that he cannot) do it.
This itch to translate is very widely spread. Dr. Johnson was rendering Horace into English verse in his schooldays, and his last English poem, writter in November, 1784, was a version of Diffugere Nives:
The snow dissolv'd no more is seen,
The fields, and woods, behold are green-
the same ode which A. E. Housman rendeied very beautifully into the idiom of his own day, later by almost a century and a half. Yet, in so far as each translator abandoned Horace's metre, and substituted one from his own national tradition, it is certain that neither version can fali on English ears just as the Latin did on Roman.
it may be that the happiest results come when the translator does not tie himself too closely to the original. This freedom he sometimes takes avowedly, as when Cowley described his Anacreontiques as "" translated paraphrastically,"" or sometimes leaves to the reader's perception, as when William Johnson expanded six lines of Callimachus into the eight famous lines which are among the comparatively few lyric translations that have their own standing as English poems. In that small class, too, may perhaps be put that sonnet of Yeats which, nevertheless, though it starts with a miraculous echoing of Ronsard, soon slips away into the Celtic mnists.
Undoubtedly, however, the most notable example of a translation which is an English poem in its own right is FitzGerald's Rubaiyat, a piece which is additionally curious in that it itself has been translated into other languages, once, at least, with remarkable success. I have lately been trying to make some acquaintance with Welsh poetry, and have been able to recover something of that same thrill of discovery that I knew when, in youth, I first dipped into French verse. One Welsh poem I have come across is Sir John Morris-Jones's translation from FitzGerald, and with this I tried the experiment of reading aloud a particular stanza to two English friends who know no Welsh. It was correctly guessed, in one case straight away, in the other at a second hearing, by both friends as ' A book of verses ""-and so on. Evidently, therefore, the translator had caught the metre and sound of -the English very closely-though whether FitzGerald did the same for the Persian is another matter.
As for the reverse process-Welsh poetry to English-a craft which Sir Idris Bell has practised with distinction-there is obviously much Welsh verse that is untranslatable, if translation is to keep the metre and sound as well as the sense of the original. Yet there are some pieces which are perhaps possible to attempt-and being no less subject to the itch of translation, and no less hopeful, than some of my betters, I have tried my hand at a few of them, for example, one of the Hen Benillion, or old traditional verses
While yet the salt is in the sea
And in the wood the green birch tree, And still the crow feeds by the shore, My dearest dear, I'll corne no more.
And while the gable-end is white
And on the dove are feathers bright, And oxen tread the meadow track
My dearest dear, I'll not come back.
In sense (ipart from some liberty with the crow, who, in the original, -tends his nest, and won't rhyme in English) that seems to me fairly near the mark, and the metre will perhaps pass. But does it mean to the English heart what the original does to the Welsh ? Ah, there indeed is the rub; but at least it is fun to make the attempt.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS218453178/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=59e88856

RHETORIC AND VISION
GEORGB BARxER: A Vision of Beasts and
Gods. Faber and Faber. 9s. 6d.
Mr. George Barker's new volume, which is the second choice of the recently founded Poetry Book Society, marks a definite stage forward in the development of this gifted and uneven poet.
There has never been any doubt about Mr. Barker's vigour and dash, but fastidious critics have sometimes found his language gaudy and even flashy, and the emotional attitudes struck in many of his poems morbid and strained. It has been easier, also, to indicate his talent. by reference to isolated lines and stanzas, to a generally diffused energy, than by pointing to any poem which has been certainly a success as a whole. Mr. Barker's most serious faults, inflation and pretentiousness, are not absent from A Vision of Beasts and Gods, but the book contains a number of poems-notable among them ""Letter to a Young Poet,"" "" Channel Crossing."" "".The Dying and Heroic Captives of Italy,"" "" Love Letter,"" "" Epitaph for Many Young Men "" in which Mr. Barker displays both a new confidence in the organization of a poem round a general theme and a new sensitivity towards some of the quieter modulations of lanzuage.
The two longest poems in Mr. Barker's book, "" Goodman Jacksin and the Angel "" and the sequence "" Justice at Midnight,' are less satisfactory, though for contrasting reasons. The first of these poems, a dialogue between personifications of man's carnal and spiritual natures, is an eloquent but slightly diluted versification of theoloRical commonplaces. "" Justice at Midnight,"" a meditation on God's justice and mercy from the desperate, but not quite despairing, sinner's point of view, is more personal in its appeal, but more obscure in its symbolism. An aspiring melancholy, a cry for light from the darkness, for water from the dust, is the general mood of these poems. It is a mood whose dignity compensates for a certain inherent monotony in its scope. There is still a certain ""staginess "" in Mr. Barker's rhetoric-sometimes we cannot help feeling that he is using his words to whip up his feelings-but on the whole his manner in A Vision of Beasrs and Gods has a more sensitive unity than in any of his previous volumes.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS138105571/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=d00fe151

VERNON WATKINS: The Death Bell.

Faber and Faber. 9s. 6d.
Under the auspices of the Arts Council the Poetry Book Society has come into being, in order that once a quarter a volume may be selected for its members. The first volume thus to be chosen is Mr. Vernon Watkins's, and in addition a recommendation has been extended to Mr. Nicholson's The Pot Geranium.
Thus the society comes into action with a flourish; for Mr. Watkins is already known as one of the few contemporary poets who can handle extended forms with success, and Mr. Nicholson's elegance has been widely recognized. Since, therefore, in both cases the poet is too skilled to be accused of an uncertain aim, the occasion is a good one for trying to assess the justice of their reputaltions.
Mr. Watkins is a Welshman, and in his earlier volumes, The Ballad of the Marl Lwyd and The Lamp and the Veil, he cultivated a richness of utterance which ran parallel to Dylan Thomas. He has now pared his exuberance to a much greater economy of phrase, and at the same time adopted a stricter metrical framework, both in the ballads which comprise one part of his book and in the lyric poems which make up the rest. His poetry is thus more accessible than formerly. It exemplifies a very general tendency to break away from the gnomic or the ambiguous modes which were fashionable before the war, in search of a fresh simplicity, and there is no reason why even those who are chary of modem poetry should miss the pleasures which are scattered through these pages.
The same might be said of Mr. Nicholson. He cannot be catalogued simply as a country poet of exceptional grace and, where it is appropriate, keen wit. His poems are always lively expressions of a temperament, and they will appeal to anyone with an ardent visual sense and an ear for music. Neither poet, perhaps, is at full stretch in these volumes, but both offer ample justification for the existence of the Poetry Book Society.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS151474856/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=1a57140b
By Our Art Critic,A Vein Of True Poetry,The Times,1954-Mar-13,"London, England","A VEIN OF TRUE POETRY
MR. AUGUSTUS JOHN'S EXHIBITION
AT BURLINGTON HOUSE
By Our Art Critic
For some years the work of Mr. Augustus John has not stirred up much excitement among artists or critics. He has continued to be watched with unabated interest by the public and by Fleet Street as the President of Bohemia; collectors have continued to acquire, and to send up the prices of, his early drawings and the paintings which they considerit is surprising that they should, on the whole, be so seldom mistaken-to be of the right period and to represent the right subjects. But it is only necessary to compare the influence that Sickert has continued to exert on British painting to see that unlike him Mr. John is not one of those fortunate artists who need fear
nothing from the movements of fashion I and taste.
The exhibition which opens to-day ini the Diploma Gallery at Burlington House makes this neglect seem outrageous, but at the same time explains it. Apart from a small group of his earliest paintings, it divides easily into three parts. There is a dazzling display of his drawings, which occupies the greater part of two rooms. There is a compact group of 36 of the small panels he executed between 1910 and 1914, and with these goes an admirable choice in another room of portraits done for pleasure at the same period and also the single example of his large compositions of many figures, the ' Lyric Fantasy,"" painted during these fruitful years. Then there is the work of the professional portrait painter, mainly from 1918 onwards, but with some earlier portraits such as the well-known painting of the Lord Mavor of Liverpool; with the portraits go other examples of his later work, still-life and landscape subjects which in the later years may be considered the portrait painter's relaxation. As an appendix there are seven works of sculpture, an art which Mr. John has practised only in the past year. No works from the Tate are included.
A GREAT DRAUGHTSMAN
The effect of the drawings, when seen in such abundance, is overwhelming. They do more than explain why Mr. John's contemporaries were convinced that here at last was a great modern artist in England; they suggest even now that a genius of that order had really appeared. Perhaps it is as well to be a little suspicious of Professor Brown's and Professor Tonks's standards of draughtsmanship, since they were capable of deciding that an artist whose work was not realistic in a particular way was simply unable to draw. But their standards were, after all, based on an acute appreciation of certain old masters and the work of MIr. John is in itself a proof of this. He could, as this exhibiticn shows, turn out a drawing with an almost supernatural resemblance to any one of some half-a-dozen old masters, not merely a pastiche of Rembrandt, Tiepolo, or Watteau, but a work done directly from the life in their manner. And this strange faculty is evidence of how well Mr. John had learned his art in the best of all schools, that of the museums; they illustrate what devotion to great art accompanied his virtuosity.
Unfortunately the Slade did not then teach its pupils how to paint in oils, even though Steer might, on occasion. do what Mr. John himself considered his most beautiful, because his least inhibited, painting on the canvas of a pupil. The earliest pictures in this exhibition are talented enough, but from the first it is clear, and particularly in the portrait.
' Merikli,"" of 1902, that the young artist had had no real grounding in the specific task of the painter in oils, the business of completing a picture without
spoiling the quality of paint. And even if the Slade had shown the way to a solution of this problem, what kind of painting then existed, in which such equipment as Mvlr. John had could have found full and satisfactory employment ? His power of draughtsmanship would have fitted him to work in Raphael's studio, but in 1900 there was no way in which it could be used directly and with conviction.
As it happens, the example of a very minor artist turned Mr. John into a painter. Round about 1910 he conducted, with Innes, a private and insular postimpressionist revolution. The figures that he could have drawn in the round with such power were now flattened to bare silhouettes; the detail that he could have included in a drawing without in any way impairing the breadth of the design was now ruthlessly left out. But the coiour is radiant and clear, and the paint, which has aged very beautifully on almost all the small panels of this time, is laid with a sweet and sensitive touch.
CELTIC SENTIMENT
At the same time Mr. John now found expression for the vein of true poetry that runs through the best of his work. In part the sentiment of these pictures is Celtic, otherworldly, and ideal, but never for a moment did he paint in a Celtic twilight. To these blue distances and golden suns Mr. John transferred, not some wraith of the literary imagination, but quite simply and in literal fact his family and friends. And as it was said that no one who had not lived before 1789 could know "" les douceurs de la vie,"" so these pictures seem inspired by the happiness of life before the First World War, the now unimaginable happiness of a young painter who could have a very successful exhibition, make perhaps £50, and with it take his family to the seaside in the South of France.
Mr. John has made a creed of independence and perhaps it was natural that he should be more readily influenced by a small artist than by another great man. But just as his draughtsmanship needed for its full employment a tradition like that of the Renaissance, so when he became a modern painter his art needed the only kind of tradition that exists to-day, the influence of one or two great artists and the climate of fiercely critical opinion that such a man can create in his immediate neighbourhood.
STUDY OF CHARACTER
And this was all the more necessary because Mr. John chose to practise an art which nowadays is guided by fewer and lower standards than any other kind of painting; his interest in character and the gift for catching a likeness which shows itself even in his most decorative compositions almost inevitably made him a portrait painter, but the result was that he now had nobody except himself to say whether anything was properly painted or no. And quite clearly Mr. John is not a good critic; the unevenness of his later work is really startling, and this even in the simplest technical matters, like the introduction of a sudden patch of flat and inexpressive paint into a firmly modelled head. He remains a force and a power and every now and then there is a picture, a landscape or a portrait, of one of his sons, in which all has gone brilliantly well. But though it is impossible not to see that here is a great man, this is too great a man, one sometimes feels, to practise the painters' slow and nine-tenths mechanical art.

Null,Mr. Eliot's Three Voices,The Times,1953-Nov-20,"London, England","MR. ELIOrS THREE
VOICES
UNDERSTANDING TIE
POET
MR. T. S. ELIoT yesterday urged an audience of about 2,500 at the National Book League's annual lecture, in the Central Hall, Westminster, to bear with the apparent obscurity of some poets and to try to understand their language. His lecture was entitled ""The Three Voices of Poetry."" These three voices were, Mr. Eliot explained, the voice of the poet talking to himself-or to nobody; second, the voice of the poet addressing an audience; and, third, the voice of the poet when he attempted to create a dramatic character speaking in verse.
Some poems bad indeed been written for one person, but, said Mr. Eliot, a good love poem, though it might be addressed to one person, is always meant to be overheard by other people. - Surely,"" he added, ""the proper language of love-that is, of communication to the beloved and to no one else-is prose.""
Mr. Eliot then traced the distinction of the three voices in his own mind, as a writer of poetry. In writing The Rock, he had come to realize that verse to be spoken by a choir should be different from that to be spoken by one person, and that the more the voices who had to speak it the simpler it must be. The choruses of The Rock were examples of the second voice. In them he spoke for himself. In Murder in the Cathedral, however, the choruses had to be consistent with the character of the Women of Canterbury: but the drama was still fought out in one person through whom the author could speak. There was no real "" third voice.""
In a verse play; the author must not identify himself with any one character, and give him all the good lines. He must sympathize with all his characters, but give them only such poetry as was plausibly attributable to them. The dramatic monologue was an example of the second voice, even in a play. But Brown:ng's poetry had a dramatic element in it which was more nearly akin to the third voice. "" Is there, perhaps,"" asked Mr. Eliot, ""another voice of the dramatic poet whose dramatic gifts are best exercised outside the theatre ?""
CLARITY AND OBSCURlTY
Turning back to the first voice, Mr. Eliot said that there was a kind of poetry in which the poet did not know what he had to say until he had said iL ""He is oppressed by a burden which he must bring to birth in order to obtain relief."" Mr. Eliot did not believe that the relation of a poem of this class to its origns could be more clearly traced than that. The poet must above aU be concemed to achieve clarity for himself. ""The most bungling form of obscurity,"" said Mr. Eliot, "" is that of the poet who has not been able to express himself to himself; the shoddiest form is found when the poet is trying to persuade himself that he has something to say when he has not.""
Even if a poet had written a poem primarily without thought of an audience, he would also want to know what it had to say to others. ""If you complain that a poet is obscure and apparently ignoring you,"" Mr. Eliot said, "" . . . remember that what he may have been trying to do was to put something into words which could not be said in any other way, and therefore in a language which may be worth the trouble of leaming. If you complain that a poet is rhetorical and that he addresses you as if you were a public meeting, try to listen for the moments when he is not speaking to you but merely allowing himself to be overheard: he may be a Dryden, a Pope, or a Byron. And if you have to listen to a verse play, take it first at its face value, as entertainment, for each character speaking for himself with whatever degree of reality his author has been able to endow him.""",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS186339700/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=d769b6ed

A NEW ANTHOLOGY
The Faber. Book of Twentieth Century
Verse. An Anthology of Verse in Britain, 1900-1950. Editors: John Heath-Stubbs and David Wright Faber and Faber. 12s. 6d.
In compiling this anthology the editors were faced by the difficulty that Michael Roberts's Faber Book of Modern Verse stood formidably as "" the standard anthology in its field ""-the phrase is worth quoting because it is the claim made for it by the publisher. In what field, then, could a new anthology stand, covering much the same period of time and many of the same poets as its predecessor ? Upon what principles has it been compiled ? Mr. Heath-Stubbs in his introduction suggests that what he rather obscurely calls ""the antithesis of style"" in twentieth-century poetry "" is really the contrast of Innocence and Experience, the
one dominated by the image of a Garden, the other by a City."" The anthology seems based upon this conception: thus Mr. Heath-Stubbs discovers a "" pastoral mood"" in the poetry of Hardy and A. E. Housman, and finds "" the image of Innocence"" in the ""mature work"" of Miss Sitwell, Mr. Eliot and Mr. Dylan Thomas.
PERSONAL PREDILECTIONS
This seems a strange approach to a halfcentury which has been marked by a change in the language of poetry as great as that which took place during the Romantic revolution. What- it arnounts to in practice is simply an expression of that ""' personal predilection "" to which all editors must confess, untouched by any social or historical principle but generally attached to a mild romanticism of mood and language. One admirable feature of The Faber Book of Modern Verse was that Michael Roberts managed to include work by almost every poet. of recognized importance at the time he made his choice: and where anthologists depart from this practice, as the compilers of the present book quite markedly do, it is not enough to say that their reading has been full and conscientious and that "" any glaring omissions will. .. probably be intentional."" There are poems here by Hardy, Housman, Yeats, Mr. Auden, Mr. Eliot, and others which would merit inclusion in any anthology of the half-century's poetry; but there is much work also which, when the wide field to be covered is borne in mind, reveals standards of judgment that can only be called eccentric.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS171135280/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=89756289

QUESTION OF COPYRIGHT
FROM A CORRESPONDENT
The Arts Council bas only recently interested itself in the cause of poetry and the small sum which it is now putting by-just under Â£1,000-is helping, in a modest way, to encourage the appreciation of verse through the spoken word. The grants go to local poetry and literary societies (some of them very small) that organize public verse readings by professior.al readers and, where possible, by the authors themselves. Many of these societies, especially in the midlands and the north, are descended from the Philosophical Societies that were in vogue in the early days of Queen Victoria.
The idea of promoting the cause of poetry in this matter sprang originally from the prize poem competition held in connexfon withi the Festival of Britain. More than 2,000 entries received for this competition were published in a Penguin volume, 28,000 copies of which were bought by the public. The Arts Council then set up its own poetry panel, and though it was unsuccessful in obtaining an increase in its annual Treasury grant for this purpose, it was able to find nearly Â£1,000 within the limits of its existing resources. When copyright poetry is included the authors are entitLed to a fee, but many societies do not apparently realize that a reading constitutes, in effect, a public performance. More pertinently, many of the poets themselves do not seem to be aware of the fact that they may claim fees for the public reading of their works. To remedy this the Art5 Council's poetry panel has been trying to find a simple and effective means of assessing fees and collecting themn without discouraging those interested in the promotion of the readings. The Copyright Committee of the Board of Trade IS now working out a report on the questioin of copyright as a whole, which will embrace recorded poetry. But whatevef changes may be proposed the council hopes that they Will no prejudice the position of the poet, nor bamper the use of copyright poetry by those seeking to make it better known.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS151867140/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=0450ad76

Louis MACNEICE: Ten Burnt Offerings.
Faber and Faber. 1Os. 6d.
Mr. Louis MacNeice, of the generation that held the poetic limelight during the thirties. is these days by far the most prodigal of his talent. Mr. Auden operates gravely, obscurely, and sometimes beautifully from America, it is true; but Mr. T. S. Eliot seems to meditate more on the structure of drama than on the writing of poetry as a natural way of expression. At any rate, the shorter poem no longer seems to interest him. Mr. C. Day Lewis, in the habit of a professor of poetry, devotes most time to disquisitions on technique and to ambitious translation. Mr. Spender writes autobiographical prose, criticism, rapporrage, and vows to keep his poems on ice.
Mr. MacNeice alone seems to think instinctively in poetic terms and Ten Burnt Offerings. the product of a year with the British Council in Greece, is evidence of vitality and genuine experiment. Mr. MacNeice has always used the social life going on around him, the common shared details as well as private situations. as raw material for his poetry, and as a result any book of his has great imn-mediacy. He is, if such a thing may be said, the right kind of contemporary poet: scholarly, historically and socially aware, with a fresh, idiomatic use of language, an eye for his environment.
Although the 10 long poems of this new book are uneven, they have all these qualities. Only the attractive lyrical poet, the observer with a sardonic but exciting eye, has an affected alter ego, a parlour-room wisecracker who juggles with rhetoric, religion, philosophy, and metaphysics as though they were oranges. The technical sleight of hand can often be admired, but less often its intentions. Luckily three or four poems, inspired by India or Greece or by characters from classic legend, come through unscathed. Then it is possible to observe a distinguished poet working through a period commonly considered devoid of poetic impetus.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS136269559/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=cb3ba7fe

NEW THEATRE
IE-COCKTAIL PARTY""
"" THE -~COCKTAIL PARTY-""
.By T. S. ELIOT
It has been an exhilarating night for the few who have always clung to the belief that poetry remains the natural as it is the traditional language of the English stage. They have seen actors who were speaking yerse to a modern theme put an audience on easy terms with a play built deliberately on a popular model, an event to send them away glowing with positively sinful pride in their loyalty to a cause which has so often during the past century flickered into life only to flicker out again.
It may flicker out yet again. What encourages the hope that it wil not is that this time the poet-dramatist has driven straight at the capital difficulty of verse drama. Mr. Eliot has picked a form which prose realism has worked to the point of exhaustion; and into it he has breathed new life.
The importance to the theatre of The Cocktail Party is the practical proof its affords that verse can give refreshing precision to the light, easy, amusing exchanges of fashionable drawing room comedy, and that the new idiom of which it makes actors free has also in its power to give a haunting intensity of its own to the rather frightening moral implications which it discovers beneath the surface of the comedy. At the Edinburgh Festival, in New York, and now in London, too, as would happily appear from last ni$ht's response, audiences have found themseIves at home with this verse. It has stirred, amused, challenged their imagination: it has, in short, entertained. The medium of their entertainment is verse which while keeping closely in touch with the development of their own speech, is yet able to rise, by almost imperceptible transition, to passages of grave and high beauty. It is not the beauty of verbal splendour but of verbal power, designed to serve the ends of a dramatic action which at the proper moments it iiluiinates and transtigures. From this poetry the anthologies will gain nothing; the poet is single-mindedly a dramatist and it is strictly dramatic poetry.
The action deals with problems of personal dissatisfaction which are the current coin of West End comedy, and they take shape from the sprightly extravagances of cocktail party chatter. There are losses, but there are also gains, in this recast production, but Mr. E. Martin Browne has taken care that the essential values of the play should be preserved. It has less comic verve, but more force than the Edinburgh production now in New York.
Mr. Rex Harrison gives the psychiatrist a less cryptic, a more professional, air than Mr. Gunness, with the result that the ' guardians ""
-on one plane of 'reality accomplished worldings, on another symbolizing jointly the silent moral self with which the wilful superticial self must sooner or later reckon-are made more readily acceptable. Julia's desolating trivialities are theatrically less amusingly, but more plausibly'pointed by Miss Gladys Boot, and Mr. Robin Bailey, the third guardian, is also less amusing and more plausible.
But Miss Margaret Leighton takes full advantage of the opportunities Celia gives her. Celia is the social butterfly who has the courage (arising from despair) to face her own truth. Miss Leighton and Mr. Harrison are both equal to the demands of the scene which is without a rival in modern poetic drama, that in which Celia chooses the hard, the terrifying way. Mr. Ian Hunter makes a humorous and *a human figure of the husband who is incapa'ble of loving (is he, by the way, so rare a specimen as romantic drama assumes ?), and Miss Alison Leggatt does not spare the wife who is incapable of loving.
It is a structural weakness of the drama that by the end of what is really the second act the main crises have been virtually resolved. The long final scene with only the fate of those who made the choices to describe is in danger of being no more than an epilogue to the play. Mr. Eliot meets the danger by defining and intensifying the connexion between the world of life and the other world where, in Shelley's phrase, "" do inhabit the shadows of all forms that think and live tiU death unite them and they part no more."" He also administers some well-calculated shocks to the sensibility by the psychiatrist's full acceptance of the enviable fate of those whom a strong sense of vocation has led to martyrdom.
These measures successfuUy renew and sustain the threatened tension, and the final impression is that the various choices and their implications have found something near to complete theatrical fulfilment. Paradoxically, the play, by its very completeness, takes on complexity. From this nch complexity we may draw many different meanings, each "" according to his capacity.""

LOAN EXHIBIMTON IN
LONDON
The loan exhibition of editions of English poetry got together by Mr. John Hayward for tfie National Book League was opened at 7, Albemarie Street yesterday by Mr. John Masefield.
It is certainly the most complete collection of first and early editions of the English poets, from Chaucer to the.present day, that has ever been shown in public; the only comparison is with the exhibitions of. the Grolier Club in New York, but these displayed only the works of single poets or single periods. With the books are shown some most interesting portraits, including the fine portrait of Dryden by Kneller, the "" Deanery I. portrait of Donne, Severn's drawing of Keats, Richardson's Matthew Prior, and Watts's Tennyson.
The exhibUtion is designed to satisfy the strictest requirements of the bibliographer and bibliophile, and the catalogue, compiled by Mr. Hayward, is extremely detailed and should be of the greatest! value to students; much of its information is also of interest to the general reader. - At the same time the public is invited to indulge its appetite for historical ironies by observing the rare volumes in which poems now universaUy known made their first shy and often unsuccessful appearance; it seems almost incredible that many of the books should be in such perfect preservation.
The exhibition begihs with Lord FitzWilliam's copy of Caxton's "" Canterbury Tales,"" the only copy still in private hands in England and in wonderful condition. In the rich collection of incunabula and other very early works may be seen a great curiosity, Walter Smyth's "" Wydow Edyth,"" a unique copy of the first edition of a work hitherto known only to the most erudite. The Elizabethan age and the seventeenth century are represented by the finest specimens of the major and ninor poets, and the eighteenth and nineteenth century collections contain many volumes of the highest rarity, including the juventha of the most eminent poets. Among the modern volumes is a copy, lent by the King, of Mr. Masefield's "" Reynard the Fox,"" which the Poet Laureate illustrated himself and presented to King George V.

The word "" diseuse "" in English usage has come to mean not a speaker but a singer with insufficient voice to sing anything more than quasi-dramatic ballads and sketches. Miss Baker is both more and less than a diseuse, *in that she does not attempt to sing but is an accomplished speaker. Her selection of pieces which she recited between Mr. Foggin's groups of piano solos was apt and varied: it contained prose as well as verse, humour as well as lyrics, and character studies presented with just the right degree of suggestiveness.

THE POETRY OF
LANDSCAPE
INTERPRETATION IN TWO
STYLES
At the comprehensive exhibition of 54 new paintings and drawings by Miss Ethel Walker, at the Lefevre Galleries, IA, King Street, St. James's, Shelley's remark that to go to him for a fact was like going to a
gin shop for a leg of mutton is recalled.l This is not to say that Miss Walker's work is alcoholic or that she flouts the facts of nature, but only that she works by distillation rather than by carving. From whatever she finds in nature she distils the essence in its values of tone and colour, and her work is to be judged and enjoyed accordingly and not as an exercise for the teeth.
In the case of a less experienced artist a smaller exhibition than this might have been advisable, but Miss Walker has reached a stage in her career when everything she does is to be accepted with gratitude for what it gives-and a wise tolerance of what it does not. More truly than of any other contemporary artist can it be said that her defects are the defects of her qualities. If there be a general and characteristic defect in her work it is that she is inclined to neglect that machinery of the picture which is a consideration preliminary to painting. For lack of that machinery the large painting of the nude, "" The Bather,"" looks rather helpless. On the other hand "" Models Resting "" shows that, when it comes to her at once, Miss Walker can make a completely satisfactory composition of large-scale figures. It is possible that if the shadows about the legs of the farther figure had been a little lighter in tone the implied space in depth between the two figures would have been more consistent with their difference in scale, but otherwise the composition is as logical as it is pleasing. A special word is due to Miss Walker's treatment of the nude in general. She excels everybody in the kind of sublimation which excludes the animal but preserves the human being, and not the least attractive thing about "" Models Resting "" is the effect of a human as well as a pictorial relationship between them.
With a few landscapes, of which ""The White Village"" is a delightful example, the exhibition consists of portraits, nudes, flower paintings, and marines, but whatever the subject there is the same presentation of essence rather than facts. As may be seen in "" M. Lucien Pissarro, Resting,"" and "" Tom Moossom, Fisherman,"" Miss Walker can paint men, but it is questionable if her qualities are not most fully expressed in her portraits of young women. "" Nicolette "" is an exquisite example. Among the flower paintings "" Contrejour "" and "" Flowerpiece "" may be picked out, and among the marines "" Seapiece, an August Morning "" and ""April Storm."" Miss Walker is a poet with the brush. She may supply matter for the argumentative-like the Scotsman reading "" Paradise Lost ""-but in matters of taste, feeling, and colour she never lets you down.
At the same galleries there is an exhibition of 26 pieces of sculpture by Miss Dorothy Charol. By far the best things among them are the small bronze, ""Horror,"" which shows interesting contrary movement, and the two terra-cottas, "" Supplication "" and "" Dream,"" which have a Tanagra quality. Miss Charol's efforts at stylization do not inspire enthusiasm.
MR. JOHN NASH
Mr. John Nash is to be congratulated on his present exhibition of 35 new watercolours at the Goupil Gallery, 3-5, Burlington Gardens, which gives a more complete impression of his talent than we have had before, His work has always shown great sensibility and a poetical appreciation of landscape for its own sake, irrespective of human association, but hitherto it has been a little lacking in the qualities that distinguish the work of his brother, -Mr. Paul Nash. In these water-colours he adds to his poetry a more intellectual grasp:of both landscape structure and the form of the picture. It is not a-case of imiitation but of clarifying his own aims, with the result of sharpening, if anything, the temperamental differences between the two artists. It is evident, for example, that though he gives sufficient indications of depth, as in ""Corner of a Field, Wiston,"" Mr. John Nash js not acutely interested in threedimensional composition but rather in the surface pattern of the picture, in which he shows a fertile invention, with unexpected rhythms. He is particularly happy with the clean spaces of snow and sand dunes, as in "" Snow,"" "" Winter,"" "" The Frozen Pond, Meadle,"" and"" Sand Dune, Matterhorn""; otherwise preference -geherally goes to the water-colours in which the landscape is seen through a screen of trees, such as "" Wood on the Beach, Penmaen,"" "" In the New Forest,"" and "" Woods by the Shore, Gowver.""",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS168375430/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=be36e7b7

W WORDS FOR MUSIC
THE LYRICS OF HENRY
NEWBOLT
It is symptomatic of the habit of segregating the arts that a long obituary notice of Henry Newbolt contained no reference to his songs as such. "" I did not know he was a musician,"" someone may say, and the answer is that he was not. But he was one of the few poets of the present day who could write poems which come to life when they are sung. Not all lyric poems have that quality. Some of the finest in the English language tempt the musical composer only to defeat him and his colleague, the singer. They read like songs and the literary critic expatiates
on their musical charm, but the moment the composer begins his search for the right tune he discovers that they have no need of one. The rhythm is too irregular, the imagery too rich, the thought too condensed. The poem is so complete in itself that it will not bear the musician's touch, however delicately applied. He may coax it into becoming a song by an artistry too subtle for the comprehension of the generality of singers. or it may lure him to the use of technical artifices which defeat their own end. The result is artificiality. This accounts for the fact that most of the great songs of the world, from Purcell to Brahms, have been settings of words which a fastidious taste condemns as at best second-rate poetry, while the unfastidious public clings to the false doctrine that
So long as the tune has a r iglht good swving, It doesn't much matter what words you sing.
It was Stanford who discovered that Newbolt's verse had in it the makings of fine song. The verse mattered: it had character and purpose and a charm of its own, but it was not filled too full. It offered a stimulating suggestion to the musician and lent wings to his melodv. When the Songs of the Sea"" were prodttced at a Lceds Festival 34 years ago the apostles of musical advance wrote them down as cheap and obvious because Stanford had caught the essentials of the poems and the first essential was a simplehearted sentiment. The lyric in each case yielded up the right tune to the composer easilv enough, at least so it seemed to the listener. One cannot read "" Drake's Drum "" and "" The Old Superb "" now without hearing Stanford's music. Words and music so belong to one another that one is almost persuaded that the poet wrote his verses with Stanford's tunes running in his head. These poems seemed to offer the composer an easy success. But let the rash critic who thinks that try what he can do with one of the sea ballads which Stanford did not set. He will soon find what need they had of the composer's genius, that anyone less sensitive to the implications of words than Stanford will inevitably overstress the obvious sentiment and turn the song into a bald banalitv.
If these particular songs are not as popular as they were in the first 20 years of their life, that is because the present generation has grown afraid of the rattle of Drake's Drum for reasons which have nothing to do with the artistic merits of the songs themselves. But there are others both in this set and in its later companion "" Songs of the Fleet"" which strike deeper. "" Homeward Bound"" and "" Farewell,"" to name one from each set, are songs the poems of which would live by themselves, but they are greatly enriched by the music which thev inspired. Such a line as
Soft as old sorrow, bright as old renown
needs music, and just such music as the composer found, fornits fulfilment.
Many of Newbolt's songs were written in the hope that they would find muisic. which distinguishes them from those lyrics written to make a music of their own. A few were written with the definite purpose of providing a text for the musician. That is always a purpose dangerous to the poet, but Newbolt could surmount the danger. He did so very largely in the libretto of the opera The Travelling Coinipanion, which he wrote at' Stanford's request, for whatever is unsatisfactory in that work is due to inexperience of what is necessary to the construction of a stage play, not to any weakness in the lyrical portions. The unsullied freshness of the girls' chorus ""All in a morning glory,"" and the Princess's song in the second act, show Newbolt at his best, and those numbers brought Stanford up'to his best.
The poem called ""The Wandercr"" in the collected volume is also a song written to order,, though no one who reads it for the first time there would guess that it was. Many years ago a composer, not Stanford this time but Walford Davies, and Newbolt's own particular singer, Harry Plunket Greene, were planning a song cycle together and trying to do it without the collaboration of a living poet. The English poets from Shakespeare to Robert Browning were drawn on, for the thing was to be not so much a cycle as a suite, contrasted songs linked by. a certain sequence of thought. But a hitch came where something in the nature of a light and buoyant scherzo was needed,for.which no words were forthcoming. Most of the poems were chosen and the music composed, but when the series was tried over in private the need for the scherzo was felt by all who heard them. Then Greene said, "" I wonder if Newbolt could write something,"" and the result was ""To youth there comes a whisper out of the West."" It is a perfect little song in two four-line stanzas, each of which is shaped for melody with a climax in the last line. When the song cycle was produced in public it was the most successful of the series, which suggests that song is liable to contradict the proverb that two is company and three none. When the poet, the composer, and the singer are good company song flourishes. Newbolt's spark of poetic genius glowed most brightly in company with the musicians.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS168243863/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=341437a2

Thic story of Hcinrich Heine, told on Saturclay ni-ht by Count Alfred Hcssenstcin and illustiatcd by Schumann's music, might have piovided a golden opportunity for introducing new listeners to the charm of German Lieder.

Even those listencrs who havc loved the Dichrterliebe as long as they can remember, must have felt a pang of disappointmcnt at this curtailing of the songs, and it seems doubtful if those who did not know German got any really clear idea of them. This was a pity, as Count Hiessenstcin has a talent for invoking the spirit of charm and pathos of the romantic movement.
Heine was born to suffer, and he found in the cold eyes of his cousin Amalia the inspiration for one of his most famous poems, "" Ich grolle nicht,"" written by Heine on the news of her marriage to another man. Schumann's song was heard, almost entire, in a magnificent recording, and a rough translation of the words beforehand would have been invaluablc. "" Die beiden Grcnadicrc "" was linked to his sight of the tattered remnants of Napoleon's army returning from Russia through DUsseldorf. The lovely song about Cologne Cathedral and Lochner's Dombild was however quoted too carly in the broadcast, as though it werc merely a description of the Rhine, instead of a marvellous transcription into music of the sight of the great Cathedral reflected in the river. Heine's visit to England was never even mentioned. but his romantic friendship with the beautiful Camilla on his deathbed was delicately treated, and the party of Camilla was sympathetically spoken by Mme.

MR. YEATS'S ANTHOLOGY
THE OXFORD BOOK OF MODERN VERSE,
1892-1935. Chosen by W. B. YEATS. Oxford: Clarendon Press. London: Milford. 8s. 6d.
By a happy inspiration the Oxford Press. has chosen whom many would choose as the greatest liying poet for the editor of the volume which brings down to the present day the series of Oxford Books of Verse.
Mr. Yeats contributes not only some of the finest poems included in the book, but also an introduction which is a brilliant and penetrating essay on English poetry during the last half century. He is magisterial in his justification of the principles on which his selection has been made. He rejects, for instance, a large body of ""War"" poems on the ground that "" passive suffering is not a theme for poetry,"" and justifies his ruthless abridgment of the ""Ballad of Reading GaolU' with the words ""my work gave me that privilege."" In that case, the poem as he prints it is his vindication; but he is less happy in his treatment of Pater's famous Mlona Lisa passage, which, presented as a piece of vers libre, seems jerky in its rhythm, in spite of a textual alteration evidently intended to accommodate it to its new form. The device was necessary, however, if the passage was to be included in this anthology, and Mr. Yeats was evidently resolved by placing it in the forefront of the book to acclaim Pater as in some sense the inaugurator of modern poetry, in the comprehensive sense in which the phrase is used in the title of this volume.
It may surprise some readers to find in a book with this title poems by Dowson and Wilde, Henley and Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, as well as poems by Mr. Eliot, Miss Sitwell, and Mr. Dav Lewis; but Mr. Yeats rightly claims that "" even a longlived man has the right to call his own contemporaries modern ""; and the period which the book embraces-from ""The Hound of Heaven "" till after "" The Waste Land ""-falls within the lifetime of men now living. Moreover, the revolution which inaugurated the period-the liberation of poetry by writers of Mr. Yeats's generation from the ""impurities"" of politics and morality-was as important as any of the changes which have transformed poetry so bewilderingly during the last quarter of a century.
Mr. Yeats writes with penetrating insight of the different influences at work in poetry during the period he discusses, and with remarkable sympathy of some of its latest developments. Those who would cavil at his principles of selection, or at the high arguments with which he justifies them, may reflect that any ordinary man can be mechanical, and that greatness, even whgre it is wilful, is given us to learn from, not to teach.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS168898420/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=6d48a3e3

KING GEORGE'S REIGN IN VERSE AND MUSIC TRIBUTE OF THE. B.B.C.
Last night the B.B.C. paid in English verse and English music a tribute to the life and memory of King George V. At the first thoughi it did not seem possible that a'concrete idea of what King George was to his country and his people could be constructed out of ternis in poetry and music that have no specific reference to him, but such is the wealth of English poetry and the inspiration, infrequent, perhaps, but so audible when it is there, in English music that at the end of the hour it seemed almost as though the poets and musicians, the dead and the living, had collaborated with each other in full consciousness to give shape and expression to the character of King George and the eventful history of his reign.
Four Sovereigns of England stood out before King George, announced the prologue; Alfred, for whom spoke Mr. G. K. Chesterton in his "" Ballad of the White Horse "" ; Henry V and Elizabeth, who had Shakespeare as their interpreter; and Victoria, with Tennyson as her Laureate. The broadcast followed on without any break for a specific commentary. King %George's love of the sea and the growing idea of Empire wore represented by extracts from the works of that- great Englishman who died such a little time before his King, Rudyard Kipling, and the approach to the Great War found its echo in 'the symbolism of music and the equally majestic music of the Bible. The broadcast reached its greatest height in the minutes it attempted to convey something of the feeling, not only for the cause for which the country was fighting, but for the land, the land of hedgerows and little fields and quiet hills which the English volunteer army left for other and alien shores. A poem by the present Poet Laureate which he wrote in August, 1914, a poem in which he found a precise and perfect expression' for his love of the Berkshire Downs, was followed by one by Wilfrid Owen, perhaps the greatest of all the poets slain in the War. Rupert Brooke might well have found his way into the noble band of those who spoke for England and their King, for the work he did in the early davs of the War mirrored with a crystal intensity the mood of passionate idealism in which the'young, untried manhood of the country went to battle.
The end of the War, the trials and anxieties of the transition period, and the steady mounting of the love of the people and the prestige of the Crown until the glorious triumph of the Silver Jubilee was reached, was expressed last night in the words of Mr. Siegfried Sassoon's "" Everybody Burst Out Singing,"" which, although it was written for another occasion, caught the exultant gaiety of the time. The passage from Ecclesiastes, "" Remember now thv Creator in the days of thy youth,"" and a number of lines from Wordsworth's "" The Happy Warrior"" brought the broadcast towards its close, which was finally reached with a verse from Kipling which by implication commemorated the Queen, as some verses from the Psalms had done earlier, and with some lines by Mr. R. Ellis Roberts, .who was .responsible for the arrangement of the broadcast, which ended with the words, ""This man wvas England.""
The music of Elgar, Gibbons, Sullivan, Vaughan Williams, Parry, and Purcell gave the right background to this story of the Throne of England and of the life of one of its most beloved Sovereigns, but it was the spoken word of the poets which gave it at once its majesty and its intimacy. The thunder of the Biblical cadences and the musings of Thomas Hardy as he walked his Wessex lanesKing George moved in the spirit of both and both had helped to make his England. The verse was eloquently, but not too eloquently, spoken by Mr. Felix Aylmer, Mr. Laidman Browne, Mr. Robert Farquharson, Miss Lilian Harrison, Mr. Ralph Richardson. Mr. Robert Speaight, and Mr. Ion Swinley.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS134688316/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=16a5e55e

BALLADS, SONGS, AND RHYMES OF EAST
ANGLIA. Arranged with Notes by A. S. HARVEY. (Norwich: Jarrold. London: Simpkin, Marshall. 5s.)
Among the many pleasant and useful forms which local patriotism may take is the collection of poetry and verse connected with a particular part of England. Mr. Harvey's East Anglian anthology is compiled upon the principle of giving, where possible, entire poems, or at least fairly long extracts; and his collection is arranged under three heads: Early Ballads; Songs and Rhymes of the Peasantry; and Modern Ballads.
The folk-songs which he records include versions of such well-known things as "" The Sprig of Thyme,"" "" TwentyEighteen,"" "" The Thresherman and the Squire,"" and ""The Tree in the Valley "" (here called "" The Immutable Tree ""). But much the most remarkable of them is the strangely beautiful old ballad that begins:-
My father was the first good man
Who tied me to a stake;
My mother was the first good woman
Who did the fire make.
My brother was the next good man Who did the fire fetch;
My sister was the next good woman
Who lighted it with a match.
They blew the fire, they kindled the fire,
Till it did reach my knee;
0 mother, mother, quench the fire-
The smoke will smother me !
East Anglia has been peculiarly lucky in being the setting for many of our best ballad stories. There was the Battle of Maldon, in 991, which furnishes the gallant tale of Brihtnoth's defence against the Danes, and of his death at their hands. There are the ballads associated with the shrine of the Virgin at Walsingham. There is the immortally touching legend of "" The Babes in the Wood,"" whose father,
A gentleman of good account,
In Norfolk dwelt of late
Who did in honour far surmount
Most men of his cstate.
As for the pieces of known authorship, they, too, include many celebrated narrative verses. Was not Boadicea, "" bleeding from the Roman rods,"" as Cowper sang, Queen of most of what is now East Anglia ? It was in a Norfolk town, too, that the Yorkshire murderer, Eugene Aram, was arrested, as Tom Hood so dramatically wrote: -
That very night, while gentle sleep,
The urchin's eyelids kissed,
Two stern-faced men set out from Lynn
Through the cold and heavy mist; And Eugene Aram walked between,
With gyves upon his wrist.
These poems Mr. Harvey quotes in full, and he gives also two gently pleasing ballads by the almost forgotten peasant poet of the early nineteenth century, Robert Bloomfield. Nor have legends of the Eastern Counties failed to find modern poets and versifiers, represented here, to tell them once again.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS119090737/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=7457ed55

Two books on eighteenth-century nature poetry provide the theme, in the leading article, of an original examination of the poetic diction of the English ""Augustan Age."" The writer, while not defending the age from the assaults of the later romanticists, insists on the necessity of that much criticized diction to embody the poets' conception of man's control of nature. If the use of "" Augustan "" phrases is properly understood, the argument runs, the effectiveness of the poetry made out of them may be seen for what it was.
The new novels reviewed include Miss Mary Ellen Chase's "" Silas Crockett "" and an English translation of "" The House of Cosinsky,"" by Peter Mendelssohn. The intellectual evolution of M. Romain Rolland is discussed in a criticism of his "" I Will Not Rest,"" in which the French author makes a selection from his writings to illustrate his political progress from detachment
above the battle "" to advocacy of Communism. Other books reviewed include "" The Governments of the British Empire,"" by Professor Keith; Mr. F. J. Harvey Darton's study of village life, "" English Fabric "" Mr. J. W. Linn's biography of Jane'Addams; ' The Strange Life Story-of Willy Clarkson,"".by H. J.

ENGLISH AND AFRIKAANS
INFLUENCE OF NEW ENVIRONMIENT2
By Professor J. P. R. Wallis
M OST discussions of Anglo-South
African poetry start from Mr. A 4 Rudyard Kipling's obiter dictum which'. the sometime President of Magdalene caught up into his chapter in the concluding volume of the Cambridge History of Literature. The laureate of Imperialism, when asked ,what South African poetry there was besides his own, replied: "" As to South African verse, it's a case of there's Pringle and there's Pringle, and after that one must hunt the local papers, There is also, of course, F. W. Reitz's Afrikaanse Gedigte, songs and parodies 'in the Taal, which are very characteristic."" It is matter for regret that Sir Herbert Warren, who had done much lecturing upon the literature of the Dominioris, allowed this judgment to influence hinm so far as to limit his "" autoschediastic "" survey to Thomas Fringle all but exclusively. For the opinion upon which he justified himself in his own eyes is no more true than that Mr. Kipling is a South African poet.
The insurmountable obstacle in the way of those who would discourse of South African literature is that as yet it does not exist. There is a Union, but it has not unity in any. intimate spiritual sense of the word. It still speaks with two voices, and neither carn claim to express the whole. But nothing is here for tears or perturbation. But the furnaces and anvils of Los, as Blake would have said, in the fashioning of the generations of men, condense an age into a hammer-stroke, and know nothing of our fume and fret for"" results."" So the dispassionate observer, privileged spectator of a fascinating phase of evolution, sees in the rivalries of the twin tendencies, tP e English and the Afrikaans, not an antagonism but a composition of forces, whereof the resultant is neither one nor the other, but a diagonal into which both are merged equably. Therefore, in dealing here chiefly of .English developments in South African literature there is no hint that it is greater or less than its compeer, still less any vain essay to prophesy that in the end this or this will emerge supreme.
IN EARLY TIMES
To, revert then, to the early chapter of the story, which need not take us farther back than the middle decades of the last ccntury, 'so recent it is. Much has been made of the criticism that colonial literaturec.is. mainly derivative. This is, and, of c6urse, must be, a consideration that makes it all the more interesting. Literature'is no plant that thli,ves in new soil. It requires rich depths, age-long accumulations-of association and tradition, native and inalienable. When, therefore, it is s'6t in another hemisphere, under another sun, and in an entirely novel environment, it presents fascinating problems in what may be called literary ecology. To those who come from the riches of the opulent
North what South Africa offers may seerrflike poverty itself. But to look closer is to see and appreciate processes that are not only interesting in themselves but that by contrast throw into fresh relief factors in the aesthetic life of the Old World which are too little regarded. There are compensations, too, in being permitted to study a literature in the making.
In the early times, that chronologically are so incredibly near, the modest civilization of the Cape Peninsula (which was all that counted then) was a simple and isolated thing, with its remoteness accentuated by the tardiness of communications. And, reading the signs, one gathers that' the sense of strangeness, almostjpf exile, was stronger than that of intimacy evenrin acommunity numerically small and inevitably thrown into close contact. When, therefore, the desire for self-expression' asserted itself, it was natural that the spirit, overleaping the sundering leagues, should return to the familiar modes. This, indeed, is true of later singers, nor is their work the- less South African therefor.
Unfortunately no one has yet undertaken to tell 'in anything like detail the literary history gf these early years. The late-Professor John' Clark, of Capetown University, had the work in hand, but it was left unfinished at his death. The material, too, is not easily come by. Many of the slim volumes; often the products of local and homely presses, have dropped out of sight, and the search through contemporary newspapers and magazines is laborious and not often rewarded by finds of notable worth. Still it ought to be done, a work of love for some devout South African. Part of the interest will ie in the recovery of picturesque life-histories. There is, to cite a minor example, the case of Stafford Cruickshanks, ""late of the Grenadier -Guards,"" as he declares on his first title-page. One of a numerous and hard-pressed Irish family, he narrowly' escapedremigration to America as a child, had little schooling of the formal kind, escaped from the drudgery of unpromising occupations'. by enlisting, served in the China wars, and then came to the Cape, where he seems to have spent most of his time in the Grahamstown district. He was an ardent missioner in the cause Qf temperance, and his zeal therein informs much of his, verse. For all his poetic ambition-he put out four cantos of rhymed couplets on "" Predestination ""- he is at his best little more than facile, and shows' most effectively in light tale or topical satire.
HENRY FOOT
There is more of culture and "" taste ""- the - outmoded word best denotes the quafity-in "" makers "" like Henry Martyn Foot, a Nonconformist parson who left Devon in search of health, and towards the end held the chair of English Litera-
ture and Philosophy in the South African College. As in his successors, John Noble and John Clark, a shrewd wit and masculine good sense brace his style, and if it can scarcely be said to soar, it does at least march briskly. Or there was Mrs. M. E. Barber, born Bowker, by descent and by marriage connected with two families who have left their marks on local history. She
had An earnest and'tuneful gift, and may be taken as one of the earliest of a long
line of women writers whose work graces if it does not exalt South Africa's poetic achievement.
The editorial rule that living writers may not appear in the Cambridge History excluded many veterans, like Dr. Kolbe, from Sir Herbert Warren's survey. Coleridge, who heightened eulogy in praising Pringle, might, in a more candid mood, have been led to speak of these poets as being ""like little potatoes-no great tlhings."" But that will not quite do. They have their virtues-sincerity, thoughtfulness, and the senise of poetic values. Dr. Kolbe, for instance, is a singer of delicate fancy, light and flexible, and of a pleasant urbanity. The general reader can catch something of the savour of him and his fellows in E. H. Crouch's "" Treasury of South African Poetry and Verse "" and in the later "" Centenary Book of South African Verse"" by F. Carey Slater.
These little anthologies illustrate the broad differences between the early and what may be called the middle periods in South African verse. A concise statement
O:)n.W tss Pauli-nesaiuh's delicate talent had, as she herself tells, tobe coaxed into utterance by Arnold Bennett's fostering interest, but the result; her tiny sheaf of exquisite vignettes, justified him and her. Too many others, less sensitive, have overworked the elegiac mood, confounding it with the lugubrious, which South African life and character are not. In striking contrast stands the work of Mrs. Sarah Gertrude Millin. Alike in her novels, her discursivewritings, and in her notable study of Rhodes,her spare,tight-lipped style will concede nothing to easy and refracting sentiment. With her the bare dispassionate statement, judicially aloof, has to make its own way; the naked arrow-shaft, lightly
barbed and tightly feathered, best exemplifies her manner, which at times almost diverges into a mannerism. But if it is a weakness it is a good onie.
There is one vein that might be. explored to greater advantage than it has been. Mrs. Margaret Alston's ""An Old Cape Homestead "" illustrates the kind and its charm. There is much, overmuch, talk of South Africa's spell, but in general it stops there. The loving intimacy that gave England "" The Compleat Angler"" or
The Natural History of Selborne"" or ""Fallodon Papers,"" has given little token of its existence among South Africans, yet few peoples enjoy a heritage of richer promise in this kind. It is still much the same with her wonderful past. Only the politically minded have tapped it, and not for the highest purposes. The records of the first travellers, traders, hunters, and adventurers are brimful of every variety of interest, lying on the surface, ready to hand. But daily some precious portion drops away, with the passing of some old inhabitant, and few regard it. Fortunately there are signs of awakening conscience in this connexion, notably in the emergence into public recognition of the lifework of Dr. John G. Gubbins,-embodied in his rich collection, of Africana now housed in the University of Johannesburg.

The older strands persist, a background to the new variegation of pattern. Sometimes the shuttle carries threads of alienseeming twist, yet they belong and are congruent. Charles Murray-"" Hamewith "" Murray-came from Aberdeen, bringing; his rugged northern dialect with him and the lilt of the northern tunes. Yet he is as South African in the fullest sense as any of "" the sons of the soil."" The country and his part in it set him singing ""The Whistle "" and "" The Back o' Beyont"" no less than "" Hamewith.""
Later English South African verse is as old-fashioned and as "" modem "" as English verse anywhere else the world over. It can match the newest vagaries, and parody them too, as Mr. John Ross, ol Kimberley, has done. Some day perhaps this retiring maker of -pleasant verses may be persuaded to admit the world at large to the enjoyment of what has hitherto been reserved to his friends.
Looking back over the course of this story one finds it easier to understand the work of Roy Campbell. It would seem as if he saw, or thought he saw, thatpoetry in the Union had fallen into a
bad rut of style aL. that a kind of spiritual in-breeding was most perniciously debilitating it,. What should have been a spirited adventure was sinking into a spinsterly hobby. Wherefore, after minor sallies, he plunged heels over head into a boisterous sea of verse and buffeted his way amazingly over or through the tumble and swirl of it in pursuit of his monstrous Behemoth of a theme. Now and- again it looks as if ne momentarily loses way, or comes near to foundering in the enormous turmoil. Buit it was a dashing enterprise, one of the most daring the country has Icnown. It stirred comment, not always of the wisest, and he retorted with his succession of satires in the Churchill vein. He castigates with gusto, wielding the lash with the same headlong dash that had gone to the chasing of the Terrapin. It is a pity that bot youth cared so little whether he flicked the offender or the inoffensive. Latterly he has turned aside to chase or bait other game, contenting his pen with exercises of slighter compass and quieter style, as in his ""Flowering Reeds"" and his "" Broken Record,"" with its memorable glimpses of his early days in 'Natal and its attractive picture of his father.
Tnere is nothing to tell of the drama in a country where the commercial theatre is a monopoly and the repertory movement. a tentative affair. But in prose a wider reputation has been won. There are the famous names, with a goodly following of modestly respectable minors 'in the work-a-day modes. Olive Schreiner is already'a classic, with the world's implication of an over-readiness to take her fame and worth on trust. Sir Percy Fitzpatrick's memories and sketches are chiefly historical, but his ""Jock of the Bushveld"" holds its peculiar place unrivalled.

SPEECH AND SONG
THE POET'S LIVING
VOICE
Poets have recently shown an increasing anxiety lest their art should become a dead language, written and read but never spoken. M^r. Laurence Binyon's valuable article contributed to The Times Educationzal Suipplement of December 1 declares their anxiety and describes the means now taken to encourage the appreciation of poetry through "" presentation of the poem in the living voice."" Such presentation he maintains
can communicate a pleasure such as many who know poetry only on the printed page would never have expected. And if poetry is not enjoyed what is the use of learning it or teaching it ?
Every musician must sympathize with Mr. Binyon's argument and may take comfort from it for the comparatively backward condition of education in the "" sight reading"" of music. We are, perhaps, fortunate in the fact that few of us can read the score of the Ninth Symphony as easily as we read a speech from Shakespeare, and consequently our pleasure in it is dependent for the most part on our hearing of it. We are still a long way from having to defend music from becoming a dead language. The day may come when scores of the Beethoven Symphonies will be given as school prizes or issued by newspapers at special subscription rates to their readers on filling up a coupon. In that day musicians will have to take action similar to that which the Poet Laureate, Mr. Binyon, and the English Verse-Speaking Association are taking now. Meantime, all except a few overeducated specialists know that if they want to enjoy music they must play it or sing it, go to concerts, or at least buy a wireless set or a gramophone; they know at any rate that thev cannot get their enjoyment by reading in a book. Because of this music remains the art in widest popular cultivation.
The poets are taking example from the musicians and are attempting to organize the teaching of speech on lines similar to the teaching of song and instrumenl. Mr. Binyon alludes to "" choral speaking "" as "" a recent development rich in possibilities."" Just as there are many who cannot sing a song but can join in a chorus, so,
teachers in schools have discovered that many boys and girls are too shy to attempt a solo recitation, but when they have the support of cornpanions and are trained to speak as a team they lose their shyness and by degrees they gain the confidence to speak alone.
"" Choral speaking, however, is not merely a tool in the hands of the educationist; it is claimed as an art to be cultivated for its own sake and capable of giving pleasure to the listener like choral music. Mr. Binyon testifies that certain performances of it heard at Oxford this year and last "" carried the audience away and created an impression of quite unforgettable beauty."" None will question the testimonv of so high an authority.
But classes of choral speech have been introduced into many of the- Competitive Musical Festivals throughout the country, and it may be questioned whether that is the most appropriate place for them. For the beauty of choral speech is a poetic beautv, not a musical one, and its technique of expression must depend on the avoidance of the characteristics of musical expression. The wisdom of hitching the poetic wagon to the musical star may be doubted. It can scarcely be possible to judge the quality of choral speech as a musician judges the singing of a part-song. Music is made out of strictly regulated pitch intervals and time values. The judge of the nartsong can say whether the choir sings the right notes in tune with a pure tone and with good balance betveen the parts. He can test the singers' accuracy in reproducing written time values and other factors of expression clearly indicated in the score. Over and above these he will keep a margin of marks for his approval of such matters of taste as are suggested by the terms ""Interpretation"" and "" General Impression."" But choral speech, *f it is to have any poetic beauty, must keep at arm's length all the technical processes of music. A ' sing-song voice,"" that is the approximation to the tones and rhythms of music, is the worst condemnation of the speaker. One has only to listen to a congregation saying the General Confession together in church to.realize how corporate speech tends to. become levelled to a monotone. The teacher of verse-speaking classes must, one imagines, expend a good deal of time in eradicating the monotone, preventing the voices from rising and falling together by strict intervals, and counteracting the tendency to let the metre of the verse take charge of the ensemble as time values control a musical ensenzble.
No doubt the skilled teacher understands how to cultivate this anti-musical technique, so essential to the beauty of spoken verse or prose, but the musician seems to be the last person likely to be a fit judge of an art so diametrically opposed in principle to his own. At an informal hearing lately one musician remarked that the male and female voices of a speech choir spoke a whole poem through in consecutive sevenths. His ear instinctively translated the natural pitches of their voices into musical relationships. Though the criticism was correct in itself it did not really touch the case, for the important thing is that speech should be at a pitch natural to each voice and not at an artificial or agreed one. If two voices naturally speak at the interval of a seventh the discord between them may mean everything to music and nothing to poetry.
Choral speech then must determine its own criteria, whatever these may be, must develop along its own lines, and above all avoid being treated as a kind of inferior or semi-articulate music. Let poets judge its progress. Musicians can watch sympathetically but cannot do much to help
in giving back the living voice to poetry save through the time-honoured process in which the two wed their "" divine sounds and mixed power employ.""",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS168504207/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=007ae6aa

BY POETRY
WAGNERIAN TRADITION AT
AlMSTERDAM
FROM OUR MUSIC CRITIC
AMSTERDAM, JUNE 14
Halewvijnl, a symphonic drama in nine scenes, with music by Willem Pijper, was produced last night by the Wagner Society of Amsterdam in the Mlunicipal Theatre. and conducted by M. Pierre Monteux. The production supplied the dramatic element in the Festival of the International Society for Contemporary Music. The music is to some extent, though not solely, of that type which the International Society fosters; the drama and the relation between it and the music is wholly suited to the ideals of a Wagner Society. It is founded on a national folk legend which nay be read as an allegory. Halewiin is a wizard whose song enthrals all womankind. The king's daughter meets with him in the forest and, though warned that to follow him means death, nothing will deter her.
Her maidens dress her regally for the adventure, and she goes forth alone. H-alewijn offers her the choice of a halter or a sword. She chooses the latter and artfully persuades him to leave it, a little carelessly, it seems, within her reach. While the King's daughter loves the artist, she is without illusions about the man, and, seizing the sword, she pursues him to his lair, to return triumphantly bearing aloft the head of Halewijn. You may slay the man, but not the song, Halewijn's mother declares; and so, though the King's daughter returned to-the castle just as the family were' giving her up for lost, and indeed deposited the head of Halewijn in the very centre of the family dinner-table, a vision of the wizard himself appeared above the King's seat, singing the immortal song which obliterates courts and crowns. Moreover, the song which the composer has put into -the mouth of Halewijn is no triumph of contemporary art; it is a tune, plain and good, and perhaps that carries the moral for the International Society to ponder over.
Those of us who are still good Wagnerians, that is, old-fashioned and romantic minded, could enjoy Halewijn frankly and without misgiving. Here is music fructified by poetry, or perhaps poetry fructified by music. Anyhow, the two belong to one another, and Pijper's orchestra is discreet, hinting at tragedy in eloquent interludes between the scenes, welling up round the more lyrical utterances of Halewijn himself, delivered in the rich baritone of Mr. Sydney de Vries, and receding to a mere thread of sound while the King's daughter intones rather than sings her contribution to the dialogue. Miss Lisbet Sanders-Herzberg presented both in voice and manner the pcrfect picture of clearsighted maidenhood.
Specially attractive was the distant musical accompaniment to the robing scene. The imaginative stage pictures, the rich costumes, and the ungarnished fashion of the dialogue set into the symphonic texture, all tended to recall the collaboration of Debussy and Maeterlirick in Pelleas, though the score itself, of which M. Monteux and the Utrecht orchestra gave an extraordinarily sympathetic reading, bears no direct trace of Debussy's ipersonal characteristics. Possibly it may be suggested 'that the story, which enibraces the qualities of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, Bluebeard,,and-Judith, with-the head of Holofernes in something of the atmosphere of ""The Immortal Hour,"" calls for a more robust musical style than that of Willem Pijper's choice. As a contemporary the composer is a little afraid of romanticism, but still he is subject to its spell. And this may be the interpretation of the parable. Contemporary music awaits a king's daughter who is not afraid.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS201926863/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=ceab4026

. .
MR. BLUNDEN'S STUDY
;HARLEs LAMB AkND HIS CONTEMPOR4RIES
By EDLMuND BLUNDEN. (Cambridge University Press. 7s. 6d: net.)
*Mr. Blunden has somewhere defined: criticism as* ""at its finest a secondary poetry."" If the suggestion is'soun'd,he wrote, ""then Lamb is probably -the chiefof critics."" Lamb was an .ess'aist -first, and Mr. Blunden is first a poet. It is im-' material. Both have brought to their interpretation of others.at once the intuition and the music of poetry-qualities: possessed by Hazlitt (for all his indiscipline)'and in our own day by Mrs. Woolf, -but by too few among professed critics. We can only wonder that Edmund Blunden has not written of Charles Lamb before; - wonder, and be grateful that, to adapt a phrase of Elia's, the two points are now miraculously co-united.
Illustration is well-nigh impossible. We can but compare Lamb's verbal explications of Titian and Raphael, even of Hogarth, with Mr. Blunden's brief impressions of the. Essays in a passage beginiiing:-
From them, as though from a scrics of novels -and. it is hard that Lamb did not for once act on Wordsworth's advice-a number of spirits or figuresbhaeve found their way into the hearts of. ,the English and Anmerican reading worlds.. Elia himself-not Lamb precisely, but dressed very much like Lamb in black, with ""' immaterial legs "" tidily gaitered-is not allowed to die; he stOOps along past every file of London schoolchildren, fearing to be taken for a governor,"" and is in every old college library, smiling at the erudition of this queer race....
(This is the Lamb of whom Mr. Blunden has "" formed a notion that he begins to be neglected."") And Lamb's recovery from .the paralysis that Mary's madness and his mother's death induced isso explained:-
Presently a deeper perception of the crisis grew in him, who had in childhood been more ready than most to shape himself to and beyond his restraints and privations. He saw the future in the light of the excellence of his sister, and thec happiness of his bzeing enabled to minister to tisat cxccliencc Thus rising from his desolalion, Lamb gently resumed some measure of his
p6 ast vanities.b --
It is then suggested-and the claim is a large one-that only this tragedy prevented his "" ripening into a masterly and continued accomplishment of verse, and ranking in authority,of performance with Coleridge and Wordsworth.""
But if Mr. Blunden, like Elia, dedicates no inconsiderable portion of his time to other people's thoughts, he does not nmerely, here at any rate, dream away his life in others' speculations. We read him because weare sure he will illumine much in Elia the essayist that we have missed. There is learning also in these seven short chapters. If Mr. Lucas has left little of biographical fact to be recorded, Mr. Blunden, approaching from another quarter, has turned over and over the books Lamb read, the books his friends wrote, and other less promising things in .books' clothing. Joseph Paice, of Bread Street Hill, merchant-Lamb's first employer-is revealed, "" his memory stored with poetic treasures of the Elizabethan era ""; Lockhart (who thought "" Elia"" good, but ""John Woodvil"" better) approving the ""Speci-
mens ; Coleridge and his friend together annotating the margins of Basil Montagu; and Lamb himself, for.on'ce out of temper, rebuffing an importunate Godwin. Mr. Blunden' is perhaps too allusive, too little precise. We suspect that behind the smooth succession of his apt phrases lies a mass of sources unexplored before-marginal . notes, letters, magazines, forgotten memoirs. But' in'Athe' critical passages-and ""the biographical element is mainly confined to the needs of. a critical., theme ""-this allusiveness, which shows a. mind impreg-nated with the Elian, makes for charm and sw~ifthess of style. If one- of Lamb's '2'minor arts"" was expertness in quotation, misquotation, and parodic recollecti6ih, one of Mr. Blunden's rmajor virtues .Js' that he-can merge himself with his subject, 'and yet forfeit nothing of his individuality. Lamb has been fortunate in his interpreters;, we'picture him, on that unknown and silent shore, varying one of 'his own tributes-"" This noble benefitgratitude' 'forbids me to. conceal their names-I owe to the kindness.of the most munificent firm in the world-the house of Cornwall, Ainger, Lucas and Blunden.

THE EXETER BOOK
N:EW LIGHT ON THE
MANUSCRIPT
TiE FXETER BOOK OF OLD ENGLISH
POETRY. With Introductory Chapters by R. W. CHAMBERS, MAX FiRSTER, and ROBIN FLOWER. (For the Dean and Chapter of Exeter Cathedral: Lund, Humphries and Co. 8 guineas.)
The Exeter Book is justly described by Professor Chambers in the introduction to this splendid facsimile as "" one of the most oessential documents of that remarkable civilization of pre-Conquest England, the true importaance of which in European history we are only slowly beginninig to realize."" The vernacular poetry in which the life of Europe in the Dark Ages was depicted seems to have been written down but seldom, and when written to have survived still more scantily.
England has the unique distinction of having produced four great codices, in Which some portion of this body of poetry is saved. It is only a tiny fragment out of a lost world of song, but it helps to give a mearung to many centuries which would otherwise be, in large measure, dumb to us.
Of these four codices, one in the Cotton collection at the British Museum contains the long epic of "" Beowulf."" Another, in the Bodleian, gives, us among much else the poems of Caedmon. A third, in the Chapter Library of the Cathedral of Vcrcelli, in Piedmont, gathers both poems and prose homilies.
THE REPRODUCTION
All of these codices had already been published in facsimile for the detailed study of scholars, when the Dean and Chapter of Exeter undertook two years ago the pious enterprise of reproducing for the first time the largest, the most varied, and the oldest of the four collections, containing some 30 poems, of which only two short passages overlap with verse preserved elsewhere. The task is now accomplished, and the collotype pages of the Exeter Book in the hands of their 250 subscribers give a,, clear a text as can be seen in the original, while the removal of the vellum strips securing the scarred leaves at the end of the book has revealed letters, surviving on the edge of gaps, which the editors both reproduce and print. Two of the leading Anglo-Saxon scholars, Professor Chambers, of University College, London, and Professor Max Forster, preface the text with historical and descriptive studies of the manuscript. while Dr. Robin Flower, of the British Museum, has produced some new palaeographical evidence for the dating and circumstances of the compilation.
As we now have it, the Exeter Book begins in the midst of the first of three great sections of Cynewulf's "" Christ."" It preserves for us the same poet's "" Juliana,"" and such eariier masterpieces. not yet assigned, as "" Widsith"" (The Traveller's Song), and ""Deor"" (The Bard's Lament), in which traditions reaching back to the fourth century survive the changes of language, and the legendary figures of Weland Smith and Wade of the Haelsingas emerge among characters dimly known to history. It gives us in ""The Ruin "" an Anglo-Saxon's visior of a Roman city, perhaps Bath, as il looked in decay; it gives us such elegies as "" The Wanderer "" and "" The Seafarer"" and the dignified, heroic narrative ol ""Guthlac,"" together with much else, such as the fragments of an allegoric bestiary. and a collection-of Riddles. Grateful as we may be for what we have, the editors emphasize the possibility that there may have been manv more poems in the original manuscript. When Bishop Leofric gave it to the Cathedral of Exeter, some time before 1072, it was described as "" one large English book on various subjects composed in verse."" Now it occupies only 123 folios of large and upright script, though an extra eight folios bound with the text give us an Anglo-Saxon list of Bishop Leofric's donations, a Latin abstract of this, and various unrelated legal documents.
BISHOP LEOFRIC
This preliminary matter is the subject of a detailed and valuable study by Professor Forster, while Professox Chambers tells us what is known of Leofric's life. The Bishop was apparently not English by birth, and certainly not English bv education, having his upbringing in "" Lotharingia,"" a term stretching from modem Lorraine to the Netherlands, After serving as Chaplain and Chancelloi to Edward the Confessor, he was appointed in 1046 to the combined sees of Devon and Cornwall, then held al Crediton, but obtained a charter from the King in 1050 to transfer his seat to the Church of St. Peter, Exeter, where there was more security against pirates. Leofric survived into the reign of the Conqueror, and died at Exeter in February, 1071-72. The list of his benefactions (which survives in two Old English and one Middle English copy) includes some 66 manuscripts. Of these the Exeter Book itself has remained at its place of deposit since the death of Leofric. except for twe journeys to the British Museum, once in 1831, when a most useful transcript was made by Robert Chambers and checked by Sir Frederic Nladden, and again in the past two years, in order that it might be photographed for the present publication, repaired, and rebound. Among its companion manuscripts in Leofric's donation nine can be identified in the Bodleian, three in the British Museum, and four in the University or College Libraries at Cambridge. There is also a Lambeth Manuscript of Bede on the Apocalypse (Lambeth MS. 149), which appears to have come from Exeter. This is used by Dr. Flower as first-class evidence for the possible origins of the Exeter Book itself.
Considering the script of the latter and comparing it generally with West Country manuscripts, such as the Salisbury Psalter, he dates it "" well within the second half of the Tenth Century . . - probably between 970 and 990, and rather early than late in that period."" With the Lambeth Bede he shows a detailed resemblance of hand first pointed out to
nim by Mr. Kenneth Sisam. Now this Lambeth manuscript contains not only the name of Leofric, but an inscription in an eleventh-century hand, stating that in 1018 ""this volume also"" was given to a monastery of St. Mary the Virgin, at a place now not to be deciphered, by a certain Aethelwvrduis Diix. Dr. Flower proceeds from this to make the tempting conjecture that it was the Exeter Book which was presented to this religious house by A ethtelwardus Dux with the Bede, and that Leofric brought thence the two together to Exmr. He points out that
there was in l01 an Aethelweard 1 Ealdorman of a district including Dorset, Somerset, and Devon, who- witnessed a charter of Crediton about that very year. Moreover this Aethelweard had married the granddaughter of a more famous namesake, who was his predecessor as Ealdorman of this district--Aethelweard the chronicler and patron of Aelfric. This Aethelweard the elder, a kinsman of King Alfred and an inspirer in the tenth century'of the revival of English prose, would be no unlikely patron for a collection of English-verse also. It is not difficult then to follow Dr. Flower's hypothesis (he would not claim it as more than this) that the book was compiled in a West Country monastery for Aethelweard the elder early in the period 970-990, and given in 1018 by his namesake and kinsman to Crediton or some other local house, whence Leofric removed it to his new episcopal seat.
Dr. Flower shows that, though serious study was not devoted to the Exeter Book until. Humfrev Wanley and George Hickes examined it in the early eighteenth century, two of the sixteenth-century pioneers of Old English studies had seen it-John Joscelyn, who took several notes from it, and Laurence Nowell, whose hand can be recognized in several glosses written into the manuscript itself. One further new point discussed'by the editors deserves comment. This is the existence in the margins of six pages of apparently unique decorations incised with a stylus bare of ink or colour. Among them are a rosette, a crossed D, an angel's head with wings, a woman's figure, a veiled hand, and a man on horseback. These very curious ornaments, probably done in the late eleventh century, have been reproduced most successfully in the facsimile.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS151332991/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=2b825521

Bishop Percy is now chiefly remembered for"" his ""Reliques of Ancient English Poetry."" But this, though his. magnuim .opust; was only one of many literary. activities. A scholar with several languages at his command and with all the antiquarian enthusiasm of his age, he published a translation (via Portuguese) of a Chinese novel and some Chinese poems, -more than one volume of translations from Icelandic, and "" A New Translation Iof the S.ong of Solomoi.!' His own ballad, ""'The Hermit of Warkworth,"" ran into -several editions in a few years, some of his verses appeared in Dodsley's "" Collec*tion of Poems,"" and when, later in life, -he gave up the study of songs and ballads as perhaps incompatible with the duties of Bishop of Dromore, he published an essay on the origins of the English stage and the historical plays of Shakespeare.
So much is generally:known, together with the bare fact.of:his friendship with IBowle, editor of "" Don Quixote."" It has -remained- for a recent gift from Percy's $reat-granddaughter to the Bodleian to prove, not only that Percy himself at one time projected a first critical edition of Cervantes' satire, but that in 1775 a volume of his own translations of Moorish songs actually reached the stage of proof, though it was never proceeded with. In the beautifully printed volume published in a limited edition Mr. John Johnson has completed at the Oxford University Press what was begun 158 years ago by ""'S. Leacroft, at the Globe, Charing Cross."" Percy 'had procured -designs for an engraved title-page and frontispiece, and these are reproduced from the original copperplates, together with three drawings for woodcuts by
Henry Swinburne. The text consists of the l four translations with originals which survive in proof, a fifth translation (of "" Rio Verde, Rio Verde "") which appeared in the "" Reliques,"" and two other renderings which, as the editor states, "" are so free as not to. invite compariso'n with the originals."" In a scholarly preface Mr. 'Nichol Smith discusses Percy's interest in Spanish literature (printing two newly discovered draft letters about the "" Don Quixote "" project) and attributes to him ,the position of pioneer in more fields than that of the study of ancient English ballads.- - -
The translations make pleasant reading, though they bear the mark of the eighteenth century clearly stamped on them. Percy was confronted with the difficulties of every translator of verse; but he was not blind to them and obviated many of them with a considerable measure of success. To' avoid the ., affected stiffness"" of a literal rendering he found himself constrained, as he confesses, to adopt in places "" a more simple epithet, though less poeticalt or expressive."" Too often, indeed, with the licence of his period, he departs some distance from his models, and introduces phrases *and*ideas-foreigxi to-their-spirit. *But if
*%ve say of Percy that he fails, for all hisl artifices-or because of them-to recapture the rugged and sonorous grandeur of the Spani,sh, this is no more than we must say 'of Southey, Larckhart, and of Longfellow.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS117647405/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=afdfa2e2

It was compiled and edited by Lauro de Bosis, who, besides being a distinguished poet himself and the son of one of the best-known lyrical poets of the last generation, lectured on literature at Harvard University and translated many modern English works into Italian, including a three-volume abbreviated edition of Sir James Frazer's "" Golden Bough.""
The Cambridge University Press announces a new history of Italy's struggle for nationality and independence, written by Mr. G. F. H. Berkeley as the result of a life study of the subject. Spending most of his winters in Italy the author has been in touch not only with State archives and libraries but also with those who could keep him abreast of the constantly increasing supplies of information. His book, entitled "" Italy in the Making, 18151846,"" is expected next month. The longer process of Italy's development through the centuries, with her contribution to the sum of world culture, is traced in another forthcoming work, entitled "" An Outline of Italian Civilization."" This has been written by Dr. Decio Pettoello, and will be published by Cassell early in the New Year.
The visit to London in 1641-42 of John Amos Comenius, the educational reformer, marked a memorable stage in the evolution in this country of the scheme for a great institution for scientific research, a movement which led some 20 years later to the foundation of the Royal Society. The details and significance of that visit are recorded in a work entitled ""Comenius in England,"" by Mr. R. F. Young, which the Oxford University Press hopes to have ready in December. Contemporary documents are included by the author showing that England was "" in the main stream of Western European civilization, and, indeed, was leading the advance on the very eve of the Great Rebellion,"" as well as illustrating the interest taken by Comenius in educational work among the Indians of New England and Virginia.
* Although the late Philip Wicksteed was most widely known as a Dante scholar, his more enduring work may perhaps be found in the science of economics. A new edition will shortly be published by Routledge, in two volumes, of his ""Common Sense of Political Economy,"" which marked the culmination of his devoted labours in this branch of knowledge. The book has been out of print for years and copies are at a premium. The new edition will contain an introduction by Professor Lionel Robbins.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS151725949/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=0a79872e

MAJOR ELLIOT, MI.P., Financial Secretary to the Treasury, speaking at the Scott centenary celebration at Hawick, in Roxburghshire, yesterday, said that in Hawick they would remember the guest of Branxholme and the ride. of Liddesdale. Here was the soil that bred him, here rang still the tales which were told him and which he told the world again. He was the very breath of Scotland that came from the moors, sometimes as a gift and someTanes as a song. What he got from the borderers was the strength to be serious. Lord David Cecil had truly said that it was by his power of tragedy that Scott must have his place. It was in Liddesdale that he learnt tragedy.
In 1792, when he was but 21, he crossed into Liddesdale for sevehi years. He took that road again. From this was born the minstrelsy of the Scottish Border and from this was born the poet, the man wvho looked into his own hills and saw through them to the other side of good and evil.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS135604012/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=b00b5894

GOETHE'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY. Translated
by R. 0. MooN. (Alston Rivers, 10s. net.)
All these books are designed, by their timely appearance together, to help us to celebrate the Goethe centenary with understanding. Dr. R. 0. Moon's translation of Dichtung und IVahrrheit reads fluently and comfortably, and it is now, some time since the last English version appeared. Professor Robertson's is an extension for the occasion of a work already well known; he may be said to be most concerned with giving us aii upto-date biography and literary history. Professor Barker Fairley, of Toronto, is almost entirely occupied with an analysis of Goethe as a poet: his is a thoroughly original contribution and shows an uncommon insight into the wvorkings of the Goethean mind. Mr. Felkin's two concise chapters, w hich may be described as mixed, suggest a philosophical clue to the heart of the mystery.
For mystery there still is for English readers about much that relates to Goethe; Professor Fairley, indeed, finds that a "" distressing vaguieness "" has gatlhered round his name; and in any case his genius wvas so large and manysided that it is easy to put the wrong emplhasis on this or that element in it. He is pre-eminently an author wlhose meaning is illustrated by his life: hence there will alvays have to be lives of him, and a full-dress life is bound to be copious. Taste, too, changes and affects our judgment of him. Gone is the generation to which Carlyle gave the injunction, "" Close tlhy Bvron; open thy Goethe."" The Byron hardly needs closing now, while as for parts of Goethe, such as IVerther and the Wahlverwandtschlaften, it is admittedly an acquired taste that is needed. Even Faust is pronounced by many to be in one sense or another a magnificent failure; Goethe either attempted the impossible, or lhe made an imnpossible drama out of it. But all English readers can admire Part I.; and to Goethe's lyrics they are prepared to yield the palm instantly. They can see that, like Slhakespeare, he is full of immortal quotations: like the Scriptures, full of proverbial 'wisdom. Of his wvisdom, indeed, a mere look at his countenance would assure them; 'Mr. Felkin, wvho recalls an appropriate passage, hints that Goethe may possibly have had abnormal optical powers; and in another sense Professor Fairley says the same, for in the Platonic cave, -as he puts it, Goethe by some dispensation seems to sit sideways and to see both the wall and the objects whiclh file past it. For the appreciation of this uncanny wisdom a good biography is essential, so much seems to rest in Goethe himself rather than in his country or in his times, for he can hardly bo said to be the great child of a great age as Shakespeare was. There are those who have been surprised, even pained, at the thought that so mighty a force should have been harnessed so long to a petty concern like the little State of which Weimar was the capital ; if so, it becomes all the more important to understand exactly what Weimar was and what Goethe did there. Professor Robertson appears to regret Weimar, as a cramping influence ; Professor Fairlev, on the other hand, holds that it was Goethe's poetic salvation.
When the complicated relations between the biography and the works have been set forth, as they are by Professor Robertson, and when something of the Goethean debt to Spinoza is acknowledged, as it is by Mr. Felkin, the present age, which sees in Goethe a poet more than anything else, ought to find Professor Fairley most stimulating. How is the yoTi-riKl pav-rEa to be accounted for ? Our guide is an enthusiast of uncommon insight. He begins by reminding us that it was as a worshipper of Shakespeare that Goethe made his literary debut; then folloved a succession of influences, many of them, as everybody knows, female, while others again were literary. None, however, dominated him ; he had
too strong an instinct for Entsagung and Beschriinkung; he absorbed as much as his nature needed and no more. He was essentially a lyrical poet ; lyric is the prevailing note of the Urfaust, wvhich Professor Fairley compares, as few do, with its contemporary Werther ; he was not cut out for long composition iike a Virgil or a Milton, and yet, such was its attraction for him, he had to spend some 60 years over Faust, so elaborating and enlarging the original fable until it became another Divine Comedy. Nor, "" fragments of a general confession"" as his poems in one sense are, was there ever quite such an unselfconscious writer: "" he is innately objective "" ; he sought for objectivity all his life; an audience has no existence for him "" the most nonchalant of authors, writing his verses as a matter of course, when he is impelled to m.rite them, and remaining unperplexed when the impulse deserts him."" A firm belief in Goethe's inspiration whenever he wrote leads Professor Fairley to some admirable explanations of episodes, such as the W\'alpurgisnacht. in Faust, often misunderstood by commentators, and to a full appreciation, often less forthcoming than merited, of the astonishingly rich v,ariety of metres used by Goethe, though Goethe troubled himself no more about nietrical theory than he thought about thinking. Goethe's poetic mind was, he insists, "" marvellously true to its kindred points-true to the self wvhich speaks and to the nature which prompts,"" and the scale of his being was fortunately large enough to let that fidelity have full play.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS268641917/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=349f760c

TilE OXFoRD BOOK OF REGENiCY VERSE,
1798-1837. Chosen by H. S. MIxftout. (bxford: Clarendon Press.> London: Milford. Ss. 6d. niet.) 1.
Betweeni the oclose of the ""Oxford Book of Eighteenth-Century Verse"" and the opening of the-"" Oxford Book of Victorian -Verse "" lies a period to which, as Mr. 'Milford explains.; it is hard to affix a satisfac' tory title,'but which eomprehends so great a production of illustrious poetry that it demands an'anthology at least as extensive as the others. Within this period the whole work of Shelley, Keats, and Byron (merely to name tho greatest) was accomplished, and, since the lives of these light-givers began and ended i n the times 'of George IV., we may aecept for praotical purposes the term of Me. Milford, now giving uS his ""Oxford' Book of Regency Verse."".
When one considers that the dovelopment of Wordsworth alone requires over one hundred of, lr. Milford's pages, and that the notable poetio art of the Regency era was as much embodied in long' and well-marshalled compositions as in brief ""decisive actions"" of lyric and ode, the main weight of our anthologist's task is recogiiized. But there is a secondary iiecessity and problem. In the splendour, the rapidity and variety of the most eminent Regency poets, the delicate jierfections of many poets ""of less note s, have been lost to view. Particularly was this true from the very beginning in the case of some beautiful but sequestered singers -as Hood, Darley, Clare-who flourished at a time when most progressive appreciators had eyes only for Shelley andEeats and the extension of their honour. Previous instances of Mr. Milford's e'cemplary bookmanship and fineness of response to
rhatever is admirable would have warranted us in anticipating that his Regency anthology solved aflike the problem of port-raying without curtailment the most powerful genius of that time, and the question of recalling attention to less powerful but perfectly expressed person. alities with their glimpses of the ""august abodes.""'
The result is in accord with such anticipations; Mr. Milford's selection will delight the general reader and encoutage the particular inquirer. The scope of the book does not disdain those passages of poetic humanity which a mistaken austerity of criticism often leaves out of the picture-familiar verse, wit and satire, in vvhich the Regency poets were almost as remarkable as in pure romance and intellectual beauty. No political incident or public 'quarrel passed in those days without a set of-ballads and pasquinades, and the clmax of those dexterous and certainly lyrical comments on this nether world was Byron. Inspiration from 'the topics of the news was never realized more fully'by poets of every degree. Mr. Milfbrd's inclusions on this ground are a salutary proof of the solid meanings of the romantic movement and the free hand which poets have'in finding themes. But we do not wish to make this point the head of our gratitude to 'the antholog-ist -
He has assembled a series of great and coherent 'poetry, 'the ethereal, the philosophical, the'pictorial, the musical, the iro ical; he has 'shown equally the triumph of C6leridge with the' kingship of Scott, the sustained -glory of Shelley with the impulsive.mystbay-of Darley, the rich depths of Keats with the clear current of 'Southey, the gay vivacity of Peacock with the intimate playfulness of Lamb. In his regard for the scholar-on whom the' general reader depends-he provides 'in structive references to the texts aind sburces of' his transcripts, and cannot but. give a- valuable direction to' those who, charmed with 'h first generous offerigs, long tog? farther in this noble region.

BRITISH ACADEMY COMMEMORATION.
THE CA :DMON 1MNU]spRiPT op. ANGLO-
SAxo2N BIIBLICAL POETRY, Junius XI in the Bodleian Library. With Introduction by Sin IsRAEL GoLNcz. Published for the British Academy. (Oxford University Press. London: Milford. Â£10 lOs. net:)'
In this stately folio, which commemorates the twenty-fifth anniversary of the incorporation of the British Academy, Sir Israel Gollanez sees a long-cherished desire of his fufilled. He is to be cordially congratulated on this, and on the form which he and the. Oxford Press have given to it.. We have here a full and permanent record of one of -the most important monuments *of early. English literature and pictorial art.
The Junius manuscript was written about. the year 1000, very probably at Winchester. Very probably, again, it passed into the possession of Christ Church, Canterbury; a ""-Genesis in English with pictures"" figures in the fourteenth century catalogue ..of the Priory library. In post-Dissolution times we first hear of it as in the possession of Sir Simonids d'Ewes, and then of Archbishop Ussher, who gave it to Francis Junius, who, dying in 1677, bequeathed it to the Bodleian.. It contains four Anglo-Saxon poems, which are known respectively as ""Genesis,"" ""Exodus,"". ""Daniel,"" and ""Christ and Satan."" The first three are paraphrases of Biblestory,ofvarying merit, the fourth tells of the Fall of the Angels, the Harrowing of Hell, the Doom, and the Temptation of Christ. The first poem is moreover illustrated with nearly fifty outline drawings, and there was evidently an intention to adorn the "" Exodus "" andl "" Daniel "" in like manner, for many pages and half-pages in them are left blank. The last poem, *hich is by a somewhat later scribe, was not meant to be illustrated.
Great and varied as is the interest of all the poems in the book-and there are no- other copies of them-the greatest interest attaches to the "" Genesis."" Junius, who printed the whole contents of the volume in 1655, believed that everything in it was the work of Caedmon, the inspired herdsman-poet of- the seventh century whose story is so beautifully told by Bede. But criticism, which began very shortly after the publication of the text, disposed of Caedmon's claim to have written the last three poems, and threw grave doubts upon his - authorship of the "" Genesis."" It became a question whether there was in the world any fragment of his work other than the nine lines which some nameless benefactor had written -on the margin of the venerable Cambridge manuscript of Bede's "" Ecclesiastical History,"" to which some would add the verses carved on the Ruthwell Cross. What is Sir Israers verdict on this most important questiont He reminds his readers that it has been demonstrated that in the "" Genesis "" there is a long interpolation from another poem on the same subject. This is an AngloSaxon version of part of an Old Saxon (German). Genesis-poem ;- in it are eontained those remarkable passages about Satan which, it has been thought, were known to. Milton. The interpolation is known as "" Genesis B,"" and the remainder of the text as "" Genesis A."" And we are glad to read that of "" Genesis -A"" Sir Israel-believes that Caedmon may very well be the author; though, as has long been recognized, the dialect of- the poem has been altered from Northumbrian to West Saxon.
Interesting again it is to find Sir Israel appro,ving the, fancy that the poem
' Exodus"" may be, if not by the great Aldhelm of Sherborne, ""then by one of his school, and certainly by a kindred spirit,"" and to learn that "".Exodus"" was most probably known to the author of "" Beowulf."" But we must not follow him through the whole of his fascinating review of the literary contents of.the mannseript. Only this remark may be permitted: that we. doubt if the theology of the last of the poems, "" Christ and Satan,"" is. in realitv. as unorthodox as he thinks it.
Something must be said about the pictures. They are not of the very finest style, but they are very spirited, and many of them-particularly those of the story of Satan and the Fall-are unique, for they illustrate a unique text. It seems to us probable that upon those which are concerned with the Bible story light would be thrown by the Greek pictured Octateuchs. The proposition may seem curious; yet it is provable that a German nun in the twelfth century copied Byzantine pictures by the score: we refer to Herrade of Landsperg and her book the "" Hortus Deiciarum."" The Cssdmon manuscript offers a curious example. Sir Israel Gollanez' acutely points out the occurrence of the symbol. of Aries, the Zodiacal Sign, in a picture of Enoch. He would find, if he looked at the Greek Octateuchs, that their practice is to represent Enoch accompanied by the Signs of the Zodiac, or pictures of the months, which he was the first to make known to man. The only other pictured Bible of AngloSaxon make which we possess is the Heptateuch Claudius B. iv in the Cotton library, which belonged to St. Augustine's, Canterbury. It has well over 400 pictures; it has some resemblances to the Junius manusclipt, and, irn our opinion, it well merits investigation from the point of view of a possible Eastern origin. Sir Israel makes one specially ingenious suggestion when he deals with an elaborate decorative design which fills a blank space on page 225 of the manuscript. According to him it is a design for the ornamentation of the binding of the book. That it suits such a purpose well is clear; the Oxford Press have adapted it on the cover of the volume before us. It is for experts in the craft to tell us whether or not the theory will hold.
We have not noticed more than a fraction of the matters of interest-textual, artistic, literary-which fall to -be treated by Sir 'Israel in his introduction. The sourcei of the "" Daniel,"" its relation to the poem in the Exeter book called "" Azarias,"" the question of the names of the wives of Noah and his sons, of the sources of the "" Christ and Satan""; on all these and many' other curious points much is said which can hardly fail to interest, and it is well said. -In one particular Sir Israel has failed to make his meaning perfectly clear. He has of necessity to deal fully with the question of the structure of the manuscript and the possible loss of leaves. We wish that besides explaining his view in words he had furnished us with sectional diagrams of the gatherings. or quires of the manuscript. These would have shown us, more clearl than words can do, what is the aetual *condition, 'and what he "" hypothecates "" (vve quote his word, but feel sure that'his use'of it is un'wonted). It may seem pedantic-for him and for us to dwell long on so technical a point as the make-up of a' book; but it must be remembered that we are here concerned with the unique copy of a difficult text, and that many theories about the integrity of that text stand or fall by the 'correct answer to the question "" Are there leaves nilasinlg. here ? In 'conclusion. 'we con.gratulate-Sir Israel once more upon s lont!desired; a-welcome, and a splendid pubhi'cation..",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS152378604/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=a2fda07b

.1r. JOHN MA5HFIELD spoke last night at the opening of the fourth Verse-Speakixg

'I'here was no such tradition in this country. 1'eople did not hear, and did not wish to hear, poetry spoken. Poetry had almost gone, but as long as there remained two enthusiasts and a plank there would still be a poetical stage. At the present time it was possible to see a play and never know from start to finish that it had been written in verse.
T'hey would not Qlnd better speakers in the world, he said, than the best of those at the contest, but he wondered what use was being ,made of those beautiful speakers. Perhaps, like the philosopher, they were reduced to speaking poetry In bod long after the others were as eep.

DR. BRIDGES-S
POEMS.
NEW SONGS OF AN
OLD POFWT
-NEW E1RSE WRITTEN IN 1921. By
RoBERT BRIDGES. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 6s. net.)
Experts have gleefully fought. and will continiue to fight, .vith andabout theveteran Poet Laureate. Aud the plain mau who loves poetry, shutting his ears to the din of learned Rbattle, sits comfortably down to enjoy whatever beauty of poetry he may find in Dr. Bridges's lines, be they Neohliltonic Syllabics, or Accentual measures, or William Stone's quantitative prosody, or what you -will.
Mid the squander'd colour
idling as I lay
Reading the Odyssey
in mn rock-gardeni I espied the cluster'd
tufts of Cheddar pinks Burgeoning with promise
of their scented bloom All the modish motley
of their bloom to-be
Thrust up in narrow buds
on the slender stalks
Thronging springing urgent
hasting (so I thought) As if they feared to be
too late for summerLike schoolgirls overslept
waken'd by the bell
Leapitng from bed to don
their muslin dresses
On a May morniug...
That is in Neo-Miltonic Syllabics. It is also the .work of an octogenarian ; and it is as fresh and as sweet as Cheddar pinks themselves. Convenient things, these NeoMiltonic Syllabics seem to be. Once you can use them like Dr. Bridges, you can write in them, in English, Greek, German, Italian, and French, a poem to your parrot, -as playful as it is learned, and a perfectly simple tale of how, when you were a small boy, you went for a very long, hot walk in Kent to visit an old cottagewoman Awho had the shaking palsy, and a war-time poem, "" The College Garden,"" which talks of nman like this:-
There is no beauty of love or peace, no joy
nor mirth
but by kindred artistry of contemplation
enhanc'd
decketh his sovranty with inmnortalitCes. Jewels of inmaginiation hath he. purities
and sanctities whereby he dareth approach
God
plenishilg his temples with incense of music in praise and lyric litaniies that call on Christ
his Destiny is one with the eternal skies : he
lietlh
a dream iu the elemental far vistas of Truth
inhaling life to his soul as the ambient azurous
air
that he draxvetlh into his mortal body un-
conscious
to fire the dutiful-desperate pulse of his blood.
Of Accentual measur6s the new book gives only two exaamples ; but one of them is that sonnet on Francis Jamnles which some people have been hoping to see again ever since it was first printed, more than two years ago. Of quantitative prosody there are but three specimens, of xvhich only the translation from Sappho will detain the fireside reader-not because he has any dislike of quantitative prosody, but because, like many another servant of beanty, Dr. Bridges is not at his best vwhen he is angrv or contemptuous. And besides these scholastically named sections, there is a part of the book which is "" all in recognizable old styles."" And here is an extract from it-the beginning of a poem called "" Vision "":-
How should I he to Love unjust
Since Love bath been so kindl to me ? 0 how forget thy tender trust
* Or sliglt the bond that set me free ? low should thy spirit's blithe embrace,
T'hy loyalty. have been given in vain, From the first beckoning of thy grace
Thlat made a child of me again,
Andl since hath still my nmanihood le<l
Thirougii scathe and trouble liour by bour. Anid in probation perfected
The explicit fruit oi such a flower ?
And the end of that poem is as beautiful and as fuill of intelligence in love as the beginning. I
Dr. Bridges's learning inl metre and prosody has. wre believe, frightened some people into the delusion that his verse is all learning and no poetry. The newv book cainot fail to persuade them that his learning is but an instrument of poetry; perfected and polished only because he too would something make and joy in the making.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS151591305/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=61a79c8a

A SEVENTH VOLUME. I
HUMAN SHOWS, FABt PHANTASIES, SONGS
AND TREFLES. By THOMAS HARDY.
(Macmillan. 7s. 6d. net.)
To-day Mr. Thomas Hardy publishes his seventh volume of lyric poetry. The poems in it number one hundred and fiftytwo; and the appended dates, or some such note as "" From an old draft,"" show that they include poems recently written and- poems written, or sketched out, years ago. Mr. Hardy is wise in not leaving to other hands th6 task of going through the still ungarnered poetic harvest of a lifetime, but giving his own final touch to whatever he deems worthy of preservation. The title of thle volume tels that it contains poems diverse in aim and in kind. There are stories in it ; there are httle songs; there are poems of what appear to be personal memories and emotions; there are studies of the aspects of nature, and there are philosophical reflections on the riddle of life. The collection shows once more how inevitably a poet Mr. Hardy is;
Any little old song
Will do for me, says one poem; and
I only need the -homeliest
Of beaztatirrings.
That is partially true. Almost, you would say, anything seen, heard, or felt turns to poetry in his mind'; but the homely is not his only field. And when he chooses the homely, he gives it, no less than the august and the profound, the stamp of his own mind in the poetic utterance which he has invented and which is his only.
Many of the poems in the new book, especially, perhaps, the majority of those which sing of the inevitability of death, will fall into their place in the bulk of Mr. HIardy's poetry. A few stand out, and wvill demand inclusion in any further selection that he or andther may make. Among these are the little group of poems about
ainter, which seem rather to make than merely to show winter. Another is this profound little eight-line flash of psychological insight:-
The tragedy of that moment
Was deeper than the sea, Wben I came in that moment
And heard you speak to me
What I could not help seeing
Covered Ife as a blot;
Yes, that which.I was seeing.
And knew that you were not!
We should choose also the poem about the jackdaws in the church-tower who heard the bells for the first time in their lives when the peal was rung at the Armistice:-
""I t means some snare
For our feet or wings; But I'11 be ware
Of such baleful thingsp!
And forth he flew from his louvred niche To take up life in a damp dark ditch,
So mortal motives are misread, And false designs attributed,
In upper spheres of straws and sticks, Or lower, of pens and politics.
While Mr. Hardy's mind keeps its bent towards the past (as both the personal regrets and the stories of old days in this volume show), there is evidence here also of his vigorous intellectual curiosity. Some of the philosophical poems take in relativity; and find in it, at least for poetical purposes, new ground for that kind of hope which was not wholly ruled out of The Dyn*8ts.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS152115572/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=1c5b47b6

THE LOST BOOKS OF ENGLISH
LITERATURE.
A paper was read to the Bibliographical Society yesterday, at 20, Hanover-square, by PRoESsoRs R. WV. Cwnio3ms, on ""The Losi Books of English Literature."" The lecture] pointed out how even students of the Latin and Greek classics (although their imagination was stimulated from time to time by the discovery, or the claim to the discovery, oi lost'works) often failed to allow sufficiently for the vast' gaps in our records.
With regard to English literature before the time of Chaucer, Professor Cliambers said that the proportion of loss had been beyond comparison heavier than in the case of the classics. Two great bodies of heroic poetry had flourished' in England, and the first had been almost lost, the second entirely. The first flourished in the centuries immnediately after the Anglo-Saxon settlement in Britain and dealt with traditions.which had grown up around the figures of the great ""Barbarian "" leaders at the time of the break-up of the Roman Empire: men like Attila, Theodoric the Great,' or Alboin. The second nourished in late Anglo-Saxon and in Norman tumes, and its heroes were Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Danish Kings and leaders, such as Edgar or Hereward the Wake. If these lays iad been preserved it was safe to say that ,hey would have proved to be of greater nterest than those homilies and lives of 3aints which bulked so largely in medieval iterature.
The lecture was illustrated by lantern slides if inscriptions, carvings, drawings, and fragnenitary leaves recording traces of the lost iterature.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS337581968/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=f64c9275

'PROFESSOR GARROD ON
MODERN TENDENCIES.
The recently-elected Professoi of Poetry at Oxford, Mr. H. W. GnARROD, Fellow of Merton College, gave his inaugural lecture at the Examination SchooLs yesterday. Mr. (Garrod, who had chosen for his subject ""' The Profession of Poetry,"" began with a brief but sympathetic reference to the death of his predecessor, Professor W. P. Ker, "" a man who hated the waste of wvords,"" "" a man full of poetry,"" who died "" young at seventy."" Mr. Garrod said that amid as our present difficulties he thought that there was no happier augury than the vitality of poetry and of the 8tudy of poetry. Turning to the modern school of poets, he noted that most of their verse was lyrical, its language pla., and its conception of the character of the poet different. "" The race of long-haired poets,"" he observed, ""'is-dead.""-
lTe did not pretend to be in fuU sympathy with the modern school ; he had a sneaking affection for "" poetic diction,"" a belief that one of the purposes of poetry was pleasure, and that "" very little affords permanent pleasure which has not some hold in ethics."" He would venture to suggest that some modern poets had not fully realized how difficult the business of poetry had become. Already one part of poetry, sonfg, which was the union of speech and music, was dead; to-day /a song wanted two men's work, and one of them did it badly. We had dropped from the unity of words, music, and dance to mere verse, and we were askiug now whether even verse was necessary. loetry must have its pains ; it was ai particular manner of expressing life, and its glory was in proportion to the greatness of its strife. There was a danger that the bizarre elements of modern civilization might gain on poetry and rob it of its essentials. Tho problem of converting the complexity of our material civilization into poetry was less easy than a good deal of modern practice seemed to imply.
I Aristotle bad taught us that it was the
function of poctry to elimnmate the unessential; the poet was the man with an eye for metaphor, who perceived similarities which escaped common men, and lie had also the touch of "" mania."" For the poet was essentially mysterious and "" bardic,"" and the guarantee of hxis veracity was himself.
TfE Ro0AnTc REVIVAL.
Professor Garrod turned in conclosion to the poets of the Romantic Revival and showed how Wordsworth, Coleridge, gend Shelley were each of them not only poet but "" that abject thing, a professor of poetrv."" They had their theories of poetry and conformed to them in their practice. The foundation of their theory was a bold sensationalism; the function of the poet was to preserve "" a more lively sensibility."" Poetry described things as they appeared to the senses ; its descriptions were at once less real and more true than those arrived at by the aid of reason alone; its effects were supernatural, because natural. It redeemed us out ot life into ourselves; out of all that seemed not to matter into a world, vital, organic, pulsating.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS253302350/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=cd9e298b
(BY OUR DRAMATIC CRITIC.),Satire,The Times,1923-Sep-19,"London, England","I SATIRE.--
HANDICAPPED FOR
DRAMA.
| MR. MAUG HAM'S COMEDY.
(By Outt DflNEAMTIC CnITaC.)
In the current Literary Supplement there are some suggestive remarks on satire as a literary ""kind."" I apologize for the intrusion, but catnot help avowing that the writer, in controverting the common saying, "" Satire is not poetry,"" does I it, in my judgment, too muchi honour. The
saying is absurd on the face of it, almost as absurd as the counter-assertion which the writer offers in answer to it, ""Satire is poetry."" For literary kinds are not classifications of art, but merely for convenience vwe talk, for convenience, of satiricajl or didactic or epic or dramatic poetry, but these divisions have' no tsthetic meaning ; thcre is only poetry. To say that satire ""is."" or ""is not "" poetry is. like saying that a duodecimo volume, bound in half-morocco, top edge gilt, is or is not poetry. Poetry may happen over any subject, as it miay be bound up in any volume. Flat ubi tcult. It may owe its origin as well to indignation as to love, to the bitter taste as to the sweetness of life ; but these origins aro not poetry, which is pure expirssion and nothing else.
.Nevertheless, there is a soul. of goodness in things evil and an element of truth in many an error. With a little good will you can read a certain sense into "" Satire is not poetry "" which will rescue it from its plight of sheer nonsenso. The sense, namely, that satire is not a favourable motif for poetry. For the satirist is the slave of his theme, and though slaves may be poets they would stand a better ehance as free men. Satire is a parasitic' thing, a "" functiofi,"" as the mathematicians say, of its subject ; it must stick fast to that or it will cease to be satire; it must maintain communication with its base, or it will be ""in the air,"" chimaera bombinane in vacuo. ""Who would not sigh if Atticus were he ? ""- but. if there had been no Addison, and Atticus were a mere Aunt Sally of Pope's imagination, nobody would sigh. Yet the quality, the poetry, of Pope's verse would be unaffected by the question whether Atticus were or were not a real person. For artl has its own life, follows its own laws, and refuses to be conditioned by subject. When the subject galls it, it simply throws its cap over the mills and goes its own way. That is why poetry is seldom pure satire, why it exhibits more often only a. ""satirical veins"" running through a richer material, the material of pure poetry. The Supplement writer is, of course, fully aware of this, as is shown by his remarks on the Elizabethan dramatists.. ""No one can deny that satire is a frequent and often valuable ingredient in the dramatists. . . . Some of the vitality of Elizabethan drama, its direct contact with life, comes from this- satirical vein. Jonson and Marston are full of it; most of the others possess it in varying degrees. Even Shakespeare has a great satirist in him."" Observe that no claim is put forward for drama as all satire ; satire is only an ""ingredient"" among others, a "" vein."" It is quite true that this ingredient, this vein, is of real value for its vitality, its. direct contact with life'; my point is that this direct contact can be only intermittent. Maintained steadily throughout, it would be fatal to drama. For drama must have its own life, cannot be rigidly shaped by that real life which is its'subject, must give free play to the dramatist's imagination.
I think we have a striking example nf this truth in Mr. Maugharn's new comedy, ,Qur Betters. But, someone objects, we have been talking about poetry, and what has poetry to do with a drama in prose ? The answer is, everything. The poetry we have been talking about is only a short name for all, imaginative literature, whether in verse or in prose. Let us call it by a better, because less confusing, short name ; let us call it art, and proceed. Mr. Maugham's play starts as a satire, and it illustrates the difficulty, indeed the virtual impossibility, already spoken of, experienced by the dramatist in maintaining that direct contact with life required from the satirist. The persons satirized are a particular set of American girls, the rich girls who buy titles in the European marriage-market. The dramatist proposes to exhibit not so much the turpitude-for he is a comic writer-as the frivolity and snobbishness of these loveless bargains. And the frivolity and snobbishness constitute the atmosphere of his play. EHad he kept to mere frivolity and snobbishness, we should have had more effective, because more accurate, satire, and certainly less disquieting drama. But probably we should have had the feeling of being sent empty away; we should have enjoyed Mr. Maugham's wit and cynicism, but missed what we all want in the theatre -a poignant dramatic interest. That Mr. Maugham will give us at all costs, and so finds himself driven by dramatic exigencies into turpitude of characters and incidents, after all. AWay, then, goes the direct contact with life of the satirist! For who will pretend that his Lady George is typical? Typical, may be, in her shrewd brains, her sheer ""push,"" her success in "",getting there""; typical, too, in the vulgarity and materialism of her idealsall fair subjects for satire-but in principles and conduct a callous, shameless monster rather than a real woman, to say nothing of a real American woman. She lets herself and her establishment. be ""run "" by a rich elderly lover, and abandons herself, not from passion, but from mere caprice or just to spite a woman rival, to that rival's young lover. When discovered, she nevar turns a hair ;: just brazens it out, and artfully secures not only a reconciliation with her elderly lover, but also with the outraged woman rival. A most potent character, to be,sure,
in drama ; but as a piece of satire, remotei from all contact with life, incredible. So~ wvith the woman rival. She exists merelyas a contrast in turpitude with the other; perhaps turpitude is too grave a word for this caricature of the grande amoureuse, who haggles over the price of the motor-car with which she bribes her young lover, and who, on discovering his infidelity, promptly marries him for safety's sake. The satire, in a word, has either retired in favour of drama or degenerated into burlesque. Our fair American cousins may safely remain undisturbed by Mr. Maugham's satire, and may say of it what Lamb said of Coleridge's metaphysics, "" it is only his fun.""",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS134550835/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=846409e7

Not only out of loyalty to Mr. Stebbing, who was Delane's right-hand man on this journal, but also on their own merits; do we welcome the three volumes of verse translations from Greek and Latin poetry which he has just issued. They are not altogether new, for the Latin and the Greek "" Masterpieces "" appeared not long ago, though they are here aigmented with selections from writers whom he did not at first attempt ; but the volume of Greek epigramis appears for the first time. They have occupied, he tells us, his leisure for the last ten years ; and were they to be considered merely as the achievements of a nohageriarian they would be remarkable. But they have received, as we happen to know,* due admiration on the only grounds that can be satisfying to one who essays such a task-.
I Mr. Stebbing does not strictly translate; he thinks the thoughts of these poets into his ovwn, and 'while sometimes the version (the result of his turning a passage over in his mind) corresponds closely enough with the original, it is often considerably expanded. This process goes perhaps to its greatest length in his treatment of Sappho, where, it should be noted, he does not neglect to handle the latest pieces recovered by arch20ology. His method has its attractions. For one thing there are plenty of close translations extant; and, for another, Mr. Stebbing's 'mind moves naturally on classical -lines, and if he thinks more into a passage than a translator would, his thoughts are not alien to
it. His stylc is ripe and vigorous, and his versification, if it has its peculiarities in
the way in which he treats the stress~accent of English verse, cannot be said to be any'thing but his own. It is impossible here to indicate all that his volumes contain, but some of the finest specimens of Greek and Latin poetry are represented. IDy no means negligible are the shoe, prefatory appreciations of the different authors. Here Mr. Stebbing always sys something just and stimulating, and he is not a slave to convention. IFor instanee, while perceiving why Pindar must have commanded thc approval of his- compatriots and contemporaries, be is still a little perplexed by the "" unqualified, modern literary appreciation"" of him. That, is candid, and classical scholars are not always so honest vwhen they recommend the literary qualities of the subjects of their professional studies.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS169546949/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=233c39f2

This volume bears out Mr. Chesterton's recent saying that "" the point about [Alice Meynell's] poetry, as compared with most modern poetry, was this: that she never wrote a line, or even a word, without putting brains into it; or, in the most exact sense, meaning what she said."" Her spare sincerity, her disciplined reticence, is one reason why the book is so slender. Poems on such themes as "" Intimations of Mortality,"" "" Time's Reversals,"" ""In Honour of America,"" "" The Laws of Verse,"" ""To the Mother of Christ the Son of Alan"" might have swollen to quadruple their size if Mrs. Meynell had been willing (as she never was) to raise the sluices of rhetoric a single inch. Some difficulties due to compression would also have been avoided; but this poet is worth the toil of discovering her Eecrets, and she can be simple enough when simplicity suffices. Take, for instance, these four lines ""in time of war,"" headed by Richard Hooker's words, ""Lord, I owe Thee a Death "".
Man pays that debt with new munificence,
Not piecemeal now, not slowly, by the old: Not grudgingly, by the effaced thin pence,
But greatly and in gold.
Besides the grave march of verse loaded with ample thought there are in this collection snatches of the author's lighter, most delicate music, which we hear, for instance, in the tiny ode to Thetis

Her naturaL Greek, and silver feet
In two pieces, ""The Laws of Verse"" and ""The English Metres,"" fMis. Meynell professes her faith that the measures of traditional prosody are not fetters but pinions of fancy. She values, indeed, the relative freedom of our English metres, "" tethered, uncaptured, rules obeyed ' at ease""' ; but the poet's liberty must acknowledge its bounds, and it is to the ideal of law simply that she dedicates some of the finest lines in the book.-

A NEW ANTHOLOGY.
A MISCELLANY OF POETRY, 1920-1922.
Edited by WLLIAM KEAtN SEYMOUR.
(John G. Wilson. 6s. net.)
When an editor prints two of his own poems in the anthology he has chosen from others, he puts a sword into the hands of the critic. "" By this evidence shall you be. judged,"" the critic might say, ""not only of your poetry but of your poetical sense."" The critic might be wrong, but surely he would be human.
It happens, however, that one of Mr. Seymour's two poems, ""Cesar Remembers,"" is among the best in the volume. The sword must be rendered to him, hilt f6remost, with all honour ; and if we could but quote the whole poem, most readersno doubt very wrongly, but surely very humanly-might be content to take on trust the remaining sixty poets of such a poet's choice.
C*sar, that proud man,
Sat in his tent,
Weary with victory,
With striving spent. WVhere the grey Chilterns
Coiled and slept
That hard-lipped Emperor
Vigil kept.
But Casar cared not
For dyke or wall, Faint and remote
Came the bugles' call; Soft in the shadows
He saw, and heard, A Roman garden,
A Roman bird.
The verse is hard and hammered, like that of "" Emaux et Camees,"" and the effect as immediate and sure. Some of the other poets are inclined to be vague. On a first reading we are not quite certain what they mean, and when we do discover it is painfully apparent that they do not mean very much. A touch of the concrete would make them different and better writers, and help modern poetry on its journey from promise to performance.
But Mr. Aldous Huxley, in ""Theatre of Varieties,"" leaves nothing to be filled in by his reader's imagination. He is ironic-Mr. Huxley never forgbts to be that-in describing his entirely mundane scene, where
Circle on circle the hanging gardens descend, Slope from the upper darkness, each flower
face
Open, turned to the light and laughter and
life
Of the bright stage.
And much play is made with the "" bill,"" its conventionalized names and hyperbolic allurements for ""Saturday night in Camden Town."" The picture is brilliant in detail, from the "" worldrenowned Van Hogen Mogen"" on the stage to the "" stretched gargoyles "" in the audience, hanging on the conjurer's patter. We all know "" Dobbs and Debs,"" and the terrible infant with its questions.
Another picture from life is Mr. Edmund Blunden's "" Country Sale."" But how different the subject, how much simpler. the outlook !
The strife of tongues even tries the auctioneer, Who, by the dealer smirking to his leer, A jumped-up jerky cockerel on his box,
Runs all his rigs, cracks all his jokes and
mocks ;
""MadAfn, now never weary of well-doing,""
The heavy faces gleam to hear him crowing. And swift the old home's fading.
It is like a page from 'Hardy, but we may be sure has 'een independently observed. Mr. Blunden can paint nature as well as man-nature in all her freshness:-
Primroses, howv we hailed their peeping,
Under the black-barked woodides creeping.
Mr. Richard Aldington's Muse is more sophisticated. She has kept her memory of the Greeks, and perhaps, less consciously, of Matthew Arnold. She recalls the song of the nightingale through many associations-but recalls it as vividly as Mr. Blunden the primrose.
There are several noble pieces here of Mrs. Meynell's last work, and they serve not only to put a final stamp of distinction on the book, but to suggest, more strongly than might have been expected, how strong was her influence on some of the younger poets. Quite a large proportion of the verses might be traced, in theme or craft, or both, to the indirect inspiration of her spiritual precision.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS252253218/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=b0e4e985

I A NEW ANTHOLOGY.
GEORGLIN PoETRY: 1920-1922. (The
Poetry Book Shop. 6s. net.)
Mr. Marsh, in a short preface to this fifth volume of Georgian poetry, replies good-humouredly to- the critics who have begun to question the wisdom of continuing these selections. Into that question we cannot profitably enter here. The increasing prevalence of anthologies of modern verse, very similar in detail and character, is a phenomenon in which poetry and economies are nicely entangled. It is for the poets to agree to them, if and as long as they will or it Pays them. It is for the critic to judge them irrespective of names and formulas.
A collection which includes Mr. de la Mare, Mr. Davies, Mr. Blunden, Mr. Armstrong, Mr. Freernan, Mr. Gibson; and Mr. Graves, all at their latest and best, and M1r. Abercrombie and Mr. Lawrence at their second best, is bound to be both a choice and convenient volume for those who do not read these poets at first hand. Three poems from Mr. Monro's "" Real Property "" (in our opinion his highest achievement), Mr. Nichols's "" Night Rhapsody "" (from "" Amelia ""), a generous choice from Miss Sackville-West's "" Orchard and Vineyard,"" and a new and admirable one from Mr. Brett Young's poems, do not lessen its appeaL. In addition we have five poets of at present slender repute, Mi. Hughes, Mr. Herr, Mr. Pellow, Mr. Prewett, and Mir. Quennell, to stimulate our curiosity, if not to reward it: urcrost,ifnttorwr
There remain Mr. Drinkwater, Mr. Squire, and Mr. Shanks, in whom, as it seems to us, the virtues and vices of Georgian poetry are satisfactorily enthroned and popularized. For although Mr. Marsh may justly deny that an "" insipid sameness is the chief characteristic"" of this anthology, yet that ""lack of inspiration and comparative finish "" which he fancies hostile critics imputing to his choice is a very constant rea}ity. Of such a charge certain of these poets are wholly innocent. Yet even so fine and accomplished a one as Mr. Freeman is not entirely guiltless.
TECHNIQUE AND PASSION.
So many of these poets, we are driven to ieel, are sensitive, tolerant, and talented. They could turn out agreeably finished verses to order on any concrete subject from a dog to a door-handle. They observe the small details of Nature with a
rindly curiosity and report of her with a dainty daring. They lavish whimsies and faintly provocative emotions upon situations Tn themnselves often :commonplace, but for the heightenled speech- of passion, of imagination touching the heart of things overmasteringly, we look almost in vain.. Mr. Freeman comes near to it in such a line as "" Now, now I am but thought kissing your thonght,"" but so often an accomplished technique serves only a lethargy of soul, and the necessity imposed through deficient power upon these poets of keeping us awake by crafty verbal surprises soon fails of its purpose. We weary of smiling our momentary approval of a- trick, and when the coquetry of conceits assumes the mask of mnocence, as in Mr. Kerr's
I lingered at a gate and talked A little with a lonely lamb,
our smile broadens into laughter.
As with a building covered with nicely trimmed ivy or crowded carving, we often thirst. in reading this book for something bare and stark and strong. Mr. Lawrence once could. give us it, but here he relapses into a whimsical soliloquy over a ""golden snake,"" and is diffuse. Mr. Abercrombie, who has the giant in him, gives us a poem often fine in rhythm and in phrase ("" My spirit drank my flashing senses in,"" for example), but in his protracted struggle after passion and imagination he wants ares serenity. Many others fail lamentably to reconcile subtlety with sincerity-the problem above all to be solved by the modern poet.
We have purposely stressed what we consider the grave weakness of many poems here collected-their talented triviality. The beanty and insight of the others is only more evident by comparison-; and it it good that such poems as Miss Sadeville-West's "" Evening "" and Mr. Brett Young's "" Quails ' should now speak to a wider public.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS302584705/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=346dee63

M1ODERN REALTSM AND
MORALITY.
AGE OF """"PROSE AND
TZING-BOOM.""
(By Maurice Hewlett.)
Mlr. Williams-EDlis in her book "" An Anatomy of Poetry "" (Blaokwell) does not, as she professes, anatomize poetry: that would puzzle her, as it has puzzled many a poet and many a philosopher. ]Rather, she makes a bold incision in Our corpus poeticum, and would have us believe that her klife follows a natural line of cleavage.
She believes that "" Georgian"" poetry, by which she really means post-belum poetry, severed by act of hers, has really been organically severed all the timeonly we did not know it. Having de. monstrated that to her own satisfaction, she then deals with her separated mass, poet by poet-one of them, by the way, being Mr. Sturge Moore: qua diabe a114ait-il faire dans cete gaItre ?
Now, though I am here to be convinced, I should say at once that Ms Williams. Ellis has not convinced me. She has left rme rooted in my old belief that her line of cleavage is not one of nature's but of critics' cleaving. I think still that there is but one differentiation of poetry to be made, which is-, and alwayswilt be, between good poetry and bad poetry. 6he may call that academic, and I dare say that she wvill. I call it common sense.
A more serious argument concerns both matter and manner. Mrs. Williams. Ellis says that "" Georgian "" poems
are the cspression of an attitude of mind which iS. strongly contrasted with that of the Victoriar,s. These modern writers were
brouRht up in an atmosphere In which the validity of certain truths and the adzirableness of certain virtues were assumed to be Felf-evident. -. . . They lived to aee these virtues, embodied in tho Prussian citizen, produce the late war. Some of them are now inaimed or blind. They thus learned pretty forcibly the horrors of a taken-for-granted morality.
A CocxNny Ruy=.
86 much for ethics; now for s3sthetics:-
They had further been brought up to a belief in the efficacy of certain literary doctrines. For instance, the suitability of certain poetic forms to the freatment of certain subjects . . . the *b;olute fatality to the success of a poem of the presence of certain poetic solecisms (rhymes like ""morn"" and *da?wn,"" for example). They lived to sce theso taken-for-granted formult produce-absolutely nothing. . . . If moral right and wrong had been obscured by for'nule, was it not possible that so had testhetic right and wrong?
The answer is that it was not possible. No lapse of years, no incursion of war, will make: ""omorn"" and ""~dawn""-snything but a cockney rhyme. No weariness of strife, nor post-bellum laxitv, can turn ""Thou shalt not"" into ""By all means."" Poets were simple, sensuous and passionate long before the late war, and the poets of to-day are not the first to knock chips off' the Tables of Stone, if indeed thoy are doing it. Wea do well or ill, as they write well or ill. But the canons o.f morality and of art are much older than Queen Victoria; and this much is true of the two codes in conjunction, that if you write disgusting poetry, it will, to that extent, be bad poetry.
Well, then, we extend the argument. Milton set out to justify the ways of God to man. But ""'Tennyson was even surer about the facts of morality than he was about the facts of poetry ""- was he though t-"" because, we should now say, he was a Bood poet and an amateur moralist."" Does it make you surer of a thing to be an amateur of it ? But never mind.
The difference, says Mrs. WilliamsEllis, between the likes of Tennyson and the poet of to-day is that this one
regards the facts of moralUty . . . not as tbinp to -be defended or attacked, but as things 'to be ascertained. Hence . . a great deal, of the alleged impropriety and nbsorption in questions of sex Of the modern poet. Hncne also much of the renlism of such writers as ltr. Masefeld and Mr. Lascelles Abererombie.
ThE PsEuDo.Swrms.
1Really, I don't know that our poets are more absorbed in sex than they'used to be; and when I remember Swift, I don't kuow that I can say 'that they deal. wit1 it mnore lealistically.' There are more pseudo-Swifts about than is healthy. I cannot deny an. apparent cult, of the violent, the ugly, the crude, and the unrestrained-forth from which, 1 affirm, good poetry will never come. WVe are not 'given many examples of modern realism, as Mrs. M illiams-Ellis camls it: a rather sticky one frolD Mvlr. Gordon Bottomley and one very absurd from Mr. D. Lawrence. This is what she calls ""verbal Puritanism"" in the latter poet:-
And if I never see her again ? I think, if they told me so,
I could convulse the heavens with mvhborror I think I could alter the frame of things in
my agony.
I think I could break the system with my
heart
I think, in my convulsion, the skies would
break.
I, myself, think that in his convulsion he says the same thing five times. It is not the laws of Sinai or Parnassus that he breaks there, but the law of good sense and the law of sincerity. WZrhat are you to do with a man who talks like that, except toll bim. not 'to be a -go0se t Mrs. Williams-Ellis doesn't think. him at 'all' a gbooe. On the contrarv, her comment is that "" Poetrv has conie back to 'what is sometbing like a Words. worthian care and meticulousness in the matter of language."" The adjective Eeems to me unfortunate.
After all that, Mrs. Williams-Ellis drops her cleavage and comes up to my own. WThen she says of Feste's song in TzefItA Night that it is Georgian in effect, she intends a compliment to Shakespeare. It fails, though, because she does not produce any Georgian lyric in the least comparable' with it. I do not say that she cannot-but it will take lher ""all her 'time."" Feste's song is unpremeditated art. I have said something of it and its companions in this p]e~e, and need not repeat it. They were the product of a lyrical age, just
s sprely so as the Border Bsallads were.
Whatever "" Georgian"" poetry may be,
it is not unpremeditated; nor is ours a lyrical age. It is an age of prose, an age of. Tzing-boom ! As for our harps, ue have hanged them up-somewhere. When poets, as our author says, are ""6aaertaining"" questions of morality, they are not engaged in lyrical exercises.

PENCILLINGS.
ON BAD POETRY.
STEPHEN PHILLIPS AND
THE SOCIALISTS.
(By John Middleton Murry.)
MIr. Clutton-Broek's recent reference to the case of Stephen Phillips brought two things to my mind. One was an idle disCUslon of badness in poetry which had ended in the safe and sound conclusion that the worst, like the finest, effects were wrung out of blank verse (Who was it, by the way, who, when asked for a definition of blank verse, defined it as the cornparative of ""'damn ba-l ""?) There began the usual rivalry- in producing bad lines of blank verse for the general derision. "" A Mr. lWilkinson, a clergyman,"" was, of course, exhibited. That is not a very bad line, really. It is hopelessly prosaic, no doubt, but badness in poetry is a positive quality; it is not the absence of something that ought to be there, but the presence of something that ought not to be. Bad poetry is not so much prosaic as hyperpoetical. The lines we remembered were, liko Wordsworth's, neutral rather than bad, and we were dissatisfied with them. Suddenly a silent member of the company said that ther worst line of blank verse he had ever read was:-
The mystic sweetness of a garden wet.-
It was, he said, by Stephen Phillips. The competition was ended.
* * * *
It might be worth while to analyse the positive badness of that iine. Even "" the mystic sweetness of a wet garden,"" for all the forcing of accent, would be better. But it would be hopelessly bad. "" Mystic sweetneass"" is 9 impossible phrase; we mnight even go so tar as to say that "".mystic"" is an impossible epithet in poetry at all times. At the best it is a cheap conjuring trick. In Stephen Phillips's line it is only a would-be impressive synonym for ""mysterious "" or "" strange."" "" The strange sweetness of a wet garden "" might pass muster in prose: changed into that blank verse it is made emptilly pompous by "" mystic,"" and the rhythm is murdered by the inversion, "" a garden wet."" But the explanation explains nothing. There is an enormity in that line which cannot be analysed into its elements: there is, in fact, a "" mystic badness"" about it.
The other association suggested by the name of Stephen Phillips is kinder to his memory. It is an incident which, it seems to me, has a signiflcance of its own. One Sunday morning in the early autumn two years ago I was walking in Hampstead, and I passed a group of people arguing in the open road in front of Jack Straw's Castle. Instinctively I slowed down to listen. As usual, they were arguing for and against Socialism. Thinking that nothing would come of it, I had begun to move away when my ear was caught by the name of Stophen Phillips. Instantly I was curious. What eould his name be doing in that argument? I pushed my way forward and saw that a fat man of about sixty was the dominant personality. lie had puffy red cheeks and small twink. ing grey eyes, which continually swerved away from a hot-tempered and rather dirty young man in spectacles with whom hoe was arguing, and roamed benevolently over thi company. With a podgy hand ho fingered a thick gold watch-chain; and he wore . an old. yellow straw hat. He looked like a genial and none too prosperous pablican' Aid I naturally concluded that he was arguing against Socialism.
But not at all. It was he who had mentioned- Stephen Phillips, for lie mcntioned him again. He had relapsed into a far-away look and a patient smile while he stood listening to the fiery young man, vho was obviously an extremist. lIe looked like one, and besides he violently denounced Mr. J. H. Thomas. for "" ratting."" WVhen he had done, the fat man said: "" I don't know anything about that. What I do know is that there was a man called Stephen Phillips. He was one of the finest poets in our time, and. wve let him die in the gutter."" He-said it quietly, without emphasis. Nobody seemed to care. The sense of the meeting seemed to be that poets were queer fishes anyhow. and you couldn't afford to' worry about what happened to them.
* * *: *
The fat man was a dittle disgusted. ""Perhaps you've never heard of Stephen Phillips? "" he said to us all. * There was no answer. ""Well,"": he sighed, "" he was a fine poet, he was, and he finished up by having to cadge for a shilling for a drink. We let him die."" Ile paused. ""I don't know anything about this young gentleman's ideas,"" he wqnt on. "" I'm oldfashioned,"" he said with a charming smile. "" I've worked hard, and I've read a few books, and I don't want my books or my little house taken away. But I do say there's something b- wrong with a country that lets a poet like Stephen Phillips die in the gutter. That's the kind of thing that makes me a Socialist."" He spoke so quietly that every one was impressed and silent, except the young man with the spectacles. ..
""Have you read Karl Marx's 'Capital' ? "" he asked the' fat man truculently.
""As much as I could, I. have, young man. A red-covered book.. I got, it gt home.""
""Well 7"" said the young man very meaningly.
"" Well,"" said the fat man, smiling,. "".I don't like it 'alf so much as 'John Ball's Dream.""'
* * * *
I do not know whether the fat man's account of Stephen Phillips's end is true, though he spoke as one who had known him in his latter days, and perhaps had given him the shillings. But it seems to me that Stephen Phillips's memory gains rather than loses by. the story. It is no small thing for a poet to have been regarded with such kindly reverence b;v an honest man, and to have become for him the symbol of genius and the misfortunes of genius. That achievement shoulfl weigh heavily in the scales against the bad line4 he perpetrated. For me, at any rate,, his, memory is indissolubly united -with that of his generous champion. For him' I have a peculiar affection. Perhaps he was ineffectual: perhaps it is the mark of the Socialist dreamer to prefer ""The Dream of John .Ball "" to "" Das Kapital "": but the quality of the preference .Is I somehow pleasant. And at any rate he was one of those unselfish souls to whom .

The anthologist apparently has relied chiefly on contemporaries, but the absence of biographical details makes it hard to say: and although those tliree earlier poets Harpur, Gordon, and Kendall appear, they appear for a brief space only.
For these three the English reader here and there has long had a kindness. There was a forest spirit about that giant backwoodsman, Charles Harpur, which swvept with grand power through his best poetry. His genius rejoiced in the storms that massed their fierce omens, broke in darlkness and left after them "" a quiet mind"" upon his hills. He is not well realized in the love sonnet to which he is confined .in the present anthologies. Of kindred inspiration and still more striking eloquence was Harpur's friend Kendall. whose two poems in the "" Naturc "" volume d6 not reveal his nearly fcrocious vigour, as
rattles over riven rocks The thiunder harshi aniid dry,
And blustering gum and brooling box
Are threshing at the sky I
Then Gordon, master of rhythms since pirated by poetical cheapjacks, florid at times but daring always, beat out his own path; wi'ielding, indeed, his long lines as a stock-rider might his wrhip. And in company with these it is not unreasonable to set Alfred Domett, whose thirty years in New Zealand inspired the sinigular and voluble poem "" Ranolf and Amohia,"" with such pictures as that of the Fountain Terraces:-
Such fairy work as frost alone Were equal to, could it o'erlay
With tender crust of crystals fairFine spikes so delicately piled-
Not wintry trees, leaf-stripped and bare, But summer's vegetation, rich and wild.
Of the many poets chosen by the compiler, nione reveals so definite an individuality as those now mentioned; but there is no lack of distinguished pieces, both of love and of nature. Facile lyrics abound in Australia-indeed, they do everywheie-but, on the whole, a radiant directness of deeper impulse characterizes these songs from the South. Mr. Souter, for instance, wrvites in homely words and rhythm:
The rime was on the barley-grass as we
passed the homestead rails;
A Darling Jackass piped us in, with hlis trills
and turnis and scales;
And youth and nlcalth and carelessness sat
on the saddle bow-
And Mary lived at Irlsh Lords, on the road
to Ivatnhloe.
But with a suddenncss pworthy of the elder ballad he closes on ""that stern word, Nevermore."" Nessun maggior dolore; true for all time, and ever a tantalizing mood for the best poets' expression. There are several other poems here which call for remnark: they leave that sweet wish in the mind (in the words of one of them)
to glide tlrough busy life Like some small brook alone,
That vinds its way 'mid grassy knolls,
Its music all Its own.

POETRY OF THE DAY.
THiE REALISTIc REVOLT IN MoDE:RN
POETBY. By A. M. CLAnRK (Oxford: Blackwell. 2s. 6d.)
Professor Clark is ""bewildered in our poetic Babel,"" but he has girded himself, gone hither and thither resolutely listening, and now he tells us what he heard. There were sounds, he records, of a violent reaction to refined art. They break down all the carved work thereof with axes and hammers. ""It is a quest for the .pimitive "" : "" The age- of humanism is gone."" This was the belief borne in upon him by the publicities of noise achieved lby much free verse, where once 'the. deliscate and stately music of Arnold aiid Heredia charmed the ear. Nor is it free verse only which displeasedAhiasense; the 'writers of traditional.verse are faulty- and slatternly, dodgiig rhymes with base ingenuity, wrenching language, coptorting rhythm.
But he is not a pessimist, or at. any rate not a confirmed pessimist. If he was, he could never have persuaded himself to read and to appraise the quantity of poetry, verse and worse to which his pages refer. If he was, he would have taken pains to choose specimens of "" worse "" in all its glory far more disgusting to ""A Constant Reader"" and ""Laudator"" than those he gives. His are mild to the first one which I have at at hand:-
by god i want above fourteenth
fith's deep purring biceps, the mystic
screech
of Broadway, the trivial stink of rich frail firm asinine life
(i pant for what's below. . . . &c.
And, indeed, he hardly seems confident of the extent to which the "" Whitmaniacs,"" as he calls them, are representative of modern poetry. His statement "" This revolt is in many ways more apparent than real,"" though countered by another, ""In all the arts, poetry included, we are misled by new artistic aims, definite only in revolt,"" is to be observed in this connexion. Or again, one finds him on one page distressed 'at ""our poets, too conscious of themselves to be completely sincere ; on another saying, ""What we have to be thankful for above all is the abundant sincerity of our poets.""
The truth is, I believe, what Professor Clark has been at moments inclined to think-the revolt is nothing very terrible. Much of the vers libre which forms the official organ of the renegadosc is scarcely more than vers de aoietAe ; the Person- of Quality would no longer revel in feminine rhyme but in the most sordid, the most ferocious, the most shapeless outcry (warranted harmless). "" London Lyrics"" should no longer run
This is Mabel's window-pane;
These are Mabel's roses... ibut
Stop, driver ! Bump I The identical I The very place !
The magnolias recount the assignation pianissimo, and so on, freely. But such things do not affect the few beautiful poems that have been written in novel
forms, nor the relation of those achieve-' ments to the body of contemporary verse. They are one phase of the inevitable "" period "" of our verse, a small rare flower ; meanwhile, among the countless attempts, in traditional form, that happen every year, not a few additions are made to the English treasury of poetry. The younger poets are men for the most part well versed in the best of their forerunners and jealous for their fame ; at worst, as Professor Clark in one. of his kindlier moments says, they are only "" trying to establish a compromise between the Whitmanists and the old loyalists.""

LATE AND EARLY
LYRICS.
A DUALITY OF SELVES.
LATE LYRics AND EARLiER WITH xM&Y
OTHER VEBsEs. By THomAs HARDY. (Macmillan. 7s. 6d.)
One of the poems in this book begins:In a heavy time. I dogged myself
along a louring way,
Ti my leading self to my following self
Said: ""VWhydo you hang on.me
So harassingly?""
The leading self is one who feels and dreams ;. the following self is a matterof-fact fellow who dislikes illusion and distrusts feeling. In word and movement, and subject and sense, this poem, ""1He follows himself,"" is right Hardy, and, up to a point, it is shrewd self-criticism. There are always the two Hardys : one acutely sensitive to joy and pain, both his own and others', and one ever shrinking back from feeling into cold thought, because joy: is brief and chancy, and pain is sure. There always have been the two selves * for in "" A Young Man's Exhortation,"" a poem of 1857 now first printed, we see them at loggerheads, with the leading self bearing it off in the end.
If I have seen one thing
It is the passing preciousness of dreams;
That aspects are within us ; and who seems
Most kingly is the King.
Both selves are poets, and so readily and wholly poets that the tiniest incident, or even a day with no incident in it, can open in one or other of them the reserves of being and the passion for singing. When the two work together, then comes Thomas Hardy's finest poetry. One secret of the greatness of "" The Dynasts "" is that in it the leeIding self could tell his huge passionate story in harmony with the following self's logic, and the following self found his logic lit to splendour by the passion of the leading self. Often the duality gives us that sort of amcabman poem well known to students of Hardy. Here is the first verse of a new one
-When friendly summer calls again, Calls again
Her little flfers to these hills,
We'll go-we two-to that arched fane of leafage where they prime their bills Before they start to flood the plain
With quavers, minims. shakes, and trills.
""-We'll go,"" I sing; but who shall say What may not chance before that day I
And sometimes the following self has things nearly all his own way.
But the outstanding and delightful impression which a first study of this new volume leaves is the power of the leading self. The first poem in the book contrasts good weather with bad. And, if the poet shuns the w et and the cold, he thoroughly enjoys the experience of shunning it and the power in his craft vhich can turn the experience to beauty. A stronger instance is.easy to find. In "" Penance,"" a pale, thin man sits playing on an old harpsichord, to which he would not listen when a dead woman had played
it:-
I do to-day
What I would not then ; and the chill old keys,
Like a skull's brown teeth Loose in their sheath,
Freeze my touch; yes, freez.
For all its grimness, that is not the work of the following self, the denier: it is the work of the leading self, the affirmer, with his sensitiveness, his biting imagination, his intensity. of experience and of utterance. Every now and then in this new book -there comes a touch of that crabbedness which shows that this poet works not through sound to sense but through sense to sound, and does 'not always push right through to his end. Making for beauty first of all by exact adaptation of words to thQught.and feeling, he is more, perhaps, than most poets at the mercy of his own leads of vitality; for should his feeling or his vision flag, he cannot cover up the droop with decoration. And to watch hima working in this way is to see how very great are his vitality, his apprehension, his intensity; how much of positive delight in experience there is in him, for all his regrets, his fond loyalties to the past, his tenderness towards all sufferers, trees, birds, men, women. From this new book we- learn once more that he can sing as purely as a boy (""First or Last"" is one of. the sweetest little songs that he has ever macde), and tell strange and tragical tales; can. achieve, by his own method of precision, sudden suggestions of immeasurable greatness, or flashes of description so vivid that they all but make one jump, and can weave his own music, like no one else's, now involved and recurrent, and now as clear and sweet as a quick stream, using words that no one else has dared to use in poetry, and rhythms that no one else has lit upon-all by means of the force of his apprehension and imagination and the power in him that must turn to poetry whatever he thinks or feels.
There is an."" Apology "" prefixed to these poems. The following self wrote a good deal of it; and only the following self would have bothered to reply to the nonsense whereby people have tried to make Hardy out the versifier of a borrowed pessimism. But the following self gets in a neat little bit or two.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS269816503/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=ce8aac77

LANDSCAPE IN
VERSE.
18TH CENTURY
POETS.
I (By Edmund Blunden.)
There have been of late signs and rumours enough of a new-critical enjoyment of eighteenth-century poetry. The attention of book-collectors,. bibliographers, and anthologists appears, perhaps through the evident overcrowding in the earlier fields, to be tuming to that one; and for the mere luxury and love o0 (to say the least) a pleasing poetical content in the delightful dress of the eighteenth-century quartos, no excuse is ehneeded.
Whether the research that is now in full cry will succeed in adding unto us poets Iand poems of startling appeal, overlooked lir the swarm of contemporary publicists t or by the vagaries of taste, is too hazardous a question even for a 'wide solution. This may be said, that it will increase the pleasures of reading that are available without the' help of special collections.
The chances are that the poetical status of the times of Pope and Prior, Thomson and Gray, will not be. sen|sationally revised; but equally we have Ithe prospect of happy modest flights of fancy, social and amicable trifles turned with the neatness that is a little lower than genius, and pastorals not the less alluring because Celia treats Strephon with considerable coolness on an English upland, and there are footnotes explaining that the solan-goose is "" An aquatic bird, on.'.the eggs of which the inhabitants of St. Kilda, another of the Hebrides, chiefly subsist.""
RURAL VIGNETTES.
One characteristic, a lovable characteristic, of the eighteenth century, familiar to those who find their recreation; if not their spiritual refreshment, in the treasurehouses decreed by Robert Dodsley' in Pall Mall, or Geo. Pearch after him, will for various reasons puzzle the anthologist precisely how to represent it. It is the habit, amounting to a peaceful passion, of doting on landscape, and of painting it in words. The effect is that of water-colour, for the most part.
The anthologist's difficulty will lie in the facts that the verse which I speak of in itself is not so various, since it deals principallY witb quiet rural scenery in the one way; and that it often occurs, like a prospect between rows of houses, in the midst of a lengthy and ephemeral poem, a bright interim. Those evergreen pieces, Matthew Green's "" The Spleen "" and John Dyer's "" Grongar Hill,"" can scarcely be denied their 2place, and they indeed record, mn unp?retentious and yet almost perfect colouring, the English scene at large. The brown fallowvs still keep their Sabbath, as thev did for the Or,lske, ,-lr,+. 9+;n X
the clover, pea and bean Vie in variety of green. Dyer's hilltop still gazes
Where the evening gilds the tide-
How clse end sinall the hedges liet
What streaks of meadowvs cross the eye!
But the full contemporary sway of a kindred enchantment will be difficult to convey in a selection'based on poetic intensity. t b
Even thonigh the writers preserved in Dodsley and other repositories were what they have been admitted to be, imitative, and settled in some humble smallholding at the foot of the poetic mountain, there was a skill and there remains a sweet means of contentment in their easygoing verses. The pleasure that they had I genuinely felt is pleasure still, an innocent brightness. The eighteenth-century mind, that had no illusions of its being associAted with the etemals, found life agreeable; wished to say so; took, therefore, such a topic as ""The Valetudinarian"" or ""Wisdom,"" and, remembering Milton, said so in verse.
FORGOTTEN SINGERS..
The result was probably an exordium banishing the antipodes of the matter""Hence, Disease and pining Pain,"" or ""Hence, simpering Folly, hence,"" and then, after the just allowance of unwvanted personifications, the invitation, "" But come, thou Goddess boon and young."" Till, presently, the ai.thor has arrived at his especial rural scene,-
The bleating flocks; the lowing kine;
The smoking- cots, and pointed spires, The setting sun's reflecting flres; Woods dark waving in the dale;-
Rays which gleam; and clouds which sail; Shades and lights by turns contending; Gradual colours softly blending...
Thus, Dr. Marriott, who published one volume of poems. One may readily find a rval admirer from Dodsley's six volumes or Pearch's four; ""- Esq."" (Dr. Marriott's name itself is nowadavs scarcely more enlightening), is certainly no less of a lover and rather more of an observer. Who would not acknowledge the plain, the delicate truth of some lines in his poem "" Vacation "" (which informs us indirectly by its "" Aroint thee "" at the outset that - Esq. was a law stur dent) ?:
Soon as ev'ning clouds have shea
Their wat'ry stote on earth's soft bed, And through their flowing mantles thin Clear azure spots of sky are seen,
I quit some oak's close-cover'd bow'r To taste the boon of new-fallIn show'r To pace the corn-field's grassy edge,
Close by a fresh-blown sweet-bri'r hedge; 'While at every green leaf's end Pearly drops of rain depend,
And an fmrtlby iragrance round
Rises from the moisten'd ground. Sudden a sun-beam darting out
Brightens the landskip all about,
With yellow light the grove o'erspreads, And tips with gold the haycock's heads: Then as mine eye is eastward led, Some fair castle rears its head,
Whose beight the country round com-
mands,
Well-known mark to distant lands,
There the windows glowing bright Blaze from afar with ruddy- light
Borrow'd from clouds of scarlet dye, Just as the sun hath left the sky.
In the present state of poetry, the rural theme is frequent, but we do not often meet with the eighteenth-century's landscape-drawing there. Perhaps it would not be too much in the laudator spirit to say that we are not so appreciative of the lie of the land, the order of tilth and tithebarn, pond and sheepwalk, the embattled wood and the emhosomed*lodge-house, as was that age. The eighteenth century was its own best critic, and in its own best octosyllables laughed its foible to the blush, its ha-has, its Chinese temples, its dumpy statuary, its waters winding

DISAFFECTION.
FORM AND PHOBIA.
(By A. Clutton-Brock.)
Thlo Victorians, especially the Victorian poets, were guilty of an offence that now seems unpardoniable: they wore their hearts on their sleeves. Their poetry was all poetry of the affections, and disgust Played but a small part in it. For them it was a virtue, as wvell as a delight, to like things ; and they were never ashamed, they were evenl proud of simple feelings aroused by such objects and events as have aroused them all tlhrough the ages.
Sianburne in his youth seemed a dangerous rebel; Meredith, always and especially in his verse, was held to be perverse and difficult; but both of them, really, wore their hearts on their sleeves, like Tennyson and Browning. "" Love in a Valley,"" for instance, is one long surrender to the tender passion, that same old tender passion to whiclh the Song of Songs surrendered itself. Swinburne cursed, at times, iu a simple primitive way, but he preferred to bless ; and evei' his cursing was a -kind of negative llessing; you could see what he loved in what he hated and the music was always the same. As for Tennyson-well, he was utterly naked and unashamed in the expression of his affections ; and so was Browning. Both of them rush to beautiful and pleasant subjects with an eagerness that now seems indecent. They are never anxious to face the hideous facts of life ; they prefer the other kind.
No one can deny that they had their artistic defects. It seems to us now that they had a habit of saying more than they felt and that this habit got into the ,very sound of their verse. Their cadences were obvious, and sometimes they remind us of the throaty tenor or the languishing violin-
That even the weariest river
NVinds somewhere safe to sea.
How very weary that sounids; and how plainly you can hear the singer sliding down to an expected close in-
0, for the touch of a vanished hand And the sound of a voice that is still.
We cannot understand now how anyone could write anything so obvious as that, both in sound and in sense; and Browning, in ""The Lost Leader,"" is no less obvious. There, too, you can hear the voice rising in manly indignation; and falling more in sorrow than in anger; there is not a young poet writing now who would give himself away so simply. Certainly their poetry is all terribly tuny, as Wagnerianis used to say of Mozart a generation ago; and they would abandon themselves to their tunes like Venetian Gondoliers in moonlight.
PoErTuy or DISLI,D.
Now it all seems so far off that people psychologize about it; they explain how the Victorians disguised the workings of the sexual instinct in themselves, but they are not aware that one can also psychologize about the poetry of to-day, much of wbich seems to express nothing but a series of phobias. It is an interesting question both aDsthetic and psychological, whether it is possible to write poetry only about what you dislike; and the attempt is now being made by many young poets. Repression betrays itself in their form no less than in their content. Not only do they refuse to write about anything which has been the subject of poetry in the past, but their very refusal sounds also in their verse, or in that avoidance of verse which is called vers libre. The name is not a good one; for there is nothing free about most of it. Freedom is positive; but, in purpose and in form, much vers libre is negative; it is an avoidance of every rhythm and cadence, in which former poets have expressed positive feelings. You can see the writer incessantly flinching away from the obvious, rejecting the tunes and the emotions that offer themselves, like a jaded Sultan in his seraglio; and this gesture of rejection, repeated with growing impatience, is all that he has to offer in the way of poetry. The result is pathologically rather than artistically interesting.
Meanwhile the expression of positive feelings is left to the vulgar. The task that was once worthy of Mozart and Keats is now performed in music-halls and draw:ng-room ballads. The artist smiles enig-
natically at it all; but about what? fter all these phobias and refusals and repressions, what positive thing remains. Behind their dislikes what do they like ? That, finally, is what we wish to know of a poet or any kind of artist; and he must not incessantly take cover in irohy about the absurd affections of other people. Sooner or later he must come out into the open and express his own affections to us. Already we grow tired of this poetry, and all this art, that is merely disaffected. There is nothing intrinsically interesting in dead cats and cigarette ends, nor shall we wish to hear about them for ever, merely because the Victorians gave us a little too much of lovers and moonlight. The danger ahead, in fact, is a too violent reaction; and I expect the next generation of poets to outdo the Victorians in sentimentality and simplicity. Someone will discover that Haynes Bayley was a great poet, and "" She wore a vTeath of roses "" will be the pattern for the most advanced verse. Those who turn too violently from sweets to unsavouries will rush back to yet sweeter sweets to get the taste out of their mouths.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS302322337/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=580a1fc6

-L
ENGLAND I'N POETRY.
Here perhaps is a ""gift-book"" that many have been looking for at this season. It has several qualities to recommend it; it is neither new nor old; it ought to be as acceptable to the general as to the highly critical; it is well printed, and, above all, it is cheap. We have only one misgiving about it, though the misgiving vanishes when we have explored its pages; but at first sight the title, POEms oF HoXE AND OvausEAs: Compiled by Charles Williams and V. H. Collins (Clarendon Press, 3s. net), may put too hasty bookbuyers off the scent. But it accurately describes the contents, for most of the poems in this anthology are about England and the rest are about English lands overseas.
Let not those who insist on saying Britain for England grow indignant; for the greater includes the less, and the English language holds all together. Although Coleridge wrote "" 0 dear Britain, 0 my mother isle,"" he is in the minority, and of our latest poets few, except Mr. Doughty, have chosen to stray from the patriotic tradition sanctified, if not begun, by Shakespeare, and continued, through a long succession, down to the days of Noyes, De la Mare, Flecker, Brooke, and Cripps. By quoting some of the living names we wish to indicate at once that besides the old there is plenty of new or recent poetry in this volume ; and it is the judicious and yet liberal inclusion of writers whose copyright has yet years to run that gives half the charm to this collection. The other day a modern versewriter made an attack on the compilers of anthologies, not for what they omit, but for what they desire to insert: he argued that to obtain a place in an anthology does a contemporary writer more harm than good, because the public is thereby led to think that he has written nothing else worth reading. But to those who cannot be expected to buy volume after volume as they come out and yet wish to know something of the better products of the modern English muse, an anthology like this is of real service. It is supplemented, but not dominated, by the classics ; im fact, nobody here dominates or overshadows anybody else ; from Chaucer to the latest of them all meet sub specie sodalitatis.
So taking the established great on trust, thankful that they are there, and that, all told, they are in the majority, and not repining if certain favourites are missing, we may judge this collection rather by the living writers to whom the two editors gave a place. The first thing to rejoice over is the inclusion of several pieces frequently quoted, but not always easy to find; for instance, Newbolt's ""Clifton Chapel,"" Q.'s "" Alma Mater,"" Bowen's ""Forty Years On,"" Davidson's ""Runnable Stag,"" Belloc's "" South I Country,"" and Cripps's "" Essex."" Happily
there are no war poems, and perhaps only one or two which show the influence of the war; nor is the Imperialist note pro| nounced, but when it is sounded it is
heard not materially, but spiritually, as in -Sir A. Conan Doyle's "" Frontier Line,"" which for all its deliberate imitation, is a decided improvement on its German prototype. The next thing to be glad of is the high standard which the editors have demanded of their contemporaries: they are believers in form, and show preference for the memorable. Naturally there are some inequalities, but on the whole a distinct family resemblance is maintained, and much the same features can be traced among the older representatives of the family.
And what are these family characteristics ? Among them, no doubt, are love of country, national pride, loyalty to hearth and home, and delight in natural beauty; but these qualities do not by themselves altogether set the tone. We must add at least cheerfulness, good humour, and an occasional propensity towards individual oddity. The effect that these excerpts make on the mind is akin jto that made by Edward Thomas's i anthology, though that was mostly prose; England is, on the whole, a cheerful place, and despite a modern wistfulness, absent 'from the older writers, and suggesting history learnt and responsibility realized, the English are yet a cheerful people, even when absence from home tinges their thoughts with sadness. They do not take their sorrows too seriously; at any rate, there is no moping or frenzy in these pages; much more often does the sense of humour lie a close neighbour to melancholy. The editors, we should say, are in broad agreement with Thomas's reading of the English character; and consequently we find more than one specimen of his poetry here, and well does it deserve to be handed down. So, for all its strangenesses, does Mr. Doughty's "" Muse of Britain "" merit publication, apart from its original context. But selection becomes too invidious. A word must be added about the arrangement of the extracts ; they fall into five sections:-In praise of England, Merry England, the English Land, Places, and Overseas. The last section contains little work by actual oversea authors; but that little is often on our lips and quoted in our newspapers.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS186061207/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=5927dfa2

RECENT WORK IN
FRANCE.
POETRY AND ROMANCE.
By M. EDMOND JALOtX.
If we ex2amine the state of French literature as a whole since the armistice we see that it reveals characteristics which are not very different from those of politics. I mean that the opposing tendencies which are to be remarked are; on the one hand,- a definite -wish to return to classicism and the spilit of tradition, and, on the other, a desire to upset& everything and re-create everything anew, even sy,rntax and almost language-briefly, an Extreme Right and an Extreme Left.
It seems to me that in England the latter is more familiar than the former. I have read, from tiime to time, more than one article which praised the tendencies of the advanced' school, with a v1isible -contempt. for the rest. For t,wenty years- there has been- an inclnation to regard every literary and artistic I*Work simply from the point of view of its novelty, and to consider that its essential quality consists in saving what
as not yet- been said. One should be on -one's guard against such a point of view as against a regular disease of the spirit, otherwise one quickly arrives at incoherence and foolishness. It is especiaUy necessary to remember that the characteristic quality of the French minid is its balance, tiat is, the gift which it possesses of arriving at a mean between actions violently contradictory. In the present case, it vill certainlv succeed in giving a classic life to literary elements of the most turbulent and disturbing lkind. If it were not for the revolutionaries, our writers enamoured of classicism would soon arrive at vain repetitions and sterility;, if it were not for the classicists, the innovators would founder in disorder and madness.
These remarks apply more particularly to poetry, which is verv clearly marked by a traditional group and an anarchist group. The other day there appeared a verv well-compiled anthology entitled the Pleiade. It was selected bv one of our best poets, Joachim Gasquet, author of the Chants Secuiaires and the Hymnes, who died quite recentlv, in May, 1921. It include§ Joachim Ga-cauet himself, the Comtesse de Noailles, gXwier de Magallox. Charles Deren-nes, Pierre Canco, Femand ?Iazade, and Pauil Val6rv.
With the exception of the last. named, these poets seek to give a cla-sic form to emotions which, whatever they may sav. are almost all Romantic in inspiration. In every case one finds happy images, a very special sense of music and ly,rical sincerity, coupled with much emphasis. often exaggerated. To these names must be added those of Abel Bonnard, Jean Louis Vaudover, Paul Souchon, Emile Henriot, Lucien Fabre, Robert Vallery-Radr,t, Andr6 Th6rive, Eus6be de Br6monen d'Ars, Albert Erlande, Fernand Gregh, Maurice Levaillant, and manv others. If they have one feature in cominon-and ihey have, beeause thev belong to the same!generation-it is that their romantic imagination is tempered bv discretion and a taste which the poets of- 1830 liever knew; they also show traces of an old love of the symbolic poets-a certain feeling for the inner life, for the tliings of the soul, for the inborn analogies which ex5st between the outer world and ourselves. On the other hand, they have completely forgotten that there has been a French Parnassus, neither picturesque nor rich of rhyme, nor glittering, but even, -often enough, showing a Idnd of poverty in poetic craftsmanship and technical resources-
SYMBouLsrs As-i UNANUMISTS.
If we now 'turn to an entirely opposite school, we find a complete reviv-al of symbolism--at least, such as was manifested by it-s originators, Uallarmn6 and ArthuLr Rimbaud. Rimbaud especiaUy raised up a whole group after his likeness, which sought like himn to create a world entirely of the brain, without common me-asure witlh our own, a world strange, absolute, and impenetrable. To the influence of Rimbaud came to be added that of MNarinetti and of Guillaume Apollinaire and of the psycho-analysis of Vienna and Zuirich, lwhence spring those pieces withoaut logical coherence, composed of single words, of sl- and half imperceptible analogies, of unexpected tr'cks, mingled w^ith true and just impressions,- with delightfuil banter, the -whole snatched, as it were, with great difficulty from the subconscious life of the brain.
The names of Mlanx Jacob, Andr6 Salmon, Blaise Cendrars, Louis Aragon, Andre Breton, Philippe Soupault, Pierre Reverdy. Jacques Rigauit. Pali Morand, are inseparably associated with these attempts-names to which must be added those of Jean Cocteau, George Gabory, and Radiguet, who, starting from the same source, seem now to wish to return to it through the style of the quatrains of Mallarln6 to I know not what delicate and nalve art of images d'Epinal in literature.
FinaUv we must not forget either the lUnanmi.sts,whoFe rude and inembroidered poetry seeks to interpret the social and general movements of humanity, Jules Romnains, Diuhamel, Luc DIirtaini. Jomve, Arcos, Vildrac, or that little band of fantastic poets who, inspired- by Jotulet who died in 1920, mingle with their light imagination -the irony, the grace, t.he unexpecte.d, of the old poets of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Francis Carco, Jean Pellerin, Ren6 Bizet, Tristan Dereme,- Philippe Chabaneix. AU these poets have published collections since the arnistice and may therefore be judged bv their work.
But I must linger a moment over the most importarnt - of them. Les Forces Etcrnelles, by the Comtesse de Noailles. It is a vXehement and grandiose work, containing two elements 'which are generally irreconcilable andi which are here united by the genius of the poet- on the one hand, a natural lyricism, easy, abundant, admirable ill eloqluence, though an eloquence sometimes too obvious
ann too rhetorical i on the other , a painful s eeeking after human and poetic trutth, lines admnirable and Profound, which sink into the very dePths of the fsoul, One of the highest and purest of
the lyric flounts which have fed humanith . This enormouis book swings between these
two poles--sometimes it is influenced by that kindl of laaw of enumeration
which makes so many? poe ms end with a imaeime adding-up of theme,s s sometimes it nchie s;es those pieces, poignant, sincere, restrained and sober in e xpression, which to) s sa nothing of their picturesque
exterior, result in the finest lyric analyses whiwh it is possible to conceive. Perhaps in this book Mine. do IN'oaailles's music is less rich, less sippless le, haisonioous than in ththe earlier works, but on the other hand, the intellectual and sentiffemntal expression is more intense and true.
31-M. Paul Valry, too, is unrivalle d. It is no doubt realized : ttat this great pbc p belongs to t hhe - gneration of -the
<NEWPAGE>
post-symbolists, to that of the writers who, like Pierre Loilys, Andr6 Gide and Camille Mauclair, came immediately after the Regniers, the Barres, the Paul Adams, the Vi6l6-Griffins. At the age of 25, Paul Valery was celebrated in a
roup of young nmen; then for a long time he kept silence. But, in 1917 he published a new poem, La Jeune Parque, which had considerable success. To-day, Paul Valery holds a privileged place; the reviews struggle for his poems, of which a slim collection appeared recently. It is certain that if Paul Val6ry -is adniired to. this extent, he is in some sort recasting, French poetry. Two essential things distinguish him from other poets-first, the very matter of his verse, which seeks to borrow from the voice itself its ductility, its inflexions, its sweet. variety; then the moral element of which. his verse is nmade, which is in no way accidental or human (in the sense in which a piece of news is human), but intellectual, .abstract and full of allusions to those continuous phenomena which formn the very life of thought. These are the two great original qualities of Paul Val6ry; if space permitted, I would gladly have set them forth more fully.
Turning now to romnance, we find genres less marked than in poetry. Let us pass by for the moment the great writers, who have published since 1919 works as fine as those which came before that date, and to whom we shall refer later. There remain among the young writersthat is to say, the novelists of from 25 to 40-two very definite movements. The one is composed of analysts, writers on the inner life, some of whom study feelings, others ideas and irnages; it must be said that, from this point of view, the present generation will leave clear traces upon the intellectual history of our time. The other consists of writers of adventure, visibly influenced by the great English writers from Daniel Defoe to Stevenson. The whole of the intellectual youth of France belongs to one or the other, and sometimes seeks to unite the two currents.
The analytic novel, in its new form, is chiefly represented by the names of Marcel Proust, Jean Giraudoux, Val6ry Larbaud, Jean Schlumberger, Francis de Miomandre, Paul Morand, Gilbert de Voisins, Jean Louis Vaudoyer, Ernile Henriot, Andr6 Th6rive, Pierre de Barneville, myself and others.
Marcel Proust is clearly one of the most eminent men of the time; he has had the courage to make an entirely fresh study of the human being and not to admit that it possesses any moral movement which is not, in his view, verified by experience-whence his bold* ness and the importanee of what he has
to tell us. It may be said henceforth that there was a psychology before Proust and that there will be one after him.
The case of Jean Giraudoux is very different. He is in the first place a fantasist, but a fantasist who rests upon truth. Imagine an analyst who. does not wish to analyse or demonstrate anything at all, but who makes us perceive all that passes in the soul of his heroes by a play of images, sometimes witty, sometimes lyrical, sometimes ironical. He has points of contact at the same time wvith La Fontaine, with Heine, and with Meredith.
Less recent than the foregoing, Val6ry Larbaud has an extraordinarily just feeling for truth, and with an art acid, sharp, troubled, and a delicate and singular intelligence, he handles moral problems which until his time remained almost impenetrable. The life of the adolescent, of quite young girls, acquires under his pen peculiar freshness and intensity. It may be added that the scene of Valery Larbaud's last novel, Beaute, men beau Souci . . . is London, of which it contains admirable pictures, especially of Chelsea. I have more particularly mentioned three men who seem to me the best, but I refer you equally to all those whose names I have given. I think that this group of writers is going to add something to the tradition of our psychological novel.
TAT s or ADvEX,RuEx.
It has been wTrongly thought by the critics that the popularity of the book of adventure is to be ascribed in France to the war. I do not say that the war has n6t contributed to it, but it must not be forgotten that in 1912 the Nouvelle Revue Fnaneaise published an important essay by M. Jacques Riviere on what, in his view, a French book of adventure ought to be, and that shortly afterwards Alain-Fournier wrote his Grand-1M16aulnes, which may be regarded as a masterpiece of its kind, and Andr6 Gide his Caves du V'atican.
It may be said, besides, that the book of adventure, hardly arrived on the scene, is already inx course of profound modification-or of miscarriage; in this case adventure turns quicldy into melodrama. Nevertheless, several good authors have already distinguished theniselves in this line. We may mentioa Pierre Benoit, wvith Kanigsia,rck and L'Atlantide; Louis Chadourne,- with Le Maitre du ANavire ; Pierre 3Iac-Orlan, with Le Chant de l'Uquipage and A bord de l'Etoile Matutine; Maurice Larrouy, with Rafail Gatouna; Francis Carco, with L'Equipe; Reae Bizet, with L'Aventure aux Guitares; and others. But which of these writers, except perhaps Benoit and Mac-Orlan, will still be writing books of adventure in ten years' time ? On the other hand, I am quite sure that at the same date neither Marcel Proust nxor Giraudoux, Larbaud nor Miomandre, will have modified his usual manner!
We have also, further, among the young writers, story-tellers, who continue more directly the tradition of their immediate -forbears and niAny of whom possess the greatest talent; such are the powerful realists, more or less tinged with philosophy or idealism, Gaston Ch6rau, J6rome and Jean Tharaudc, Emile Baumann, Henri Duvernois, Marcel Boulenger, Binet-Valmer, Pierre Ville-
tard, and others. It may be added that Louis Hemon, who died recently and who belonged to this group, left a fine study of French Canada in Maria Chappe de Laine.
NEW WORKS BY OLD MASTEBS.
Finally, we must not forget that our well-known novelists have published since the armistice works which count among their best-as if the end of the war had given them all a fresh impulse of energy and power. Thus Prime Jeunesse is one of the finest novels of Pierre Loti, and Le Petit Pierre one of the most perfect works of Anatole France. Paul Bourget has written a magnificent novel in Un Drame dans le 1Monde, and in Le J'usticier and Anomalies books which will remain masterpieces of this kind so characteristically French.
Henri de R6gnier has taken us back in La Pecheresse to the seventeenth century which he knows so well. In Tant pis pour o Gerard'd'Houville gives himself up to the deliciousi fancies of a keen and always poetic imagination. Among others, Abef Hermant has written La Journee brave, a dramatic and poignant picture of the years before the war; Andr6 Gide has given us his admirable Symphonie Pastorale; Louis Bertrand an historic picture in L'Infante; J. H. Rosny art extraordtinary prehistoric tale inx Le~ Fain Giant'; Henri Lavedan a sort of popular epic poem, 1rNne Oldie and
Gaudias; Reae Boylesve a moving portrait of a woman, Elise; Marcel Pr6vost a dramatic story, La nuit finira; and Henri Bordeaux his two studies on the moral consequences of the war, La Reurrection de la Chair and La Chair et l'Esprit.
One may see from this rapid examination the imnportance and vitelity of French literature since the war. We have endeavoured to distinguish from the current flood of production the great laws which direct it and the. currents which are -to be felt in it. Those which we have set forth are certain, but are they last-
g ? Literary fashions change ever more qtuckly. will the movements which wo have indicated survive longer than their predecessors.? The future alone can tell.
TRANSLATIONS IN FRANCE.
The chiefnovels of Thoma3 Hardy have been known in France for 20 yeurs--t all events, Jude the Obacure and Tees of the D'Urberrilles. Other works of Hardy's, less important, have appeared in translation; one only is missing, The Mayor of Casterbridge, which will be published in October among the collection of the Nouvelle Revue Fran$aise. The Nouvelle Revue Franiaise has also undertaken a complete translation of George Meredith-no light task! The Shating of Sle gpat has appeared recently, Beaucha mp's Career and T'he Egoiwt will be out this autumn. The same firm has also undertaken -the translation of the chief works of Henry James, of which the first volume is ready for publication; of Samuel Butler, admirably translated by one of our best young writers, Valery Larbaud; of Joseph Conrad, whose Typhoon has appeared in a perfect translation by Andr6 Gide; and the plays of W. B. Yeats.
Rudyard Kipling was long ago published by the Mercure de France; I believe that the Jungle Book is almost as popular in France as in English-speaking countries. The Sirene, which has already published the plays of Synge, is about to issue John Galsworthy's The Man of Property and James Joyce's Portrait of the Artist in his Youth.
Three publishing houses simultaneously (the Nouvelle Revue Fran.aise, the Edition Francaise Illustr6e, and the Sirene) have issued during the last two years the principal works of R. L. Stevenson, who is extremely popular in France.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS554242372/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=0edffa73

DEFECTS OF THE ROMANTIC SCHOOL.
Professor Grierson delivered yesterday beforethe British Academy the Warton Lecture on English Poetry, and took as his subject “ Byron, Arnold, and Swinburne.”
The Lecturer recalled the controversy which had been excited in the eighties of last century by Matthew Arnold’s claim that Wordsworth and Byron were the greatest English poets of the V.'th century. To this Swinburne had replied with the utmost reverence, speaking with respect of Wordsworth, but emptying upon Byron’s head the frothing vials of his shrill and exuberant vituperation, and championing against both the more purely imaginative and musical poetry of Coleridge and Shelley. This attitude towards Byron was explicable if one recalled the exotic spirit and exquisite technique of tho poetry of the “ sweet new ’• school ot Rossetti and Swinburne, their wonderful reconstructions of old moods and old modes. The style ot I) yr on must be judged on its own merits. His accents were those of the orator and the talker, and for his purposes these were the most effective. Swinburne judged him by standards that were not entirely applicable. He was as generous a fighter in tho cause of humanity as Shelley and more practical and intelligible. For Byron there was no escape from the conflict in his soul by way of any romantic dream of a return to nature. The only escape lay in heroic action and self-control, the summons which took him to die in Greece.
The question raised between Arnold and Swinburne was primarily that between poetry as an art, existing for its own sake, and poetry as a reflection and criticism of life. But it also raised the whole question of the, poetry of the Semantic Period. That poetry had been fed on dreams of nature, of the golden age, of the ages of faith, of progress, to an extent that was not true of the great poetry of other epochs—Greek tragedy, Shakespeare, aud the Elizabethans. These had found in human nature as it was, and was always likely to be. tho material for tragedy and comedy and poetry, or if they wrote of ideals it was as an incentive to the individual in the perennial war of good and evil. We had, lost touch with that side of romantic poetry with Milton’s theology. Poetry must come back to earth, and learn with Thomas Hardy that its great theme was humanity regarded with a sense of pity and a sense of humour. It was because Byron was not a romantic at all, as was said by way of reproval, but a poet as full of humanity as that other misanthrope Swift, that his poetry, despite its limitations, had still a touch of magnetism.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS169283449/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=01af85fa

ACCESSORY MUSIC.
EARLY RECITALS.
Ideas about songs and singing have found an unusually prominent place in the recitals of this week. Mr. Douglas Marshall led the way pn Monday, when, in a programme which he gave at the Æolian Hall, he included a manifesto about the interpretation of poetry through music., This was put forward as the theory on which Mr. Alec Robertson had composed a set of five songs, which were given a central place in the programme.
Mr. Douglas Marshall sang the songs ; he also wrote the manifesto, and arranged that Mme. Adey Brunel should recite each poem before the song was sung. The song, the interpretation, and the theory were trli submitted to the judgment of the audience with a frankness which deserves the response of sympathetic attention. The theory, lilte most theories of art, seemed to us a half-truth. It laid stress on an idea which has been recurring to literary-minded musicians constantly for the last 300 years at least—namely, that the art of adding rnusfe to poetry still requires some justification, which is found in the plea that the music interprets the poetry. But it is when we come to consider how music interprets poetry, or anything else for that matter, that the difficulties begin. If we understood this theory aright, and Mr. Alec Robertson’s practical exposition of it in the songS before us, the answer was that it is to be done by making music conform, as far as possible, to all the dimensions of poetry. Mr. Marshall says, “A changed accent, an over-prolonged syllable to give time for a musical effect, or a volumetric error for the sake of vocal effect, are all unjustifiable.” That answer has been .responsible for most of the wrong tracks which' song writing has taken, because it ignores the fact that music can only be anything when it follows its own laws and fulfils its own dimensions. “ Just note and accent ” are valuable accessories of interpretation, but the great song is the one which throws a wholly riew light on the poem by refashioning it in a musical- design: The more the poetry insists on its own design the less it is likely to provide a suitable opportunity for music. Hence it comes ' that' the majority ot the greatest songs of the world have been made with inferior poetry.
Mr. Alec Robertson and Mr. Marshall, too, are very conscientious in ""following every verbal suggestion, and the former ha's been particularly successful in the conversation betwee.1 a nymph and a goblin, called “ Overheard on a Salt Marsh.” Comparing the sung version of the poem with Mmex Brunei’s spoken one, one realized that the two were doing just the same thing through the two mediums of the singing voice and the splitting voice, but one questioned whether the interpretation of the singing voice deserved to be called "" soxig"" more than that of the speaking voice. Every honest singer knows that the song is more than words plus notes, and Mr. Marshall proved his knowledge of it in singing “Bocca ridenti” with evident dqlight in its purely musical qualities. His tone and wo cal control seem to have improved lately. He found so much to express through them that he denied his own theory in “Land of Heart’s Desire.” one of a selection from "" Songs of the Hebrides.’* Indeed, it was so loaded with long-dqiwn vocal effect that one was tempted-to search for "" volumetric errors” instead of listening to a simple folksong. It should be mentioned that Mr. Aubyn Raymarfy perfect accompaniment added much to the success of this recital.
Music by Chart.
Miss Ursula Greville’s attempt to combine song with ideas on ths following ; night was less stimulating, because she reduced the song to & minimum, and left the ideas to someone else. Mr. Leigh Henry was her spokesman, and, armed with an elaborate chart of song composers, which reminded one drearily of a plan for telephonic communication in trench warfare, he proceeded to a disquisition on the history of song from primitive chant to Stravinsky. After -20 minutes ot thia sort of thing, to give one verse each'of such songs as "" Sally in our alley ” and “ It was a lover arid bis lass,” to proceed then to further disquisition is""-to make rather large demands on the patience of an ’Audience which has come to hear music. Mr. Leigh Henry’s warning against treating music as a literary accessory deserves to he borne in mind in considering the MarshallRobertson theory. In this instance, ’however, music became an accessory to Mr. Leigh Henry, which is worse, and Miss Ursula Greville’s pretty voice and finished style deserved better.
The plan of Mr. Gerald Cooper’s programme at the Mortimer Hall on Wednesday showed him also to be a
singer with ideas. Bach, Mozart, and the Elizabethan song-books foiled- .the first part x>t the - scheme; five poems by W. B. Yeats, set by Philip Heseltine for voice, flute, English horn, -and string quartet, and Bernard van Dieren^ "" Schon Rohtraut,” for voice and string quartet,represented ^the moderns. With a new Rhapsody for mezzo-soprano (Miss Dorothy Helmrich) and instruments, by Arthur Bliss, and a Mozart quartet for flute and strings (Koechel, 285), this promised an evening full of interesting variety, but the singing did not fulfil the promise. One feels certain that Mr, Cooper, with his evident taste and perception, could do more to get over the disabilities of a small voice. At present his whole manner is too cramped and restrained to convey anv definite idea of what the music means to him.
On the same evening Miss Ilma Marx gave a recital at the Æolian Hall. Her programme was planned on thoroughly conventional- lines, and placing it beside the experiments we have here described, one realizes that such a programme has its advantages. The singer can concentrate on her performance. Her singing of "" Deh vieni "" was well polished and musical, it a little inelastic in rhythm. Her voice was not commanding enough to give thorough satisfaction in "" Ritorna vincitor"" (Aioa), but it was a capable performance. . . .
There were some elements of good singing in Miss Iseult Morice's recital at the Wigmore Hall on Wednesday, if we may make the assumption that she felt very nervous ; for the voice trembled so much that it was sometimes hard to tell what the note was, and it seemed impossible for her to hold any note through to the end unchanged. The words were pronounced unaffectedly, just as we speak them, but not quite clearly enough to enable us to put down the programme and listen. • The phrasing was particularly sane and intelligible, and the idea of the song as a whole was made clear.
“ RectTal Concerts.”
Mr. Sterling Mackinlay did not convince us, by the first of a series of "" recital concerts,” as he calls them, winch took place at the Wigmore Hall on Monday night, that he is going to add greatly to the musical amenities of the town. He has not set himself a sufficiently high standard of performance, while the selection of music to be performed does not indicate a character clearly enough defined. Is

Mme. Sylvienne d Albert, who was malmig a. first appearance, was handicapped by the difficulties of “ Connais-tu le pays ’ from Mignon, and her con----- . 1 assured manner only made her vocal deficiencies stand out the more. She has a soprano voice of excellent quality, but her method is poor
and her singing generally hard and uneven. Miss Dorothie Squire, a mezzo-soprano—-another naturally
voiinais-i fldent and
good voice—also showed lack of thoroughness in training, for she was. inclined to force the tone and get out of tune, while the actual production was “ woqjly.” Mr. Vincent Ryan has a resonant baritone voice and a rough-and-ready style of delivery which made his performance of the Prologue to Paaliaeci heavy and unconvincing.
The New Russian Ckoib, under Mr. Saminsky. heard at the Wigmore Hall on Tuesday, would probably have sounded better without the piano ; but one cannot be sure, since both sopranos and tenors force their notes out ot tune, and what at least held together might have fallen apart. They sang songs of moderate difficulty with accurate time, but without much unanimity of phrasing ; one called “ The Noisy Rain "" had rather more character than others^ We were glad to hear Miss Lilias Macldnnon and Mme. Zoia Rosowsky again, about whose playing and singing there is no question.
Mr. Laukasce Turner, accompanied by Mr. O'Connor Morris, played at the Wigmore' Hall on Thursday last week Lalo’s Symphonic Espagnole, the Chaconne, and some smaller pieces. He has, at his best, a remarkably good intonation, though there were some equally remarkable lapses. The Chaconne was taken too fast ; it is long, it is true, and even a good player, such as he is, may be forgiven for fearing that his audience may get impatient. But the “ length "" of music has nothing to do with the clock. Brahms’s Hungarian Dance No. 7 showed a sense of rhythm, but a Rondo of Mozart’s was again too fast The best music we heard, as performance merely, was Cyril Scott's Sonnet No. 2.
Mr. Godfrey Ludlow, who played the next night at the same place with the same accompanist is not very firm in his intonation and has a limited technique, but there Is a good deal of music in his bow. Leken's- Sonata in E major has need of it; there are long melodic passages that ask for all that a player can put into them, and on the whole received it Moffat's "" Le Paon ” is certainly a find, and would make -many a modest fiddler happy who could extract the music from its grave meanderings ; the same can hardly be said of an Adagio "" bizarria "" by (we are not told Much) Bach.

Winbolt has compiled the “ Christ’8 Hospital Anthology ” of “ The Poetry and Prose of Coleridge, Lamb, and Leigh Hunt ” (Bryce, 12s. 6d.n.), as an act of piety after “ a school fife of 11 years at Christ’s Hospital, four years of close connexion with the school as an exhibitioner at Oxford, and 28 years as a master both in London and at Horsham.” By putting together these extracts and prefacing them with an account of the lives of the writers woven into a single story, he hopes both to remedy the neglect of these illustrious Bluecoats which he has observed among Christ’s Hospital boys, and to show the general public how closely the lives of the three were “ interdependent and coloured by early school associations."" He would have been more likely, we think, to stir young imaginations and fix in his readers’ minds “ the general literary and political tendencies of the time ” if he had chosen a less arid system of chronicling. Indeed, such sentences as “ Next year (1809)—that of Corunna, Wagram, Talavera, and Wellington’s retreat to Torres Vedras, and of the birth of Tennyson—was not to improve much the position of Coleridge,” or “ While Peel was carrying Catholic Emancipation in Ireland to a triumphant issue, Lamb, living with the Westwoods at Enfield Chase, was returning more particularly to poetry as a solace,” are not arid merely, but bewildering. They make a fine art of irrelevance.
Coleridge, Lamb, and Leigh Hunt were not strictly school contemporaries. The first two came to Christ’s Hospital in 1782 ; the third did not enter there till ten years later. It is said that
in the charming bronze group shown here, which is one of the school prizes, the third head bent over the book with Lamb’s and Coleridge’s is not Leigh Hunt’s, but belongs to T. F. Middleton., a creature of quite another mould. “ M. is said to bear his mitre high in India,” Lamb noted when his schoolfellow became
Bishop of Calcutta. Middleton is to be seen to-day in St. Paul's in all the pomp of marble wig and lawn. He stands blessing two nude and tiny Indians, male and female, and by the unlearned is frequently mistaken for the Almighty creating Adam and Eve. Decidedly Middleton is no fourth for our triumvirate.
“It is probably difficult for anyone but an old Christ’s Hospital boy,” says Mr. Winbolt, “ to realize the very great extent to which these three men bore the strong stamp of Christ’s Hospital all their lives.” It would be less difficult if he had not himself hidden the
key by omitting from his anthology Lamb’s “ Recollections of Christ’s Hospital. Coming as a rule from a family “ liberal though reduced,” says Lamb, the Blue of that day had a character of his own, a blend of “ pride ” and “ restraining modesty,” which was “ as far removed from the abject qualities of a common charity boy as it is from the disgusting forwardness of a lad brought up at some other of the public schools.” He was a gentleman, and, therefore, clearly marked off from the “ charitable grinders ” and other uniformed schoolboys with whom he brushed shoulders in the City streets; but he was a poor gentleman, and therefore could not ape the strut of the sons of the ruling class. What differentiates the legends of the Christ’s Hospitallers from those of other great schools is a certain graceful lucklessness in their heroes, a kind of whimsical gallantry in misfortune. Are these notes not easily to be marked in the after-lives of Coleridge and Elia and Leigh
Hunt I
A NURSE OF ROMANTICISM.
Let us take an illustration or two. Leigh Hunt tells us in his “ Autobiography ” that the ogre Boyer once knocked out one of his teeth with the back of a Homer. The sight of the blood alarmed the pedagogue, but, adds "" Skimpole,” charmingly, “ it was a loose tooth, and I told him so.” “ I did not know it was forewarned, sir,” pleads the hero of another legend, caught in an outrage on the master’s desk too gross to have been provided against by the lawgiver, and even Boyer is vanquished. Vanquished, too, was the town-damsel whom Elia’s friend Allen pinched in waggishness, and who, “turning tigress-like round, was converted by his “ angel look ” and changed her terrible halfformed word to “ Bless thy handsome face ! ” Did Allen, we wonder, look at all like the shyly deprecating “ Grecian ” who appears in a reproduction of an old print here, wearing (rare sight I) the “ little cap no bigger than a crumpet ” on the side of his head ? If so, we understand why the town-damsel melted. To bathe in forbidden waters is commonplace, but to be lectured from the bank, as Leigh Hunt and his fellows were, by her Serene Highness the Margravine of Anspach, majestic in hat and feathers and trailing riding-skirt, could only befall boys who should have been wearing blue coats. No royal favours for them, you perceive, but at least no common hangman’s rope. They are spoiled by no genie but the spirit of Romance.
To return to the “ Recollections."" They contain a passage more significant than any we have yet quoted.
The Christ’s Hospital boy is a religious character. His school is eminently a religious foundation ; it has its peculiar prayers, its services at set times, its graces, hymns, and anthems, following each other in an almost monastic closeness of succession.. This religious character in him is not always untouched by superstition. . . . Hence the peculiar avidity with which such books as the Arabian Nights Entertainments, and others of a still wilder cast, are, or at least were in my time, sought for by the boys.
Religion, superstition, • and the Arabian Nights ! Here are the Ancient Mariner, and Kubla Khan, and Abou Ben Adhem, and the essay on “ Witches and Other Night Fears.” Here, too, the metaphysical dreams and ecclesiastical musings of Coleridge’s declining age. In the revolt of early manhood he may sketch his “ Pantisocrasy ""—a Utopia in the style of Rousseau for “ twelve gentlemen of good education and liberal principles” and twelve ladies to match—but he will end as the compeer of Chateaubriand and the Schlegels. He will indoctrinate England with transcendental Idealism, and carelessly sow the seeds of the Church revival. He will pass away not dreaming of what he has done, and Arnold and Newman will battle for his relics.

THE DYNASTS” AND SHAKESPEARE.
POETRY AND SUGGESTION.
The other day, at the corner of a Bloomsbury square, I found my path blocked by a little crowd of children who were watching a puppet show of an unusual kind. The usual kind, of course, is Punch and Judy, which has become a degenerate thing, with its puppets grasped in the operator’s hand; these puppets were wired, in the grand manner of the art, and had a horse and cart, no less, for their transport. The show, though lamentably poor in itself -—the puppets merely danced solemnly round and round without any attempt at dramatic action—was rich in suggestion. Do we not all keep a warm corner of our hearts for the puppets, if only for their venerable antiquity and their choice literary associations ? Why, in the grave pages of tho Literary Supplement learned archæologists have lately been corresponding . about the Elizabethan “ motions,” and in the very last number Sir William Ridgeway traced tho puppets back to the Syracuse of Xenophon’s day and told us how that author in his “ Symposium ” makes a famous Syracusan puppet player say that he esteems fools above other men because they are those who go to seo his puppets (vtvp-arraara). My own recollections connect Xenophon with parasangs rather than puppets, but I am glad to be made aware of this honourable pedigree, though I strongly resent the Syracusan’s remark about the amateurs of puppets. I share the taste of Partridge, who ” loved a puppetshow of all tho pastimes upon earth,” and I sympathize with the showman in “ Torn Jones ” who could tolerate all religions save that of the Presbyterians, “because they were enemies to puppet-shows.” And sol lingered with the children at the corner of the Bloomsbury square.
Puppets, some one has said, have tliis advantage over actors : they are made for what they do, their nature conforms exactly to their destiny. I have seen them hi Italy performing romantic drama with a dash and a panache that no English actor hi my recollection (save, perhaps, the late Mr. Lewis Waller) could rival. Actors, being men as well as actors, and therefore condemned to eSort in acting, if only tho eSort of keeping down their consciousness of their real, total self, cannot attain to this clear-cut definiteness and purity of performance. But the wire-puller must be a true artist, his finger-tips responsive to every emotional thrill of the character and every1 nuance of the drama ; indeed, the ideal wirepuller is the poet himself, expressing himself through the motions of his puppets and declaiming his own words for them.
It was with this thought in my mind that I ventured, when Mr. Hardy first published The Dynasts, to suggest that the perfect performance of that work would be as a puppetshow, with Mr. Hardy reading out his own
blank verse. I pointed out the suggestive reference to puppets in the text. One of the Spirits describes the human protagonists as “ mere marionettes,” and elsewhere you read:— Forgetting the Prime Mover of the gear As puppet-watchers him who moves the strings.
Further, at the very core of Mr. Hardy’s drama is the idea that these Napoleons and Pitts and Nelsons are puppets of the Immanent Will. If ever there was a case for raising a puppet-show to the highest literary dignity, tliis was one. •
But it was all in vain. Either Mr. Hardy
was too modest to declaim liis own verse in public, or else the actors pushed in, as they will-wherever they can, and laid hands on as much of his work as they could manage. And so wo had Mr. Granville Barker's version early in the war and only the other day the performance ut Oxford and I have nothing to say against either, save that they were, and could only be, extracts', episodes, fragments, instead of the great epic-drama in its panoramic entirety. A puppet-show could embrace the whole, and one voice declaiming tho poem would to be sure not give the necessary unity of impression— that singleness must bo first of all in the work itself—but would incidentally emphasize it.
The puppet presentation would, however, do much more than tins, It would clarify, simplify, attenuate the medium through which tho poem reaches tho audience. The poet and his public would be in close contact. It is,' of course, for many minds, especially for those peculiarly susceptible to poetry, a perpetual grievance against the actors that these living, bustling, solid people get between them and the poet and substitute fact, realism, flesh-and-blood for what these minds prefer to embody only in their imagination. There is the notorious instance of Charles Lamb, with his objection to seeing Shakespeare’s tragedies acted. He complained that the gay and witty Richard HL was inevitably materialized and vulgarized by the actor. Lamb, as we all know, was capricious, and indeed made a virtue of caprice, but what do you say to so serious and weighty a critic as Professor Raleigh ? Talking about the Shakespearian boy-actors of women, he commits himself to this:—“ It may lie doubted whether Shakespeare has not suffered more than he has gained by the genius of later-day actresses, who bring into the plays a realism and a robust emotion which sometimes obscure the sheer poetic value of the author’s conception. The boys were no doubt very highly trained, and amenable to instruction; so that the parts of Rosalind and Desdemona may well have been rendered with a clarity and simplicity .which served as a transparent medium for the author’s wit and pathos. Poetry, like religion, is outraged when it is made a platform for the exhibition of their own talent and passions by those who are its ministers. With the disappearance of the boy-players tho poetic drama died in England, and it has had no second life.""
A little "" steep,” is it not ? Logically it is an objection to all acting of poetic drama. Boy-players of girls are only a half-way house. The transparent medium, for tho author’s wit and pathos would bo still more transparent if it were merely the medium of the printed page. . Now this much is certain. Shakespeare conceived his plays, whatever poetry or wit or pathos he put into them, in terms of men and women (not boy-women). Tho ideal performance of Sliakespeare would be by tho men and women who grew in Shakespeare’s imagination. But they, unfortunately, do not exist in flesh and blood, but only in that imagination, and, to bring them on. the stage, you have to employ ready-made men and women, who at tho very best can only be rough approximations to the imaginary figures. In this sense it is not a paradox but a simple commonplace to say that no one has ever seen Shakespeare’s Hamlet on tho stage, or ever will see. And.the greater the “ genius ” of the actor, the more potent his jjersonality—though he will be tho darling of the majority, thirsting for realism, the immediate sense of life—the more will he get between the poet and imaginative students like Lamb and Professor Raleigh, who want their poetry inviolate.
Tliis seems like a digression, but is really to my purpose. Flesh-and-blood actors we shall always have with'us; they will take good care of that themselves. But for the imaginative souls who are for compromise, who are for halfway houses and look back fondly to the boyplayers, I would say: Why not try the Œts ? These also present a “ transparent m ” for the author’s expression. And, further, tho purely “ lyrical"" passages in which Shakespeare abounds and wliich seem so odd in-the realism of the human actors (e.g., the Queen’s description of Ophelia’s death) would gain immensely by being recited by the poet (or wire-puller). A puppet-show Hamlet nught be an exquisite experiment in that highest art
whose secret is suggestion.

AN ARTISTS TWO PHASES.
The exhibition of paintings by Mr. Duncan Grant at the Gallery of Messrs. Paterson and Carfax, 5, Old Bond-street, leaves us puzzled and a little depressed by a wilfulness, perhaps unconscious, which seems to hamper his great talent. No cne can look at his Room with a View without seeing that he is a born painter, one whose very paint makes beauty, when ho chooses. It is the same with the flower piece next to it. These are bosh what we may call lyrical pictures, beauty conjured out of the paint, as the lyric poet conjures it out of words; colour unforced and almost undesigned. Everything is unexpected but right; and it all seems to be effortless. ■ Perhaps it is; perhaps the weakness of Mr. Grant is to mistrust himself when he is not effortless. Anyhow, this spontaneous beauty turns in other pictures into a kind of automatism. Take, for instance^ the nude, Venus and Adonis. Here the head of Venus is charmingly conceived and executed against the cloudy background, but in the body Mr. Grant gives us a series of billowy curves, each of which seems t o involve the other with a mechanical rather than inspired inevitability. The body is a mere pretext for these curves, as if a poet had started a poem with a few lines of sense and' then had let the words run off with him into ahey-diddle-diddle jifigle,
. This jingle-painting really gives up the problem of art, the problem of maintaining a counterpoint between words and sense or design and reality. Here and in another nude the counterpoint is gone, and we have a design of mere echoes, like rhyme for rhyme’s sake in verse. And so it is with the still life, the Wash-hand stand, where are the same billowing curves imposed on the objects rather than drawn out of them. It will be said that Mr. Grant gives us a pure design; but, just as the most beautiful music is always found in words that express sense unforced, so, it seems to us, Mr. Grant’s best designs come where he draws them out of nature, as in the two pictures we mentioned first, and the fine portrait of a Lady, and several delicate landscapes. It may be that the hey-diddle-diddle kind of picture is a useful exercise as a first sketch for a work in which the billowing should be mitigated and the echoes softened until they seemed but a natural emphasis. As it is, Mr. Grant seems to have a real, and an automatic or mechanical, spontaneity without any intermediate phase. We should, like to see him deliver himself up utterly for a while to the passion for nature ; we believe his devotion would be rewarded.
Major Darsie Japp, in a number of small pictures in the Twenty-One Gallery, Durham House-street, Adelphi, shows himself an interesting landscape painter as we might expect from his large picture in the War Pictures exhibition, where he has solved the difficulty
of combining large figures with landscape very cleverly. He has great variety of. method ; indeed he seems to see landscape eimply and as a whole and then to paint it as directly'as. possible. Thus his colour is unforced and convincing in pictures such as the Undercliff and the Hedge at Tremedda. In the portrait called Aragonese he practises the fashionable emphasis by slight distortion; but he is more successful with his Breton Boy, which looks like a direct transcript from life, with an emphasis firm but nowhere forced. It is an admirable little painting. •",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS169152074/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=135753c1

COMMONPLACE.
.MR. JOHN BAILEY’S WARTON LECTURE.
; i
Mr. John Bailey, at the invitation of the Council of the British Academy, delivered this year’s “ Warton Lecture on English Poetry ” at a meeting of the Academy held yesterday at the rooms of the Royal Society. He took as his subject “ Poetry and Commonplace.” Dr. J. W. Mackail presided.
Poetry, said. Mr. Bailey, might at first sight seem to have no relation to commonplace. But the word commonplace meant a truth of general application: and, if most often used now of truths which were merely trite, it also included those great truths of universal application which were of inexhaustible life. Of these poetry could not have too much. It had no greater business than to be for ever rediscovering their meaning, till in its hands platitudes came to life again as aphorisms. The great poets were at least as much occupied in giving new life to old things as in discovering new. How little many of them, Virgil, Dante, Shakespeare, Moliere, cared about inventing new matter for their poetry I Men more commonly required to be reminded, as Johnson said, than to be informed. We were vaguely aware that death was certain or spring delightful: but when Shakespeare retold these things dull knowledge took on a throbbing energy of sudden life.
No poet illustrated this better than Wordsworth, who took common life, plain people, and universal emotions and gave them freshness and. power. What was it which to-day had most meaning for us in Hebrew poetry ? the eternal freshness of such ancient commonplaces as God is our hope and strength. What did we love most in Horace ? Again the beauty with which he had recreated the hoariest commonplaces of life and morals. The same thing might be illustrated from Homer, Pindar, and the Greek tragedians. And the other side of its truth was seen in contemporary poetry which, with all its energy and interestingness, was apt to lack universality and timelessness. So again it might be seen in George Meredith, who did what he could to kill his poetry by the restless ingenuity of his intellect-, which seemed to scorn to share the common thoughts of men. Contrast Gray, who, by the opposite method, had given us the best loved and most quoted poem, in the language. These instances, the Psalms, Horace, Gray, all illustrated the truth that, even if originality be the greatest of the gifts of genius, it could not do its work if it neglected to lay its vivifying hand on the common things of life, the universal thoughts and feelings of men.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS286854523/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=cdfaaf63

MR. YEATS AS A PROPHET. .
(KROM A correspondent.)
, ... ,, ,
Modern Irish literature—using the term, to
designate all that body of modem writing in the English, language by men. whose Irish nationality is generally recognized - shows up ” better in prose than in poetry. This is a curious thing; for in. Gaelic literature tne poet has played a prominent part, as he has done too among modern patriotic writers of English,
front the school of Thomas Davis to that of Mr.
Yeats. The explanation is that, if we accept the above very general and wide definition of Irish literature, we take into account some of
the great masters of English prose—Burke, Sheridan, Swift, Berkeley, Goldsmith, and1 Wilde.' It would be impossible assuredly to compile from among Irish poets using the English tongue a list of equal weight. If, as the cynics say, Ireland is the best country in the world for men of talent to live out of, then
; we will conclude, pitting a Burke and a Sheridan against a Moore and a Mangan, that the modern
Irish talent is a prose talent; and our histories of Irish literature will be largely concerned with those free and adventurous spirits of whom Mr. Bernard Shaw boasts himself the
supreme type, that great tribe of “ denational¬
ized ” Irishmen,1 brilliant journalists, men of
letters, orators, who busy themselves mainly(though with a detachment rare among native Englishmen) with England and English interests, But there is no- example"" that we- can "" recall of
a denationalized Irish poet; our poets— seek the reason as you will—have been curiously stay-at-home, have never lost their preoccupation with nationality;’ and in recent times, as a sort of -compensation- for the less of our men of prose, we have had bo#complete ah Englishman • as Lionel Johnson, the"" son of Oxford and Winchester, applying for » certificate of. Irish naturalization that he might assist in the foundation of a school of Dublin literature. (Two such unquestionably “ Irish poets” as Thomas Davis and P. H. Pearse were, one may add in parenthesis, the sons of Welshmen.)
Thought or Country.
Thought of country has been the leading inspiration of almost all modern Irish poetry.. Even Mr. Yeats, for all his protest against propaganda in verse, for all bis literary and philosophical theories, proclaims his kinship with the men from whose verses so much of Irish popular patriotism has been derived:—
Know that I would accounted be True brother of that company, Who sang to sweeten Ireland’s wrong, Ballad and story, rann and song. Nor may I less be counted one With Davis, Mangan, Ferguson.
In an essay written 12 years ago Yeats told how when a boy he had sought, together with Lionel Johnson and Miss Katharine Tynan, to reform Irish poetry by a criticism of those poets of Young Ireland, principally Thomas Davis, whose “ ardent ideas,” however, and “ high attitude of mind ” should never be forgotten. The new poetry would be as close as the old to “ romantic Ireland”
Mr.
and would take from Sir Samuel Ferguson “ pleasure in the heroic legends ” of Celtic Ireland, from Allingham and others much matter of fairy lore, (which might ■ become a “reasoned belief” in the light of the-new “ philosophy of spiritism ”); but it would march in the movement of English and European literature by reason of a “ more organic form,” a “ more subtie rhythm ” than Davis or Ferguson, had at their command; - If Mr.’ Yeats did think matters out this way as a young man, he was admirably prophetic. Although the combination of heroic legend, fairy lore, spiritism, and the scenery and associations of Ireland is found only in Mr. Yeats’s own work, one or other of these things has provided subject matter for practically every contemporary Irish poet, from “ Æ ” (Mr. George'Russell) to Mr. Austin Clarke, the young writer whose long narrative piece.“The Vengeance of Finn” had so excellent a reception on its appearance a year or two ago. But “Æ ” chose the myths of India as well as those of Ireland for his symbols of. expression, and the early interesting work of Mr. James Stephens, realistic in manner and matter, was, if Irish enough, anything but Celtic in Matthew Arnold’s sense of that term.
: A Keener CRtricAh Faccmy.
Since Mr. Yeats began to preach on the subject, Irish poets. in English have shown careful regard: for technique, and such in-
fluences as it has accepted from the poetry of England and of. the world have-been influences of a superior kind. Thus, many of. those minor poets whom Dublin has in. recent years produced in such numbers have lacked; the spontaneous gift of. verse and the spiritual energy of men like, Thomas Davis, D’Arcy Magee, and other of the patriotic singers of the middle 19th century ; but they have- been possessed of a keener critical faculty, of a better literary education. . Even, the “ poets of the, Rebellion”,,(as they are now called) broke away altogether from their revolutionary.

predecessors in point, of style. The times are gone by ■ when irreproachable- Irish opinions"" and feeling, together with an ability to Imitate the swing of Macaulay, were sufficient equip-1 merit for an Irish poet. Whether or no Plunkett and MacDonagh represented a reaction from; the political point of view,.they were, from.the i point of view of letters, quite modem young
a real footing of equality with the major poets 1C’—'—J v ’
of England. For the rest, in the general revaluation of Anglo-Irish poetry, then undertaken by such thorough scholars and men of taste as Mr. T. VV. Rolleston (himself the author of one of the most memorable of modem poems, "" The De ad at Clonmacnoise ” ), Mr. A. P. Graves and Mr. Stopford .Brooke, Sir Samuel
.
Ferguson had the advantage over Mangan, and Mangan-the advantage over the once allconquering Moore. This - revaluation -has- not
conquering Moore. __ _._
had to be revised, although even * yet Ferguson; the atithor of the epic “ Congal” and of the beauti-
ful “Lament for Thomas Davis?’ has-not as many English readers aS he deserves. During these years, however, -the modem Anglo-Irish school of poets, of which “ Æ” has been the real chief, has receded somewhat ’ in ""public estimation, mainly for the reason that it-has riot done as much work as was expected rif it; To many the most precious things' produced in that school have been “ Æ’s ” three small volumes of mystical poetry; but "" Æ” latterly has devoted himself almost wholly to prose. The same is true of Mr. James Stephens, though we must not forget his fine tribute"" to Ireland of -a year or two -"" ago, •* Green Branches,” Seumas- O’Sullivan, and others of the same group • still publish' charming "" lyrics, but they have not developed in nbw, original directions; Mr. Yeats; oti the"" other hand, though he has Spoken' of himself '■ as discouraged, has never "" yet come to a standstill either as a poet or a theorist. The arrival of Synge caused him to ""enlarge, if not to alter fundamentally, his conception of Irish literature. He had, in. the course of his championship of Synge, many, quarrels with public opinion, and these partly led no doubt to that curious change of tone and atmosphere which has marked much of bis recent verse. His two last volumes, “Responsibilities*’ and “The Wild Swans of Coole,” have been in parts characterized by an asperity and irony very foreign to the temper of Mr. Yeats’s earlier work. This character is"" particularly ""notable in the pieces d’occasion at which Mr. Yeats now sometimes tries his hand-.. In the poem about Parnell, “To a Shade,” which is a protest against Dublin’s treatment of Sir Hugh Lane, that “ To a Wealthy Man,” and others of the .same series, mixed with the asperity and the irony are many memorable, things, haughty expressions- of an artist’s creed, tender lines which celebrate some, bld and heroic Irish
memory,-or""render some vivid impression an Irish scene :t—’
Was it for .this the wild geese spread The grey, wing, upon every tide;
For this that all that blood was shed,.
For this Edward Fitzgerald died, And Robert Emmet and Wolfe Tone All that delirium o£ the brave ?
And again in “To a Shade ” :—
If you have revisited the town, thin Shade, Whether to look upon your ..monument (I wonder if the braider has beep paid), . Or happier thoughted"" when the day is spent
To drink of that salt breath out of the sea
of
When grey gulls , flit about-instead of men, And the gaunt houses put on majesty: . Det these content you. and, be gone again;
’ For they, are at their old tricks yet.
. < Love Poems.
- In the love poems- of- this volume too—and they are some of the finest Mr.; Yeats has written—there is a . similar precision of utterance :— -
.What can they know of love who do not know She builds her nest upon a narrow ledge
- .Above a windy precipice?. .
(“ The Two Kings ”). And the same complaint of the things; of his time in “ No Second Troy” :— '. ”■ ""

In the realm of Anglo-Irish poetry Mr. Yeats’s dominance seems even more clearly established than it was 10 or 15 years ago.

SIR HERBERT WARREN ON THE NOTE OF EMPIRE.
!
At a meeting ot tho Itoyal Colonial Institute, yesterday, Sir Charles Lucas to the chair, Sui IlEliBEirr Wahhbn read a paper on Overseas Poetry.
It was not altogether easy. Sir Herbert Warren explained, to decide by what standard to judge the now, fresh, young growths of the Empire. Their own standards were not quite ours; universities,
academics, schools, coteries, conservatoires, a leisured and literary class, were abundant in Europe, but were only beginning to abound in the Dominions, But the Dominions, each and all, were great, poetic countries, with magnificent and varied scenery, though much of it still lacked association: splendid races in the nmkitig, though not yet fully made. Their poetry had passed the earliest stages; under the influence ok Imperialism it had common charac(eristics, the restlessness, the fever, tho cleverness ot modern cities along with the freedom of the wide open spaces. It was still largely an open-air poetry, the poetry of men of action and movement-, tinged with tho British love and spirit of sport, to-day deeply dyed with the spirit of war. It showed three main notes, love of tho new home, love ot the old home, and love of the Empire which included both.
He would begin with Canada, whoso poetry had undoubtedly a colour and character of its own. It might be found in the “ Oxford Book of Canadian Poetry,” edited in 1313 by one who was yesterday a leading living Canadian poet, bub was no longer so— Wilfred. Campbell, certainly a poet of Empire, whose
England, England, England, Girdled by ocean and skies. And the power of a world and tho heart of a race, And a hope that never dies.
was a fine poem of Empire. Other Canadian poets were Bliss Carman, with a poet’s love of the sea; his two cousins, Charles G. D. Roberts and Theodore Roberts, Archibald Lampman and Duncan C. Scott. Canada too had her French poetry; lx>uis Frechette, the most conspicuous, was the heir of .Franco and* of Victor Hugo, as Bliss Carman was the heir ot England ’ and ok Tennyson. A delicious blond of both was the work of William H. Drummond.who did not forget the forests and the lakes, tho habitant and the voyageur, half French, half English, and could also strike, and strike
well, the Imperial note. A little poem which gave the feeling ok Canada and the Canadian background
was “ The Whitethroat,” by Mr. Theodore Hand :—
Shy bird ok tho silver arrows of song, That cleave our Northern air so clear, Thy notes prolong—prolongI listen, I hear:
“ I—love—dear—Canada, ’Canada! Canada! ” There were also tho Senior Chaplain to the Canadian Forces, Canon F. G. Scott, ok Quebec, who camo over with the first Canadian Force in 1914, and had boon at the front over since: Mr. Robert Service, author of the 11 Rhymes of a Red Cross Man ” ; and an attractive French name—Lieutenant A. S. Bourinot.
Australia.
Australian poetry had a history of about a century. Adam Lindsay Gordon’s poetry and philosophy had given a ply to Australian literature which still persisted. Ok the younger generation, George Essex Evans, a Welshman, who went out to Queensland in 1881, seemed the most real and comprehensive Australian poet of his generation. He sang
Not as tho songs of other lands
* Her song shall bo
Where dim her purple shore-line stands, Above tho sea.
Her song is silence : unto her
Its mystery clings;
Silence is tho interpreter
OI deeper things;
O for sonorous Voice and strong To change that silence into song, To give that melody release, Which sleeps in the deep heart of peace With folded wings.
Then there was the most characteristic and up-to-date and realistic Australian poem, “ The Songs of a Sentimental Bloke,” by C. J. Dennis, 1015, whose work was real poetry, a charming old story told in a new way. New Zealand poetry, too, promised well. Was not Now Zealand there-? Ask Mr. Harris, whose “ New Zealand's Lament"" moved him well nigh to tears.
South Africa hud a Kipling in Cullen Gouldsbury, who died at Tanga in August, 1916:—•
How broad thy love, how big thy reverence!
Mjreh hast thou given us ere thy going hence, Now take what wo may give and leave tho rest— Take earth of ours thy world-wide Church hath blest:
Sleep, body, by our sea, beneath our stars 1 Go, soul, to peace in honour from our wars!
So sang of him another very different South African poet, the Bev. Arthur Shearlcy Cripps, who was as it Livingstone were fused with Kebto in a. strange dual personality, and writing ot Kipling and Bhodcs.
The lecturer mentioned many others. The Empire, so vast,various,splcndid.could not kail to have its poets. We could see its promise and potentialities through the eyes of t he ” oversea singers.” Thero was another overseas poetry also, which was always ours, doubly, trebly ours to-day—tho poetry ok the United States. America had her poets to-day, older and younger. One of these, Alan Seeger, had loved, life and “ honour more ” :—
But I've a rendezvous with Death, And I to my pledged word am true ;
I shall not fail that rendezvous.
He had not failed it. Young America would not fail it. Nor would older .America. Read tho "" Red Flower?1 issued in the last few days by Dr. Henry Van Dyke—that faithful, linn, yet fervent minister and minstrel.

HUMANITIES IN WAR TIME.
POETRY AND FICTION.
Last Tuesday wo dealt with history, memoirs, politics, war, and in general with subjects, other than technical, the study of which should “ help us all to play a worthy part in tho campaign for higher national efficiency.” Knowledge, we have been told, is power ; and the publishers, who have joined together to promote their “ book fortnight "" with the aim of increasing bookbuvers from a few hundred thousand to a number something nearer the 45 millions of our population, are helping to increase power by spreading knowledge. But knowledge is not all ; power is not all.
At this moment we have before our eyes the spectacle of immense power and hoarded knowledge doing their best to wreck the world. Human progress, human happiness depend upon something else than knowledge leading to power and power crashing into self-assertion. We may plainly see, indeed, how knowledge and power can betray each other, unless they are tempered, sweetened, and guided by other forces. And for a nation which is prepared to spend its all in the defence of another ideal than that it is not merely advisable, it is a plain duty to prosecute the studies that foster the ideal of amenity, good will, justice—in a word, humanity. The connexion between humanity and “ the humanities'” is more than verbal. The fullness of life comes not only through tho literature of knowledge and the power that knowledge gives. It is an equal duty, an equal wisdom to-cultivate, deepen, and enrich our lives and aims by tho literature of imagination, of beauty, ot spiritual enlargement, and exaltation.
National Home-Reading Union.
The lists issued by tho publishers who have joined in tho “ book fortnight ""and the announcements of other publishers make a useful guide to the best of current literature. The choice of a good bookseller, moreover, who understands and appreciates the wares in which he deals, is a necessary provision for the would-be reader ; while those who are humble enough to consider themselves more or loss beginners in tho good habit or reading (and many who are not beginners as well) may be counselled to avail themselves of the National Home-Reading Union. This energetic and knowledgablo body has lately begun to issue a scries of pamphlets (Is. net each) which arc valuable not only for the introductiqns they offer to the study of this or that author or subject, but for the classified bibliographies in each pamphlet. To Mr. J. W. Mackail’s “ William Morris ” and Mr. F. W. Moorman’s “ Shakespeare ” there have recently been added an excellent essay on “ Style and Composition” by Professor Hastings Crossley, and a fascinating introduction to tho study of British folk-songs and folk-lore by Sir Laurence and Lady Gomme.
Some Wab Books.
_ We arc concerned to-day principally with the literature of imagination ; but before inspecting the season’s books of poetry, of belles-lettres, and of fiction, we may glance at one or two important volumes belonging either to the literature ok knowledge or coming somewhere between the two. A notable war-book is Mr. Philip F. E. Schuler’s “ Australia in Arms ” (F. Unwin, 12s. fid. net), which, with the help of admirable illustrations, plans, tables, and so forth, puts on record in worthy style the training of the Australian troops, their doings in Egypt and on the Suez Canal, and their heroic achievements and sufferings in Gallipoli. The war, again, has filled many people with a desire to know more about our great and mysterious Ally, Russia; and a glimpse at tho greatness and infinite variety of Russia may be obtained from Miss M. A. Czaplicka’s remarkable travel book, “My Siberian Year” (Mills and Boon, IDs. 6d.). To Russian fiction wo shall come later ; but a sidelight on the country which Miss Czaplicka describes may be obtained from one or two of the stories in the second series of “ Talcs by Polish Authors ” recently translated by Else C. M. Bcneeke and Marie Busch (Blackwell, 5s. net).
The great questions of nationalism and internationalism, which are now occupying many thoughtful minds, may be studied to better advantage than ever before in three of this season’s books. In “ Europe Unbound,” by Lisle March Phillipps (Duckworth, 6s. net), and “ Nationalism and Internationalism : The Culmination of Modern History,"" by Ramsay Muir (Constable, 4s. 6d. net), two very able writers consider the great conflict of ideals which now divides Europe, trace the historical development of tho conceptions of law and justice, of the existence of national States, and the recognition of a unity of Europe, and show how they are brought to a test by the war. In “ Tho Monroe Doctrine : An Interpretation ” (Duckworth, 10s. 6d. net) Dr. Albert Bushnell Hart “ offers the only comprehensive account of the Monroe Doctrine in all its phases—that is to say, of the whole attitude of America to the world outside,” and deduces the conclusion ’ that tho United States, having already sacrificed its isolation, must be prepared to take an active part in tho conflicts of the future. And before we pass on to the study of' literature, one other important book must be mentioned : Mr. E. S. Russell’s “ Form and Functions : A Contribution to the History of Animal Morphology ” (Murray, 10s. 6d. net), a searching and fascinating inquiry into evolution, heredity, life itself.
“ Belles-Lettres ” and Criticism.
In tercentenary year it is natural to look first of all at the Shakespearian literature of the season. “ The Book of Homage to Shakespeare,""’ put forth by Dr. Israel Gollancz under the auspices of the Tercentenary Committee (Oxford University Press, 21s. net) is perhaps a luxury, though many of tho contributions, English and foreign, are so valuable as to demand republication in a cheaper form. “ Shakespeare’s England ” (Oxford University Press, 25s. net) is a book all but indispensable to readers of Shakespeare, so various and accurate is the information that it contains upon the life and manners of his age. Other studies of Shakespeare have been many. Some arc general ; some arc devoted to special points, like Sir E. Maunde Thompson’s "" Shakespeare’s Handwriting ” (Oxford University Press, 7s. 6d. net), and Sir Archibald Gcikio's “ The Birds of Shakespeare "" (MacLchoso, 3s. 6d. net) ; but one that perhaps deserves special attention is “ Tho English Drama in the Age of Shakespeare ” (Sidgwiek and Jackson, 18s. net), a translation of part of the monumental history of the modern drama by Professor W. Creizcnacli, of Cracow, whose special achievement it is to treat the Elizabethan drama not as a matter of pure literature, but in its relation to the politics, social history, religion, and other forces of its age. Lighter entertainment may be found in the Studio’s special number, “ Shakespeare in Pictures ” (5s. net), which sets before us the history of Shakespeare illustration.
Of other literary criticism there has been no small quantity published, among the most important volumes being a reprint: “ Poetry and the Renascence of Wonder ” (Jenkins, 5s. net), by Theodore Watts-Dunton, tho eminent Victorian critic, whose “ Life-Liters,” by Thomas Hake and A. Compton-Rickctt, has also been published recently (Jack ). The opinions of that strange and interesting creature Lafcadio Hearn have been issued under the title of “ Interpretations of Literature ” (Heinemann, 30s. net). Mr. William Watson, the poet, has published a “ plea for the older ways "" in writing—not wholly unnecessary, no doubt, in these days of daring and sometimes brutal literary experiment—under the
title of “ Pencraft ” (Lane, 3a 6d. net) • and among a large number of other critical works we may mention Messrs. Nisbet’s little series of “ Writers of the Day ” (Is. 3d. each net), in which Kipling, Hardy, Bennett, Shaw, and other eminent authors arc, briefly characterized. It is natural, perhaps, that in times like these, which stir all minds to"" thought, expression should be found through the medium of the essay ; and English literature’s proud heritage in the essay has been suggested recently by the republication, under able editorship, pi Henry Fielding’s once famous “ Covent Garden Journal ” (Oxford University Press, 21s. net).
That tho art of essay-writing is not lost is proved by several recent publications : Sir. W. Warde Fowler’s remarkable “ Essays in Brief for War-Time ” (Blackwell, 2s. 6d. not) ; Mr. R. W. Mackcnna’s “ The Adventure of Death ’’ (Murray, 3s.- Cd. net) ; Mr. Galsworthy’s “ A Sheaf ” (Heinemann, 5s. net) ; and Mr. E. V. Lucas’s charming mixture of grave and gay, “Cloud and Silver” (Methuen, 5s. net) ; while another recent issue of essays inspired by the war is M. Maeterlinck’s “ The Wrack of the Storm,’"" translated by M. A. Teixeira do Mattos (Methuen, 5s. net). With these, too, may Bo associated the anthology of prose and verso made by the Poet Laureate (Longmans, 5s. net)—distinctly a book to uplift and console in times of stress ; while Mr. A. Macphail’s very interesting anthology, “ Tho Book of Sorrow ” (Oxford University Press, 6s. net), has its obvious bearing on the present times.
To belles-lettres, again, rather than to biography, belongs Mr. W. B. Yeats’s exquisite little volume of “Reveries over Childhood and Youth "" (Macmillan, 6s. net). To the study of Eastern thought and art, as remote from our own, yet as necessary to Britons, especially among Europeans, an interesting addition is Dr. Ananda K. Coomaraswamy’s “ Buddha and the Gospel of Buddhism,” with its fine illustrations (Harrap, 15s. net). Of Portugal we may learn much from the anthology “ Portugal,” with English versions by G. Young (Oxford University Press, 7s. 6d. net). For reference there are our faithful friends, Chambers’s “ Cyclopædia of English Literature ” (31s. 6d. net), and “ Chambers’s Encyclopædia ” (£5 net, 10 vols.) ; and along one of the byways of tho study of literature wo are pleasantly taken by Mr. W. Longman’s “ Tokens of the Eighteenth Century connected with Booksellers and Bookmakers ” (Longmans, 6s. net).
Poetry.
Tho war has brought into being an immense amount of poetry. Many a young man who never guessed that ho was a poot has been stirred by his experiences at the front to expression in verse; and while volumes of this character are too many to enumerate, a good bookseller could recommend the best, and some day, no doubt, a publisher will issue an anthology of them. Meanwhile, the reprinting of the poetry of the past has been carried on if pot more widely, certainly not less so than in time of peace.
A volume of marked if special interest is Dr. Milton Perceval's Poetical Ballads illustrating the Administration of Sir Robert Walpole ” (Oxford University Press, 8s. Cd. net); and tho famous “ Ben Gaultier Bal'ads ” have been issued in a new illustrated edition (Blackwood, 5s. net).
Among the poets of our own day, readers may note tho collected poems of James Elroy Flecker (Seeker, 7s. Cd. net), the brilliant singer who died recently; a collected edition of the poems of Mr. Alfred Noyes (Blackwood, 10s. net); and the addition to the Golden Treasury of a volume of selections from the poetry of Mr. Thomas Hardy (Macmillan, 2s. 6dL), who, great as a prose-writer, is held by some to be even greater as a poet. New poems have been published by Mr. Masefield (“ Sonnets and Poems,” published by tho author, 3s. 6d. not); Mr. W. B. Yeats (“ Responsibilities,” Macmillan. 6s. net); Mr. Maurice Hewlett, who in "" The Song of the Plow ” (Heinemann, 6s. net) sings “ the song of English history as it might have appeared to Hodge himself ” ; Miss Evelyn Underhill, who in “ Theophanies ” (Dent, 3s. 6d.) has revealed anew the mysticism that is tho spring and substance of her poetic genius ; Mr. William Watson, whose “ Retrogression ” (Lane, 3s. - 6d. net) contains, as it has been said, “ verse for the mind, not the soul ” ; Mr. A. 8. Cripps, in “ Pilgrim’s Joy ” (Blackwell, 2s. 6d. net); and Mr. John Oxenham, who has followed up his last year’s “ All’s Well” with a similarly hearty and widely appealing volume, “The King’s Highway” (Methuen, Is. not).
Miss Irene Rutherford McLeod has issued a new and striking book of poems, “ Swords for Life ” (Chatto, 2s. 6d. net); and “ Lustra of Ezra Pound ” (Mathews, 5s. net), and Mr. D. H. Lawrence’s “ Amores ” (Duckworth, 5s. net) will give readers a glimpse into some of the tendencies of modem poetry. Finally, wo may note a new volume of prose translations from his own Bengali poems by Sir Rabindranath Tagore, whose "" Fruit-Gathering’’ (Macmillan, 4s. Cd. net) is a worthy successor to his much-treasured “ Gitanjali.”
Fiction.
A notable feature of the year’s publishing is the number of translations from the Russian. Their merit is very various, and at present it is impossible to form anything like a satisfactory “ library ” of them; but they are all worth the attention of readers. Mrs. Constance Garnett has begun a translation of the tales of Tchekov, of which two volumes out of eight have already appeared (Chatto, 2s. net each). To tho English versions of Kuprin has been added “A Slav Soul, and other stories” (Constable, 5s. net); Korolenko is introduced to us by “ Tho Murmuring Forest ” (Duckworth, Gs.); Sologub’s “ Little Domon ” has been followed byon almost equally remarkable book, “ The Created Legend ” (Seeker, 5s. not); Andregev's “ The Little Angel ” is to be had for a shilling (Hodder and Stoughton); and while Mr. J. M. Murry has published an interesting study of Dostoievsky, a novel by his daughter, L. Dostoieffsko, “ The Emigrant ” (Constable, 5s. net), has thrown light on the position of educated women in Russia.
As for our English fiction, it is so well advertised and the libraries are so alive to its quality and kind that there is little need to be particular in these columns. Among the many novels dealing with various aspects of the war, to “ Mr. Birtling Secs it Through,” which we mentioned last week, there might be added Mrs. Hamilton’s “ Dead Yesterday ” (Duckworth, Gs.), Miss Rose Macaulay’s “ Non-Combatants and Others ” (Hodder and Stoughton, 5s. net), and Mr. Hugh do SiSlincourt’s “ A Soldier of Life ” (Constable, 5s. net); besides innumerable tales of adventure and active service, at the head of which como tho stories of Ian Hay, of Boyd Cable, and Sapper.
Our most eminent novelists have not been barren. A glance at the lists shows Mr. Arnold Bennett’s “ The Lion’s Shore ” (Cassell, Gs.); Mr. Maurice Howlett’s "" Love and Lucy ” (Macmillan, 5s.- net); Mr. W. W. Jacobs’s “ The Castaways ” (Hodder and Stoughton, 5s, net); Mr. Temple Thurston’s “ Tho FiveBarred Gato ” (Hodder and Stoughton, 5s. net); Mr. ""W. J, Locke’s “ The Wonderful Year ” (Lane, 6s.); Mrs. Belloc Lowndes’s “ Lilia ” (Hutchinson, Gs.); and Mr. Algernon Blackwood’s “ The Wave ” (Macmillan, 5s. net). Lucas Malet has put out two books, one her own, “ Damaris ” (Hutchinson, Gs.), tho other, “ The Tutor’s Story,” begun by her father, Charles Kingsley, and finished by herself (Smith, Elder, 6s. not); and Mr. Cunninghame Graham has issued what he declares, alas I to be his lust volume, “ Brought Forward "" (Duckworth, 6s.).
Not to bo passed over by any lover of good fiction are the “ Collected Tales ” of Mr. Barry Pain, of which one volume has been published (Seeker, 5s. net). The strange and brilliant work of tho American author, O. Henry, is being issued in a number of volumes (Nash, 3s. Cd. each); and a hearty laugh may bo had out of a new humorist, Sir. Herbert Jenkins, tho author of “ Bindlo ” (Jenkins, 5s. net). For the rest (and they are many), the advice of librarians and booksellers and the publishers’ announcements should bo sufficient guide to readers who regard novela as something more than a more pastime.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS101779333/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=f53fbe69

CANADIAN AND AUSTRALIAN VERSE.
•
'
'
Sir Herbert Warren, Professor of Poetry, delivered at Oxford on Saturday the second of two lectures on the Poetry of the Empire, dealing with the writers of Canada and Australia.
The Professor proposed only to deal with what might be called the “ Imperial ” poetry oi the two countries. But this he would interpret in a wide sense. He recommended two books, the “ Oxford
Book of Canadian Verse,” selected by Mr. Wilfred Campbell, and the “Golden Treasury of Australian Verse,” edited by Mr. Bertram Stevens. In certain broad features tile poetry of Canada and Australia resembled each other. In both the early poetry was largely immigrant; in the latter halt of the century the native poetry had steadily aud strikingly increased. But Canada was of the north, Australia essentially southern ; the Red Indian was more romantic and picturesque than the “ black fellow."" Canada contained a large French province and element, and had also a huge neighbour, whose influence could not but affect her profoundly. Australia was more homogeneous and more isolated. The Imperial life of both lands might be said to have begun with poets born about 1860.
The1 Canadian Spirit.
Mr. Wilfred Campbell was certainly a poet ok Empire; witness his “England,” beginning:—
“England, England, England, girdled by ocean and skies.
And the power of a world and the heart ok a race, And a hope that never dies.""
Contemporary with him was C. G. Douglas Roberts. His “ Canada ” was a striking poem. Another poet, Theodore Roberts, struck what was more the note to-day in “ The Reckoning,"" in which, speaking of England as “ the little island in the foggy sea,"" he warned the world that “They who would reckon with England, must reckon with England’s sons.” Another Canadian, Bliss Carman, gave, in his “ Low Tide on Grand Pre,” very sympathetically, the feeling of Canadian scenery which had appealed so strongly to Longfellow, and could be found also in Archibald Lanipman, and in Theodore Rand’s poem on the Whitethroat, with its refrain;—
“I — love — dear — Canada, Canada, Canada.""
To feel the country too wo must look at her French poetry. Louis Frechette was the heir ok France and of Victor Hugo, as Bliss Carman was the heir of England and Tennyson. But there was yet another vein of verse, represented by William H. Drummond, ok Scotch family, but born in Ireland, who had gone to Canada as a boy and lived in the back-woods. Though he became a Professor of Medical Jurisprudence, he never forgot the forests and lakes, the habitant and the voyageur, half French, half English. “ Little Lac Grenier ” or “ Johnnie Courteau ” was poetry of the Empire.
A very representative poet of Canada was Canon Frederick George Scott, of Quebec, now serving as a chaplain at the front, from which he had sent striking poems. His “ Hymn of Empire,” made famous by being quoted by Mr. Chamberlain during the South African War, true and great Imperial poetry, and echoing Tennyson’s denunciation of the “ craven fear of being great,” struck the note of Canada’s strength, and also of her high and noble aims. His recent poems from the front, “ On the Rue do Bois,"" printed in The Times, and “ Requiescant,"" and “ O Canada, my country and my love 1 ” carried still further the same ideals.
The Thbbe Notes of Empire.
There were three notes ok the Empire as found in Canadian poetry: Love of the new homo, Canada. Love ok the old home, England. Love and loyalty to the vast whole which united both, and linked the past and the present to the future, the Empire itself. Ik they crossed.the Pacific they would find these same three notes floating out to meet them over the southern waves. Australia was no less full, perhaps even more full, of poetry. There, too, it had begun a century ago. In Australia poetry had gone hand in hand will, public life and journalism. A characteristic pioneer was Sir Henry Parkes, and another was Adam Lindsay Gordon.
But the real poetry ok the Empire naturally belonged more to younger men. One ok the most conspicuous was a Welshman, George Essex Evans, author, ot the “Secret Key.” In “An Australian Symphony ” he had suggested what Australian poetry might be. The same opportunity had been found by an Irishman, Mr. John Sandes. Yet another Imperial poet was Mr. Douglas Sladen. A still younger poet, Mr. Archibald Strong, had brought the earliest and latest ideals of Empire together in “ Sonnets of file Empire,” one of winch, “ Australia to England.” had appeared in The Times. New Zealand was excellently represented by Mr. William Peinbcr Reeves. Australia too, like Canada, had her spiritual poets, such as the devoted Bishop of Carpentaria. Dr. Gilbert White, whose hymn “ Australia ” had been quoted with much effect at St. Paul’s by the Archbishop of Canterbury.
Time forbade him to include India in his survey of the Empire, and particularly such poems as “ The Trumpet"" of Rabindranath Tagore.
We were living in a tremendous time. “ On us the ends ok the earth had come.” “ World-might or going under” was our socmen’s motto. “Worldright or going under ” our own. These sorrows, these ' struggles, these sacrifices, this anguish and agony were the birth-throes of the Empire.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS185927030/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=050e33a8
Null,The Old Testament And Arabian Poetry,The Times,1914-Jan-14,"London, England","THE OLD TESTAMENT AND ARABIAN POETRY.
SOME INTERESTING COMPARISONS.
' ■
Sir Charles Lyall read a paper to the Royal Asiatic Society yesterday- on "" The Relation of the Old Arabian Poetry to the Hebrew Literature of the Old Testament.” Sir Mortimer Durand was in the chair, and the lecture room of the society was crowded.
Snt Charles pointed out that Hebrew poetry and Arabic poetry were in outward form very different* Though the languages of these two great historic branches of the Semitic stock were nearly akin, there were great divergences between them. Arabic prosody, he said, bore a very close resemblance to that of the Greeks, whereas Hebrew verse might rather be compared, to the rough Saturnian rhythms of the early Latin poets, or the chants of our northern forefathers, recently imitated by the Poet Laureate in his Christmas ode in I Tic. Times. Turning from form to substance, they found & most close and extrao rdinary resemblance between the old poetry of Israel and the compositions of Northern and Central Arabia in the classical period, and the great gap of 12 or 13 centuries seemed to vanish entirely.
It was only in the first great period of the history of Israel, ending soon after the establishment of the monarchical system, that close resemblance between the literature of Israel and that of Arabia could be expected, because only during that time were the conditions of the two people similar. It was remarkable how few were the fragments of Hebrew poetic composition which had survived to us from it. Many poems of the period quoted in prose literature had perished, and its two outstanding monuments were the Song of Deborah and the Lament of David on the death of Saul and Jonathan. Both of these poems were strongly and markedly Arabian in feeling, in texture, and in expression, with the exception of the. theophany with which the first of them opened. The Arabs of classical times and their descendants, the Bedvtin of our present day, were one of the races least touched by the solemnities of religious awe. Sir Charles proceeded to compare the Song of Deborah with an Arabic poem celebrating a great battle in the sixth century, in which the tribe of Amir ib n Sa-sa-ah routed a great combination which the neighbouring tribes of Central Arabia brought against it. Similarly he compared David’s Lament with a dirge by Duraid, son of AS'Simmah, on his brother Abdallah. He based on these parallelisms the theory that when these ancient poems of Israel were composed the contemporary Arabs of the east and south were making verse of the same kind. There was no reason to Sose that the civilisation of the Israelites in the »r of the two historic periods was superior to that of their cousins, the sons of Midian, Ishmael and
Edom. Apart from the mission of Israel as founder ok a world-religion and his unique capacity for the reception and development of religious ideas there was little difference between him and his neighbours. But in the three or four centuries ending in the return from captivity there was very great religious advance. The Book of Job belonged to the time of the second Isaiah. The writer went outside the limits of Israel and plaited the scene of his colloquies in Arabia. This unplied that in his time it was believed that wise men capable of carrying on such discussions could be found, there. The reasonable conclusion was that there were then poets in Arabia who dealt with just the same subjects as their successors nearly 1,000 years later, and handled them in approximately the same way. Arabic poetic art in the time of tribal Israel as well as in the later literary period, probably covered much the same subjects as it did at the beginning of the Islamic age. The sole reason why none of these compositions of ancient times were now extant probably was that they were not committed to writing, but perished with the human memories in which they were preserved.

Null,Poetry And The Cinematograph,The Times,1913-Dec-09,"London, England","POETRY AND THE CINEMATOGRAPH.
The Poetry Society, in its efforts to encourage a love of poetry in all classes, is apparently quite willing to utilize any legitimate means, and it will be interesting to see whether anything practical comes of the demonstration of “ speaking pictures ” which was given before its members yesterday by the Clarendon Film Company.
There have been efforts in the past to adapt wellknown poems for cinematograph purposes—a version of “ Maud ’’ was produced three years ago. But on such occasions the spoken word was omitted, and from tho point of view of encouraging a love of poetry the value of the film was little. Now, however, by a clever process of elaborate synchronization between the moving picture and the living voice the Clarendon Film Company have made a decided advance on past productions. We are not quite sure that the Poetry Society will agree with the company as to what constitutes the sort of poetry which it is desired to spread among the poeple. The only picture which dealt with a poem of any real pretension yesterday was that based on Tennyson’s “ The Gardener’s Daughter,"" and this, strangely enough, was the one poem which was not recited. It is obvious, of course, that many of the better known poems are quite unsuitable for the purpose, and that the subject must be carefully chosen, but it was somewhat surprising to see that every picture presented yesterday touched on death in some aspect. From the point of view of synchronization, however, the films left nothing to bo desired.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS169279881/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=e712c2a4

' Lord Coleridge presided yesterday at the annual dinner of the Poetry Recital Society at the Hoiborn Restaurant.
Mr. Galloway Kyle (secretary) stated that letters expressing regret at inability to be present had been received from Lord Crewe, who was obliged to be at a political meeting at Winchester, the American Ambassador, the Duke of Argyll, Mr. E. W. Longfellow, Lord Edmund Talbot, Miss Isabel Swinburne, Mr. G. Locker Lampson, Mr. and Mrs. Humphry Ward, Sir L. Alma Tadema, Lord Avebury,

The Chairman proposed the toast of “The Immortal Memories of the British Poets,"" which was drunk In solemn silence.

It was, he thought, a happy idea which occurred to the authorities of that society to bid them assemble that night in pious memory of the great poets from whom they claimed descent or kinship. He did not know whether the Heralds’ College had investigated all their pedigrees. (Laughter.) He was not sure whether they were there to testify to the ’soundness of tho hereditary principle or the reverse. (Cheers and laughter.) It might be that they were all of them poets, either actual or potential. (Cheers and laughter.) This was said to be a material age, but it was pure sentiment which had brought them together. While the nation was proud of its deeds rather than of its words, still they must claim to surpass all other nations as a nation of great poets. (Cheers.) Truly wonderful had been the output of their poetry from Chaucer right down to the present day. He could not even conjecture an explanation of the wealth, the continuity, and the variety of their poetic thought.

Mr. Herbert Trench’s Poe
The author of Deirdre Wed and Other Poems (Methuen) has produced a little volume which bears on almost every page the stamp of genuine poetry- His inspiration is Celtic, like that of a whole young school now much in favour, but his endowment is much more solid, and his muse much more free from affectation, than is the case with most of tho Irish poets and poetesses of the day. In outline “ Deirdre Wed ” is a very old story, tho story of a tyrant's bride who falls in lovo with ono of tho victims of his injustice and escapes with him, after many adventures, into safety ; but it is told with such a mysterious charm of language, imagery, and music that wo can quite understand tho enthusiasm with which it is beginning to bo spoken of by tho lovers of poetry. Whether it is likely to be popular is quite another question; probably tho treatment will ho found too remote from common speech, and tho atmosphere too rarefied. Somo of tho “ other poems "" aro fine, end not wanting in simplicity, and tho concluding pago of “ Claviers at Night "" is like a great picture by Mr. Watts.
Other Verse.
We welcome tho new edition of tho Archbishop of Armagh’s poems, under tho title of The Finding of the Book and Other Poems (Hodder and Stoughton) ; a volume, as tho author says,11 scarcely so much another edition as another book."" Tho Archbishop's lyre has many notes, religious, ethical, fanciful, descriptive, and patriotic ; it is alwuysmolodious, always pleasant to hear. Nor is thoro any falling off in the section described as “ recently written "" ; witness tho poem first published in our own columns, “ Is War tho Only Thing that has no Good in it ? ""
Sir Lewis Morris lias issued a new volume (already in a second edition) under tho name of Harvest? Tide (Kegan Paul), tho date of his title-pago reminding him “ that he is no longer a writer of the 19th century alone."" His merits and his limitations have long been familiar, and both are conspicuous in the new book. Thoro is a curious poom called “ Apologia,"" in which he indicates
pretty plainly which of his brother versifiers it is that he does not admire; there is another in which, by talking of tho man “who sees life whole and secs it one,"" ho shows how boldly ho can borrow from Matthew Arnold ; while four lines further down, by bidding us “ put off alike tho tiger and the apo,"" ho shows us how Tennyson can bo assimilated with advantage. Still, it is bettor to echo the phrases of great minds in writing about things of good report than to evolve an eccentric style for tho purpose of rhapsodizing over impropriety. Sir Lewis Morris has always been "" on the side of tho angels "" in that respect. Tho popularity 1 his poems havo enjoyed is largely duo to this. ; They appeal to tho good instincts of ordinary people ; they arc easily understood ; aud the ideas which lio at their roots are never so original as to bo startling or to set in motion ""bewildering trains of thought. They ate read with pleasure by thousands who would never exert their minds sufficiently to road the groat poets, and probably they do good to thousands. Certainly, they cannot do them any harm.
Mr. VV. B. Yeats, a much-admired poet of tho neo-Celtic school, has published a thin new volume, ample in its margins, under tho title of The Shadowy Waters (Hodder and Stoughton). It seems to us that this wants just the qualities which “ Deirdre Wed "" possesses in abundance. Shadowiness, of which Mr. Yeats has enough and to spare, is not sufficient for poetry. Tho poet must havo something to say. On the other hand, Mr. F. E. Monoy-Coutts, in his tiny volume The Mystery of Godliness (John Lane), has a great deal to say, having to treat, in some two hundred stanzas, tho mystery, not of godliness only, but of tho universe. That the theologians, or even tho ordinary educated reader, will always agree with Mr. Money-Coutts is not to lie expected; but it is a satisfaction to find in these days a poem with some good hard thinking in it, especially when the thought is simply expressed in tho familiar four-lined stanza. With this little book we may mention a new English version, commendable from many points of view, of the lyric utterances of a great man, Mr. ’J. M. Morrison’s translation of tho Poems
of Leopardi (Gay aud Bird). Sad as they arc, Done can deny that tho canti of the greatest of modern Italian poets are abundantly well worth reading. Mr. Morrison’s seems to be a good and scholarly version.
Tho writer of Heartsease : A Cycle or Sono (David Nutt) might well havo called hor dainty volume “ An Englishwoman’s Levo Poems."" They would compare favourably with the muchadvertised "" Love Letters."" Hero is no violent striving after effect, but a charmingly sincere gift of emotion wedded to melodious verso. Tho metres aro varied with a good deal of technical skill, and this variety dispels anything like tho monotony which sometimes attends cycles of poems inspired by a single passion. The range of expression is not wide, but, within tho limits sho has set herself, the author of "" Heartsease "" lias produced verso of grace and distinction that lifts tho little book well out of tho common ruck.
Four volumes in a lighter key aro Mr. Anthony C. Deane’s New Rhymes for Old (Lane), tho new edition of Horace in Homespun, by the writer who calls himself “Hugh Haliburton"" (Blackwood), Burns rrom Heaven, by Hamish Hendry (Richards), and Miss Fowler's Love’s Argument and other Poems. Tho last shows tho pen of a facile and versatile writer ; “ Hugh Haliburton,” whoso book is already well known in tho north, is a genial humourist, applying Hoiatian standards—in Scotch verse—to the minor problems of modern life ; Mr. Hendry, though his volume is unequal, writes clover Scots; and Mr. Deane, as a parodist, is sometimes almost as good as Mr. Owen Seaman.
History.
Professor Lanciani's small volume, The Destruction of Ancient Rome; a Sketch of the History of the Monuments (Macmillan) is printed in America, and may lie tho substance of lectures delivered in that country. Anyhow it ismore summary and popular than the author’s former volumes, and it is written more exclusively from one point of view, being an attempt to answer tho question. How did tho glorious buildings of ancient Romd and tho Campagna fall into minor disappear, and who is responsible for tho destruction of tho works of art that abounded there within the memory ot history ? The interest of such a discussion is obvious, and no man could conduct it better than Signor Lanciani. It is a miserable story that ho tells, and one reads it with an uninterrupted feeling of depression. His main point is that, although tho various sieges of Romo by Alaric, Genseric, and others did immense harm to certain buildings, tho barbarians have far less to answer for than the Romans themselves, headed by Popes, cardinals, and great nobles, who through many centuries deliberately used tho ancient buildings as quarries out of which to build the new. The jiuthor, who gives chanter and verse for. his

interest.
Ml*. W. 6. Hazlitt some forty years ago published a history of Venice in four volumes, and this ho has now rewritten and issued in two stout octavos, under the title ot The VENETIAN REPUBLIC ; its Rise, its Growth, and its Fall (A. and C. Black). Some former books of the author have not prepossessed us in his favour, but in tho volumes before us he has produced a: serious work, and appears to have given considerable study to the masses of new material which havo been made accessible since I860. The researches of the late Mr. Rawdon Brown, and such publications as tho 30 or 40 volumes of tho diaries of Marino Sanuto (1496-1533)—to mention but two sources out of many—have entirely transformed the task which the modern historian of Venice must set himself. Of tills Mr. Hazlitt has been conscious, and, though probably it would bo easy to criticize his volumes in detail, they form tho most comprehensive history of Venice as yet accessible to English readers.
A separate and very romantic episode of Venetian history is delightfully told in tho quarto volume Frangipani’s Ring, by the distinguished German writer and critic Henry Thotlo ; tho English translation by “ J. F. O. L."" is published
by Mr. Macqueen. Nine years ago, while he was working in St. Mark’s Library, some peasants brought to Herr Thodo an old inscribed gold ring which they had found in making some excavations in the Pordenoue region; and by a series of happy guesses, wonderfully confirmed by contemporary documents in the library, especially tho voluminous diaries of Marino Sanuto, tho fortunate new owner identified his ring with one that had been lost in tho year 1513 by that deadly enemy of Venice, Count Christoph Frangipani, commander of the Imperial forces that were then invading tho northern territories ot the Republic. Tho discovery led him to investigate the life of the Count, the story of his marriage with the sister of the celebrated Cardinal Matthew Lang, his capture by the Venetians, his long imprisonment, his wife’s romantic devotion, and his death ; and the result is a charming book, full of new matter and unpublished letters, the whole forming a most vivid page of the history of Venice and her neighbours in the great days of her glory.
Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice has republished in book form, embellished with a couple of portraits and a map, two articles from t he Edinburgh Review on Chaiu.es, Duke of Brunswick (Longmans). If ho is ambitious of an historical reputation, ho had bettor have left them anonymous. Like most articles in the two great quarterlies, they exhibit a wide range of knowledge in relation to tho subject. The author has read many memoirs, &c., besides ordinary histories, and ho has some grasp of tho period he is dealing with. Like most periodical literature, these articles contain crude opinions and judgments running into extremes, because epigram is for such compositions almost necessary, and space is wanting to tone down exaggerated outlines of action or character. The shadow of Macaulay is perhaps still over tho Edinburgh Review. Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice’s work reminds one of Macaulay’s famous essays, both in its merits and in its defects. There is no direct imitation of stylo; but there is the same effective sketching of the general aspect of things and the same skill in relieving graver delineations by personal touches. Unfortunately, also, there is tho
same, or greater, lack ot accuracy in illustration, tho same ignoring, for the sake o£ rhetorical effect, oE qualifications and limitations such as an historian should in honesty introduce. Tho writer ok an ephemeral article may perhaps bo forgiven for not verify ing his incidental references. An author who publishes an historical work under his own name can hardly be excused for leaving them incorrect. As a brief sketch of a man who played a great part in his time, and might have played a greater had ho been mado of sterner stuff, this little book is interesting, but it is not a permanent contribution to history.
Mr. I1'. M. Hueffer’s The Cinque Ports : a Historical and Dsscrutive Becord (Blackwood) is an attractive volume, well illustrated by Mr. William Hyde, on tho history of one of the most interesting regions of England. Mr. Hueffer indeed makes no claim to bo considered an authoritative historian ; he presents himself, almost too avowedly, as tho literary man; but he knows how to make good use of what has been already discovered ;.nd written, and his historical narrative is not amiss. Mr. Hyde, who had already proved tho poetical qualities of his art in his illustrations to Mr. Meredith’s poems, has contributed some really charming drawings, especially those of Bomney Marsh and of tho salt-flats near Bye.
Miscellanea.
A capital selection of Cartoons by Sir John Tenniel has been issued in a half-crown volume (Punch office, Bouverie-street). There is no necessity to tell what qualities of drawing, what humour, aud what apposite illustration of events are to be found in the great cartoonist’s work; it is too well-known to need recommendation. When Buskin said of him that ho had raised tho art of caricature to a
higher plane, he only said what every one who has studied the cartoons must have felt vaguely
tiidicd havo felt vaguely, oven though thoy could not express in words I what they felt. All tho pictures in this volume
have a double value—artistic and historical. Tho latter will increase as time goes on, and, if our children and grandchildren admire the drawing less highly than we do, they will only proclaim themselves poorer than their parents in taste and appreciation.
The Jew in London, by C. Russell and H. 8. Lewis (Fisher Unwin).-—A careful investigation, mado for tho Toynbee Trustees, of tho statistics and conditions of Jewish life in East London. A book of great interest, written without bias of any kind, and accompanied by a really wonderful statistical map of East London, showing tho proportions of Jewish and Gentile population over a largo area.
Readings in the Paradiso of Dante (Macmillan).—These two volumes complete Mr. Warran Vernon’s elaborate aud line-by-line study of tho Divine Comedy ; a book which has already established its position as an indispensable help to tho English student of Dante. There is a brightlywritten introduction by tho Bishop of Ripon.
Domesticities, by E. V. Lucas (Smith, Elder, and Co.) ; “ a little book of household impressions,"" lightly-touched essays on meals, clothes, walks, the books to read, and many other matters of daily concern. Tho anther's genial humour has already mado him a general favourite with readers, and this bright little book will confirm his position. ___________",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS218425468/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=20fbe3c6

Poetry.
L
The pressure on our space makes it Impossible for us to review at length any large proportion of the multitude of books which pour from the press in the last three months of the year. The following short notes, however, may be of service ,to intending readers :—
Mr.Laurence Binyon’s Odes (The Unicorn Press).—A thin volume of highly-accomplished verse, somewhat in the manner of Mr. Bridges ; the subjects chiefly from classical or medieval
story. The best is perhaps “ The Death of
nest 18 Tristram*.’^ which, if it does not disnlace Matthew
. :
rnosovey poemrom our affections, at least gives a new and beautiful reading to an immortal story of passion.
The Professor, and other Poems, by A. C. Benson (Lane).—Scholarly and sincere, the first part showing a genuine lyrical gift. The longest poem, a blank verse monologue put into the mouth of the poet Gray, is an interesting piece of psychological analysis.
Titania, and other Poems, by A. 8. Cripps (E. Mathews).—A small volume by one of the group of poets who came out of Oxford a few years ago. The songs are charming, and sonnets like “ Perdita ” and “ On the Graves of a War ” have a pathetic note that is not common in the verse of to-day.
The Wild Knight, and other Poems, by Gilbert Chesterton (Grant Richar ds).—Clever .generally pessimistic, and sometimes, as in “The Wild Knight,” verging on the grotesque.
The Prayer of St. Scholastica, and other Poems, by Lady Lindsay (Kegan Paul.—Graceful and sincerely felt, but striking no new note of feeling or melody.
Gisli Suksson, a Drama and Poems by the late Helen Barmby (Constable).—These are “poems of the old Norse days,” and Professor York
Powell, an expert and enthusiast for everything Icelandic, writes a highly laudatory preface to them. Miss Barmby died too soon, and the little book is primarily a memorial of what its editor calls “ the busy, curious brain, and the brave, gentle heart ’ ’ of one who might have done great things had time been allowed her.
The Handy Man, and Other Verse, by Harold Begbie (Grant Richards).—War poems and songs by a clever admirer, not to say imitator, of Mr. Rudyard Kipling.
Poems ; Chiefly Sacred, by Dr. Chadwick, Bishop of Deny (Hodder and Stoughton).—Tho Bishop of Derry writes in the vein of his distinguished \ predecessor ; his poems are for the most part happily free from the commonplace from which clerical poets seem to find it so difficult to escape.
Three small volumes of translations in verse deserve notice:—
An Echo of Greek Songs, Englished by W. H. D. Rouse (Dent), is a dainty little collection of epigrams from the anthology in which the writer acknowledges an occasional debt of Mr. Mackall.
Songs of Modern Greece, by G. F. Abbott (Cambridge University Press), is more important, being perhaps the best existing collection of modern Greek songs with literal English translations and good notes. The .book is indispensable to all intelligent travellers in Greece.
Songs from the Book of Jaffir (Macmillan) is an anonymous collection of clever verse and prose, professing to be adapted from the Persian. Bindra, the jester, who contributes
half the sdngs, ought to take his place in the train of Omar Khayyam.
The following are noteworthy, among col¬
lections and new editions :—
The Oxford Book of English Verse, 1250 to 1900 (Clarendon Press).—A volume of 1,000 pages, yet convenient to handle, because of the excellence of the Clarendon Press paper. The editor is Mr. Quiller-Couch, who has “ set his heart on choosing the best.” Strange to say he only gives three pages out of his thousand to Chaucer, while Bishop King has five, Thomas Campion seven, and Mr. Meredith fourteen. But in the making of anthologies, quot homines, tot sentential.
The Treasury of Irish Poetry in the English Tongue, edited by Stopford A. Brooke and T. W. Rolleston (Smith, Elder, and Co.).—This is an authoritative and almost final collection such as we might expect from the hand of two skilled critics and Nationalist Irishmen. The book is edited by Sir Charles Gavan Duffy, and among the editors of sections we find the name of Mr. John O’Leary. This is appropriate enough in a book of which a large part is passionately anti-English ; but it is only fair to say that the book contains also poems by Mr. Aubrey de Vere, Mr. Lecky, and other believers in
the Union. Politics apart, there is no question that the collection contains a large amount of genuine and delightful poetry. We are only somewhat surprised that some of the noble and intensely Irish verse of Miss Emily Lawless is not among it.
The Early Poems of Alfred Tennyson (Methuen),by John Churton Collins.—Mr. Collins edits Tennyson as he would edit a Greek classic, giving the various readings and necessary notes in explanation. This and the introduction show a wealth of Tennysonian learning to which no other critic could pretend. Charmingly printed and bound, and well illustrated by Mr. W. E. F. Britten.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS201648027/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=dc011ef0
Null,The Poetry And Letters Of T. E. Brown,The Times,1900-Oct-30,"London, England","The Poetry and Letters of T. E. Brown.
The author of “ Fo’c’sle Yarns ” was quite un-; mistakably a man of rare parts and gifts, though; his repute among his friends was evidently much higher, and no doubt deservedly much higher, than his public reputation. If tire estimate formed and recorded by his friends of his personality and genius is not exaggerated, he must have belonged by birthright to the immortals; but he never entered on
his inheritance. EEis life was uneventful; it is his character and qualities that interest. He was the son of a scholarly clergyman in the Isle of Man, and was educated at King William’s College. Nominated by Dean Gaisford to a servitorship at Christ Church, he there gained a brilliant double first, and, not being deemed eligible as a servitor to a studentship at Christ Church, he stood for and obtained a Fellowship at Oriel. But, apart
. . from his brilliant undergraduate career, he made no mark at Oxford. He married early and accepted the headmastership of the Crypt School at Gloucester. Thence he went to Clifton College as a colleague of the present Bishop of Hereford, and at Clifton the greater portion of his active life was spent. In his later years he spent much of his time in his native island, to which he was passionately attached, deeply loving its people, its scenery, its legends, its dialects, and its wild, seafaring life.
There is not much in. a life so devoid of incident to arrest the attention and engage the interest of those who did not know him- We must look for the real Brown, or for so much of him as can be known to those who never saw him in the flesh, in what his friends have to tell us of him and in what he tells us of himself in his letters to them. He was a great letter writer, and gave his friends of his best; and the two volumes of his letters which have been edited by one of his friends, Mr. Sidney T. Irwin, with a charming "" Introductory Memoir ” (Constable) will be appreciated by all lovers of good
literature. Still, even in his letters, which are
undoubtedly of high quality, we do not see all that his friends evidently saw in him. We do not recognize in them the man of whom the Bishop of Hereford writes :—
To compare Brown with the average run of even the
^b°T^LaU
onrS 7k SVtiS
familiar northern scenes; but we miss the pent-up forces, the volcanic outbursts, the tropic glow, and all the surprisingly manifold and tender and sweet-scented outpourings of soil and sunshine, so spontaneous, so inexhaustibly rich, and with the great heat of fire burning
and palpitating all the time.
Such an appreciation surely points to a much larger and richer nature than shows I itself in these letters. They are good letters, I as we have said, spontaneous, sympathetic, I varied, kindly, humorous, and full of a fine sense of literature. They are also sui generis. Ig were neither fair nor criti-1 eally just to compare them favourably or un- I favourably with the famous letters of more famous men. They must be judged on their own merits; I and so judged they will be rated high. But they will not be rated with the highest. There must have been some subtle bond of spiritual and intellectual sympathy between Mr. Brown and his friends which made the latter see more in his words and thoughts than the world at large is ever likely to find. Much is said by his friends
of his wide literary knowledge, his large literary
sympathies, his exquisite critical faculty. We are ready to take all this for granted, but we do not find quite so much of it as we should expect in I the letters .We hardly know whether his extreme, not to say extravagant, admiration for the work of his fellow-islander, Mr. Hall Caine, is to I be set to the credit of his critical faculty, or of his island patriotism, but as criticism it is perhaps a little out of the centre. He is happier in an apoph-1 thegm like the following :—“ There are nice Rabelaisians, and there are nasty Rabelais-1
ians, but the latter are not Rabelaisians.” But, on the whole, the letters will I be judged and. appreciated, not for their I literary or critical merits, but as the intimate, I albeit imperfect, record of a temperament and I personality which displayed to all who knew the writer some of the rarest attributes of genius, If the genius is not so , conspicuous to the stranger as it was to the friend, there is no more I to be said. But manifestly the personality was I rare and the temperament engaging. |
In a volume published by Messrs. Macmillan wo have Mr. Brown's collected verses. Most of them are stories of rural and seafaring existence among the Manx, and couched in the local dialect, partly Celtic survival (biddiuzg—"" cream I ready for churning ”), partly commonplace (ger tatt “ get out,” or glioses “ghosts ”). Addressing the problematical future poet of the island, Mr. Brown said :
• -
Thenative a^nt'pie.mcholed
With Cockney balderdash. Old Manx is waning.
Again—
With Keltic force, with Keltic fire,
With Keltic tears let every string be burning. No doubt this was Mr. Brown's poetic ideal. I He is “ soaked in local dialect,” but very little of it is 11 old Manx ” ; which we humbly ] take to be a dialect of Gaelic. "" Hould this hoss,’ for instance, may be old Manx, but may more probably be regarded, as a blend, of IrishEnglish and of American. Potatoes ætepriddhas, which has a Gaelic look ; sthrooghing, for _ stroking, resembles the Irish brogue. 11 These I dialee’s is terrible,” says one of Mr. Brown’s heroes, and a note adds, "" people toiZl talk in I dialects.” They will, and will write in them too,and 1 the Manx dialect appears, on the whole,to resemble English in an Irish mouth, with a few Gaelic words, and possibly, though. we have not observed it, a dash of Scandinavian. ""While this I is the form of speech, Mr, Brown’s matter and manners are somewhat akin to those of the usual English literary writers in dialect; the vein of sentiment is even rather Scotch (though. I not so much so as that of Ian Maclaren), Mr. Brown, being of Scotch Border descent. The narrators of his very long versified narratives are Manxmen, usually, and have large excellent hearts, and often employ picturesque ex-1 pressions. In “ Mary Quayle ” we have a very old motif—that of “ Adam Bede.” The sweet-
heart of the Manx wooer has a child to an under-1
graduate. The wooer induces him to promise to come to marry her, but the young Oxford man I
is drowned., the day before he sets out, while playing a salmon. He was found, dead, but clinging to his rod. “ like the good, one that he I was,” to quote Bon Gaultier. How a river full of Crags and precipices appeared in a land of I “ meadows like long lakes of grass,” the geologist may inquire, but perhaps the stream had cut a I kind Of canon, as in the Cumberland Eden. At all events, the idea of the tale is rather well worn (except the part about the salmon, though Lap. nlwAOi-lv n nnan non in finhiAnl n<n/4 -Al, n. 1
that has already appeared in fiction), and the
merit lies in the descriptions of Manx character and landscape.
The fault of Mr. Brown is copiousness. He has not a curiosa felicitas, but almost an incuriosa facilitas. The poems occupy 736' pages of close type. We have enormous abundance of verse like this :—
No, no !
Only to go,
To flow,
To fling my spray in the sunny glow,
To splash. To dash, Heels over head with a crazy crash,
Again,
Did you put it in the papers?
No, no ! What capers !
No, no!
Splendid though !
“ What capers,” indeed ! “ Sir,” said
Johnson,"" a man might write such stuff for ever if he would abandon his mind to it.” Endless screeds
Dr.
of such irregular fluency become extremely tedious. The poem of “ Old John,” though lengthy, has form and biographical interest; and there is a pretty piece of rural vers de societe, styled “ An Oxford Idyll.” The passion for nature is, throughout, sincere, and among the lyrics is a charming piece, “ I bended unto me.” Probably Mr. Brown would have had more readers
is a discreet editor had selected- his hest ahd
Tmeses! pieces, with the choice of his tales os rural -sentiment and sorrows in the Manx dialect, though many of these would have been quite as welcome in prose as in a. scamper of runaway rhymes. Mr. Brown, in short, wish many poetical qualities, was not -a poet ; his verse is far too facile, and far too formless ; it is not distilled like drops of-amber/but pours down like the rain from rocky heights, an a turbid, hurrying spate of uncouth words. The narrators, to be sure, are naturally garrulous men, and to make them extremely prolix may be dramatically correct. But it results in a volume of 736 mortal pages ; very few of them marked by distinction. This is the more strange as Mr. Brown was intimately familiar with classical literature. As occasionally happens, he chose models and a style utterly unlike what he most admired in literature. It is as if Tennyson had given us many hundreds of pages in the manner of the "" Lincolnshire Farmer,” which would have been most “ tolerable and not to be endured.”",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS218425182/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=f183590e

Mr. Edmond Holmes, the author of a little volume of poems which made a decided mark, has

And again,if these indicate what the poet is in himself, another set of principles may be discovered, if we examine how he should communicate himself to others; that is, expression also has its 1 _» „ _

On the other hand, Mr. Arthur Symons in his volume The Symbolist Moe

The average educated, man, the average man of tetters will probably reply that “that way commonly mean by “ the accidents of daily life I includes the general sum of human experience, the normal emotions, affections, joys, sorrows ; the things with which Homer dealt, and Sophocles and WoTdsworth ; while what these writers would | , .., . .

I substitute for them are for the most part inchI vidual fancies, often morbid fancies, of vheir own. which cannot be thoroughly tasted cxceoti
by morbid minds. Still poets like Verlaine,
MaJlarmd, and the rest have attained to a certain importance, durable or not, and a book which gives a trustworthy account of them,written with Mr. Symons’s ability, is sure of a welcome.
The writer has simultaneously published a volume of verse of his own, Images of Good and Evil (Heinemann), and this naturally partakes of the qualities which he admires in other poets. In prose he aims at being, so to speak, the successor
of Walter Pater ; in verse he “ throws back ” in part to the Symbolist French writers, and in part to the early-middle period of Mr. Swinburne. ""Wo confess that we should like the poetry better if “ dreams ”—the word and the thing—pervaded, the pages less, and if there were not quite such a banishing of the large emotions of life. Quito the best of the poems are those written in Spain, whether or not they have anything Spanish in them ; the two called “ At Tarragona”and “ At Toledo ” have a genuine mystic note, and that called “ Spain,” addressed to a Spanish dancer who lightly sings of the ruin of her country, touches reality in a very different way from many of the poems which aim at a more obscure truth, and do not always hit it.
With Mr. Symons’s volume we naturally group that called Decorations (Smithers), the posthumous publication of the unfortunate Ernest Dowson, in whose memory Mr. Symons writes some interesting pages in the current Fortnightly Review. Dowson died the other day, aged 32, worn out with drink and ill-success ; a pathetic figure from every point of view, who became tragic in his end. He was a genuine poet ; in reading his work and the story of his life one can but repeat the futile wish that fate and his temperament had been kinder to him, and that he might have had a better chance of making his gifts prevail.
The fire is out, and spent the dregs thereof. (This is the end of every song man sings 1) Tho golden wine is drmik ; tho dregs remain. Bitter as wormwood, and as salt as pain ;
And health aud hope have gone the way of love Into the drear oblivion of lost things.
So sang poor Dowson towards the end of his life, and we now know that he spoke from experience. His ghost may have the feeble satisfaction of knowing that now that he is dead his thin and not too wholesome muse will be cherished by the little band of English readers who value all poetry that is sincere and musical, whether the message which the poet has to give be sweet or bitter.
Professor J. K. Ingram, of Dublin, the author of Sonnets and Other Poems (A. and C. Black), is perhaps not a poet, but he is a man who has felt deeply, and writes with clearness and force. It is interesting to find him avowing and reprinting the famous rebel song, “ Who fears to speak of Ninety-Eight ?” which he wrote some fifty years ago, though in the preface he is careful to say that he “ now no longer sympathizes with those who preach sedition in our own day, when all the circumstances are radically altered.” The professor is a thoroughgoing Positivist, and he makes the religion of humanity and the fame of “ the Master ” (Auguste Comte) the subject of a good deal of harmonious verse. We can read it with interest, but are no more convinced by it than by the admiring sonnet “ To the President of the Transvaal ”—for Mr. Ingram is what is known as a pro-Boer. By far the best of the poems are those which describe with much sincerity and pathos the writer’s own sorrow in the death of his wife.
Another volume ot Irish verse, which has the genuine note of poetry, is Miss “ Moira O’Neill’s ” Songs oe the Glens of Antrim
(Blackwood), a little volume of CO pages which deserves a permanent place in any collection of Irish poetry. It is not generally known that in the midst of the non-Gel tie county of J Antrim are some “ glens ” inhabited by Irish as thoroughbred as though they come from Mayo, |
and the writer, who describes herself as “ a
glenswoman,” catches up the poetry of these people and throws it into verse, now light, now pathetic, of a really charming kind.
We have already briefly noticed the adaptations of Lucretius which Mr. W. H. Malloek lately published in the Anglo-Saxon Review. These
experiments in the metre of FitzGerald’s “ Omar
Khayyam ” have now been reprinted in a small volume under the title Lucretius on Life and , Death (A. and C. Black), and in their per-! manent form the verses will be read with ‘
interest. Translations they are not; they are a much-expanded paraphrase of some of the most' striking and most genuinely poetical passages of the great Epicurean poet. Mr. Malloek, who has '< written so much in praise of the Roman Catholic ’ position, does not shrink from presenting the "" extreme, and, as he would say, the only philosophical alternative. This has never been put so forcibly in English verse as it is in these powerful stanzas.
Amid reprints we have to notice the volume containing the Complete Poems of Mathilde Blind (Unwin), which is edited by Mr. Arthur Symons, with an interesting memoir by Dr. Richard Garnett; and the volume called First and Last Poems, by Arabella Shore (Grant Richards). In the latter case it is only a portion of the poems that are reprinted ; some of them

might perhaps have been a poet had she ever
attained a complete mastery of English ; but, as was natural in one of purely German birth
who lived for the most part among Germans in her youth, she never learnt to use our speech with perfect freedom. Nor was she always alive to the difference between rhetoric and poetry. She grasped the Darwinian hypothesis, in its application to human life, with fair success, and her poem on “ The Ascent of Man ” is a vigorous presentation of it. But it is singularly rhetorical in form, though probably the writer, with her strong sense of the manifold injustices that hang on the skirts of progress, wrote it in all sincerit.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS151840457/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=1b424721

Mr. Murray’s new edition of Bykon has now reached the third volume of the poetry, which includes, with many minor poems,“ The Corsair ” and other Eastern tales, “The Hebrew Melodies,"" “ The Siege of Corinth,” &c. Mr. Ernest Coleridge, the editor, has noted with the greatest care all variations of the text, and has added illustrative notes in sufficient abundance. This
volume, in fact, like those which have preceded it both in prose and verse, seems to show that no future edition of Byron need over be attempted. Commentators will have nothing to do but to quarry in tho materials which Mr. Coleridge and Mr. Murray have provided for them. This is nob the moment to discuss tho impression made upon a modern reader who turns to these poems either for the first time or, as will be the case with
most of us, after an interval of many years ; enough to say that they present a curious mixture of tho hopelessly antiquated and of the permanent. Perhaps never again, certainly not in our time, will the world take pleasure in anything so rhetorical, so obvious, so elementary as, for example, “ The Corsair,"" which, as wo are here reminded, was devoured with passionate eagerness by the public when it appeared, in the beginning of 1814. “ I sold on tho day of publication—a thing perfectly unprecedented—10,000 copies,” wrote ""Murray to tho author ; and all
—,—, - the world went mad about Conrad aud Medora
<NEWPAGE>
and Gulnare. A few splendid passages, a few immortal couplets remain to give us pleasure
now ; the rest scarcely counts in. comparison with “ Childe Harold ” and “ Don Juan,” the poems ■which reveal the real Byron. It may be added that the volume contains the several small poems which show what a wretched creature that real Byron sometimes proved to be. “ The Sketch,” here printed in “ Poems of the Separation,” was not too severely described by ""Wordsworth as “theBillingsgate of Bedlam,” and. was denounced in The Times when the verses were first published as “ low malignity and miserable doggerel.” But it need hardly be said that a volume which contains such verses as “ She walks in beauty ” and “ ""When we two parted,” and a hundred other well-remembered things, is not to be condemned ""because ""* The Sketch ” is ignoble and “ The Corsair ” not much more than a declamatory exercise.
In I Believe (Religious Tract Society) the Bishop of Calcutta, Dr. Welldon, endeavours to set forward the nature and reasonableness of the Christian creed “ in such language as the young could easily understand.” If by “ the young ’ he means sixth form boys or other young persons old enough to be exercised by spiritual difficulties among whom, intellectually, may be classed the intelligent artisans,the book is well adapted for its purpose. But its author by no means confines himself to tho ‘1 very simple words ’ ’ which in his preface he states that he has found it necessary to make use of in teaching Christian doctrine to the young. Such sentences as this, “ The first, question of religion is clearly this—How did the Universe—i.e., the sum total of phenomena—come into being?” or, “Tho realization of God’s Universal Presence is a powerful incentive to virtuous and godly living ” demand more than a child’s intelligence; and the fact that Dr AVelldon cannot reduce his exposition of the creed to simpler terms shows the weakness of the contention, sometimes put forward,that abstract dogmatic theology can be taught to much purpose to very young children. As Dr. ""Welldon truly says, the technical terms of theology “ have no meaning for them, and simply pass over their heads.” For older boys or intelligent working men this commonsense, manly statement of the truths of the Christian creed as worthy of belief—understanding by belief not a claim to certain knowledge, but assent to reasonable probabilities—may be
commended as helpful.
Religious disputes, as we know to our cost, turn largely upon things unessential, and the first requisite for a rightly-balanced view is to distinguish, in doctrine and practice, between what is really essential and what is impressive perhaps, but of subordinate importance. This Canon F. J. Holland, of Canterbury, essays to do in a modest little volume entitled Essentials in Religion (Arnold), of which we can at least say 0 si sic omnes ecclesiastici I It comprises six sermons delivered in Canterbury Cathedral, under the headings Essentials and Non-Essentials ; Essentials in the Divine Faith, the Divine Law, the Divine Sacraments, Church Organization, and Church Ritual. In the first, which is introductory, Canon Holland illustrates the distinction from St. Stephen’s speech at Jerusalem, which sets forth God’s covenant with his people as essential, but the Temple and the Law as nonessential now that their purpose was fulfilled. In the next three the doctrines of the Apostles’ Creed, the rule of the Ten Commandments understood in the spirit and not in the letter only, “Regeneration,” or the new birth in Baptism, and the memorial sacrifice and Holy Communion in the Eucharist, are laid down as essentials. In the last two sermons the preacher does what many disputants on Church questions are unwilling to do. He goes back to the New Testament, and finding how little is there said about either organization or ritual, he concludes, as most impartial minds do, thai
Church organization and Church ritual, however important and helpful, are not essential to the true idea of the “ Holy Catholic Church.” The term ” Church,” as he truly points out, is confusedly used sometimes in its lower sense of ecclesiastical order, sometimes in the higher and truer sense of spiritual union in the Body of Christ ; and he effectively illustrates the difference by the “ dismal alteration of sublime descriptions of God’s Church” in Holy Scripture, if for the word “ Church ” be substituted “ecclesiastical organization, ’ ’ On the question of incense he has some sound and practical remarks ; and his attitude towards this and similar questions is thus summed up—“Be ritual what it may, no ritual is absolutely essential ; and be ritual however gorgeous, all ritual will tend to become more and more simple unto its final extinction in the perfected Church.” We can only repeat, O si sic omnes!
An interesting study of the representative system in Japan has been published in Brussels
in the shape of an exhaustive essay, SystiIme Repr^sentatif au Japon (Lamertin, Bruxelles), prepared for the Brussels Free University by M. Hisatsuna Furuya, Doctor of Political Science. The first chapter deals with the causes and methods which secured so rapid and successful a transformation of Japanese institutions under
the pressure of Western ideas. The second and third chapters set forth in detail the composition j of the Japanese Diet and its procedure, and the 1
fourth and last chapter is devoted to a critical I examination of the working of the representative system as now established and of the further reforms which in the author’s opinion are still requisite for its final development. Political students will certainly feel grateful to M. Furuya for having furnished them with so useful a handbook on a most interesting subject of modern constitutional history.

Mr. Frederic Harrison’s volume, called Tennyson, Ruskin, Mm, and other Literary Esti mates, is in some sense a sequel to his volume on “Early ""Victorian Literature,” published five years ago. That, however, kept itself almost exclusively to the novelists and historians, and the reader found himself taking up a volume on
literature from which poetry and philosophy were expressly excluded. Here on the other hand, we have, as far as the bulk of the essays are concerned, a series of "" estimates of some of the leading influences on the thought of our time,” together with a few articles of a more retrospective kind, especially two very: excellent ones on the new memoirs and letters of Gibbon. It is hard to say anything fresh about those “ leading influences ” ; has
not everything been said a hundred times over about Tennyson and his poetry, Mill and his Individualist philosophy, and (just now especially) about Ruskin, the critic and the social reformer ? Perhaps it has, but yet Mr. Harrison’s essays on these subjects, as on others, are worth reading, for nobody denies either the width of his cultivation or the independence—so far as Positivism allows him to be independent—of his mind. In the essays on Tennyson and Ruskin we find him breaking what is for him new ground in his very elaborate criticism of their workmanship as writers of verse and prose. On Ruskin’s prose he is very good indeed ; on Tennyson’s verse he carries nis criticism to fantastic lengths. And in judging the matter of Tennyson’s poetry he is certainly not more convincing. Mr. Harrison condemns the poet for his halfbeliefs, his "" honest doubt,” and his disposition to “ faintly trust the larger hope ” ; and yet when he comes upon something that Tennyson really did believe in, the something which its enemies call Imperialism and its friends the world-mission of England, he promptly denounces him as a Jingo and a journalist. ""What is this but to condemn the poet because he and bis critic do not believe in the same things ? Ae to the other essays, we cannot but keel the critic overrates the late J. A.

'LAAs WisZETr QUA3Ms (Mamilan).
Mr. Alfred Austin has returned to the kind of composition which he made so popular in "" The Garden that I Love,"" and in a volume of prose narrative interspersed with lyrics has pictured the winter and spring spent by a little English group on the Riviera, and in a villa near Florence. That country is so delightful in itself and in its wvealth of association, that even a much less practised pen thhan Air. Austin's could make such a book attractive. Any one with an eye for the country and the people, and with somo knowledge of history, could produce a pleasant volume about them ; a skillel writer vith a genuine love for fiowers,blue skies, and cont adini, and some knowledge of art, was certain to write what would command the interest of many readers. WVhat we have said only concerns Mr. Austin's prose, biit tho songs and short soliloquies in verse which he puts into the mouth of "" the poet "" are quite as important. "" The poet,"" let it be said, is one of the four characters of the story, the others being Veronica-clever housewife, good botanist, and competernt historian-Lamia, the fascinating young girl for whose pleasure the wholo tour seema to have been devised, and the ' I "" of the book, who professes to wvrite theaccountofit. To say that there is any system in the book would not be true. It is not a story, nor an essay, nor a guide-book, nor a poem, but it has something of all four. The conversations lack dramatic truth, and any one who tries to read them aloud will see that they do not really represent talk. Here are two examples:-
Suddenly other persiana were pushed back, sand Veronica joined us.
'What are you all doing9 ""
Do you remember,"" anwered Lamia, "" the vifo of Cosimo, Pater Patrin, asking him, when advanced in years, why be so often sate with closed eyes, and his answering that he did so in order tu accustom tiem to what thev must soon always be doing' I nm opening mine thus early, feeling that, in such a world as this, I shall never be able to close them again.
That is not how charming young women talk, whether in Italy or elsewhere ; and in like manner we may demur to the followving:-
"" Some of these are very successful,"" I ventured to observe.
"" Not,"" said Veronica, "" if in the notion of success be included that of succession. Congratulated to-day, wvvl they not be consigned to oblivion to-morrow, when right taste has resumed its authority, or when some one yet more extravagant creates an impression, equally sudden and equally transitory, of a somewhat similar character i' ""
But the passages of description are excellent, especially such a one as this, suggested by the first appearance of the fireflies
"" A firefly ! A firefly ! ""
It was Veronica, invariably the most observant of us, whoso voice called to us to welcome tho fairy visitor, whose arrival is as deli""htful aud mnmcintous au event in Italy as the wving of The first snallow, the call of the first cuckoo, or the note of the first nightingale in England. WVe were all on the alert in a moment, calling in return
"" V'here ? UL'here ? ""
It was a single, solitary firefly, for one may say of fireflies as of primroses:-
First you come by ones and ones, Lastly in battalions,
and it moved and twinkled in the deepening twilight, among the olive trees, a miniature and terrestrial plant, haviDg no fixed orbit. I need seareely say that this was some days before Pasqua delle Rose. though WVhitsuntide happened to be an early one, and the following night we saw three, and the night after seven. 'Then-for May can be capricious in Tuscany as elsewhere-the weather was not propitious for them. But by the time the moon was nearly at full they were plenteous as stars in the MIilky Way, and while they fltted sand glistened among the darkening leaves the nightingales rejoiced and enlivened each other with the song that an ancient story and inherited association have transformed for us into a strrin of imaginary sadaess. Life offers no more enchanting combination of sensations than fall to one's lot on a warm Italian night in Mlay, when moonlight, fireflies, and nightingales weavo their concerted charm; and night after night we repaired to the same antique marble seat, where we liked to think Lorenzo and his associates had often sat, in front of the same dark silent cypresses, and drank in the same sweet, grave, harmonious delights.
Good,too,are some of the historical reminiscences, touched with the lightness of hand wvhich -Mr. Austin sometimes forgets in his conversations. And many of tho lyrics have great charm , note especially the dialogue betwveen the Mountains and the Sea, and the "" Good Night"" Which well deserves quotation:-
Good-night ' Now dwindle wan and low The embers of the afterglow,
And slowly over leaf and lawn
Is twilight's dewy curtain drawn.
The slouching vixen leaves her lair,
And, prowling, sniffs the tell-tale air. The frogs croak louder in the dyke, And all the trees seem dark alike: The bee is drowsing in tBe comb,
The sharded beetle hath gone home
Good-night !
Good-night ! The hawk is in his nest, And the last rook hath dropped to rest. There is no bum, no chirp, no bleat, No rustle in the meadow-sweet.
'Thc woodbine, somewhere out of sight, Sweetens the loneliness of night.
The Sister Stars, that once were seven,
Ilourn for their missing mate in Heasen. The poppy's fair frail lpetals close, The lily yet more languid grows,
And dewy-dreamy droops the rose
Good-night !
'We notice, hownver, some mannerisms that appear to be growing upon the writer, especially a trick of turning substantives into adjectives or participles, as where in the former of these two poems the mountains are described as ""nimbused by sunlight.""

Mr. E. V. Lucas, who modestly calls himself the "" editor "" of this little volume, has met wvith a piece of good fortune suclh as seldom falls to the lot of a literary man. In 18(94 there were discovered ""two masses of correspondence relating to the family of Charles Lloyd (17I8-1828), the Quaker philanthropist and barker of Birmingham."" Among these papers woro found lotters from S. T. C oleridge, Wordswortli, Southey, and many of their iriends, and, above all, more than 20 new letters of Charles Lamb, "" some of them worthy to rank with his best."" This mass of correspondence was put into the hands of Mr. Lucas, w'ho has had the pleasant task of building Up, upon that foundation, what he rightly calls the "" story of a notable family."" All students of Coleridge and his circle know something about Charles Lloyd the younger, who went for a time as pupil or "" paying guest "" to Coleridge in Somersetshire, and sonme of whose poems were incorporated with those of Coleridce himself in one of the volumes published by Cottle at Bristol. The recently issued letters of Coleridge and Mr. Dykes Campbell's Life have thrown much light upon this incident, but little has till now been known of Charles Lloyd's family. EHis father,the Birmingham Quaker,was a remarkable man ; his principal function in life, perhaps we may say, was to found Lloyd's Bank, but, as Mr. Lucas ingeniously points out, he had ""a mental vigour and variousness "" which, though of course in a very minor degree, almost anticip ated Mr. Gladstone. He was ""concerned in Iargo schemes of benevolence,"" ho was an authlsonity upon finance, he was intensely religious, and he devoted his leisuro to translatinp7 Homer and Hiorace. Of all this,
and especially of the last phase of the elder Lloyd's history, a full account is given by Mr. Lucas, some of whose chapters contain specimens of the translation of the Iiad into the heroic couplet, with the shrewd criticisms of Lamb and the pompous approbation of the Swan of Liehfield, Anna Seward. But neither here nor in the aecountsgiven of Charles Lloyd the younger does the main interest of the volume consist. W'hat gives it a real claimto attention is the story oftheafriendship between Charles Lamb and youn'Robert Lloyd, Charles's brother, who, oppressea by the stifling atmosphere of his home, and being inclined to the new ideas of Godwin and his circle, "".eloped "" from Birmingham (without a companion, bien entendu) and took refuge with Charles Lamb in London. This was in January, 1799, but we have three letters dated during the preceding autuimn which show that Lamb had rapidly taken the position of adviser and elder friend to the impulsive, serious-minded ,op..One,of these as Mr. Lucas remarks, 'is how_
Charles Lamb in a new and beautiful character,"" the charaoter of an adviser and moderator, for it is nothing less than a letter of good counsel sugeesting to Robert a way out of his spiritual difficulties. The letters of Lamb already published, delightful as they are, contain nothing precisely in this tone, so that it is worth while to quote the conclusion of this letter to Robert Lloyd, premising that the substance of the whole is to urge the lad to depend for happiness rather upon his own character than upon his circumstances or even his friends:-
I do not wish to deter you from ma'king a friend, a true friend, nDd such a friendship, where the artieS are not blind to each other's faults, is very us and valuable. I perceive a tendency in you to this error, Robert. I know you ba've chosen to take up an high opinion of my moral v,orth, but I say it before God, and I do not lie, you are mistak-en ia me. I could not bear to lay open all my failings to you, for the sentiment of saiamu would be too pungent. Let this be as an example to you Robert friends fall off, friends mistalke us, they change, t3cy grow unlike us, they go away, they die ; but God is everlasting and incapable of change, and to Him we may look with cheerful, tnpresumptuous hope, while we discharge the duties of life in situations more nutowardly than yours. You complain of the impossibility of improving yourself, but be assured that the opportunity of improvement lies more in the mind than the situation. Humble yourself before God, cast out the sellish principle, wait in patience, do good in every way you can to all sorts of people, never be easy to neglect a duty, tho' a small one, praise G-od for al, end see His hand in all things, and He wrill in timue raise yoa up many frierds-or be Himself instead an unchanging friend. God bless you.
C. LAMB.
Tho breach between Robert Llopl and his family was soon healed ; w-ork was found for Robert at Birmingham, and for some years afterwards an intermittent correspondence was kept up between him and his friend in London. 3Ir. Lucasblames Robert, with some reason, for maldng this correspondence so scanty, and indeed it is difficult to understand how a young man who had only to write to Lamb to bo sure of extractin' from him a marvellous bit of criticism or playful picture of life should havo been so chary in thei use of his opportunities. But some letters he did extract, and to our good fortune they have now been disinterred, after lying lost for almost a century. It is hard to choose among theso vhether we should quote the eulogy of Isank; Walton, or the passage in praise of London as against the country, or the little rhapsody about Jeremy Taylor, or the letter to Robert congratulating him upon his marriage. All areas perfect as they can hc. Perhaps the followving, "" a piece of the tnle Elia,"" gives the most characteristic picture of Lamb:
Dear llobert,-I shall expect yon to bring mo X brimful acconnt of the pleasure which Walton has given you, when you come to town, It must square with your mind. The delightful innocence and healthfulness of the angler's mind will hava flown upon yours like a zephyr. Don't yon already feel your spirit filled with the scenes ?-the banks of iivers, the cowslip beds, the pastoral scenes, the neat alehouses, and hostesses and =ilkmaids, as far exceeding Virgil and Pope as the "" Holy Living "" is beyond Thomas aKempis. Are not the eating and drinkiing joys painted to 1he life ? Do they not inspire you with an immortal hunger? Are not you ambitious of being made on angler ? What edition have you got ? Is it 11awkins's, with plates of Pisentor, &e. ? That sell3 very dear. I have onlv been able to purchasethe hast edition without the old piates wvhich pleased my childhood: the plates being worn out, end the old edition diflicult land expensive to procure. 'The "" Complete Angler "" is the only treatise written in dialogues that is worth a halfpenny. IlIany elegant dialogues have been written (such as Bishop Berkeley's I I Minute Philosopher ""), but in all of them the interlocutors are merely abstract arguments personify'd; not living dramatic characters, as in Walton, shere everythiag is alive the fishes are absoluc.ly charactered; and birds and animals are as interesting as men aud wvomen.
I perfectly understand the nature of vour solitariness r.t Biram, and wish I could divide myself, "" like a bribed haunch,"" between London and it. But courage
you will soon be emancipated, and (it may be) have a frequenit power of visiting this great place. Let them talk of lakes and mountains and ronmantic dales-all that fantastic stuff give me a ramble by nighbt, in the winter nights in T onden-the lamps lit, the pavements of the motley Strand crowded with to and fro passengers, the shops all brilliant, and stuffed with obliging customers anud obliged tradesmen-give me the old boe1Astvils of London, a walk in the bight piazzas of Covent Garden. I defy a man to be doll in such places-perfc-t 1ahemetan paradises upon earth ! } hav lent ou.t my heart with usury to such scenes from my childhood up, end have cried with fulness of joy at the multitldinous recenes of life in the crowded streets of ever dear London,
Of course, these letters of Lamb are the gems of Mr. Lucas's volume, but all the rest has considerable interest for students of the Coleridgean circle, and tlhough it is hard in these days to admire the elder Lloyd's Bomer, or to tak-e much interest in the illustrious Anna Seward,Mr. Lucas has dealt wvith these good people discreetly and could scarcely have dispensed wvith them.
ECCLESIAISTI'AL HISTOyLY.
Trn; LMriEr.3nAN CLERGOY ASD nr SrLrrEmsTix oF RxaicIOx, by Hcnry Gee (Clarendon Press), is a very thorough piece of w ork. turning the microscope upon a special point of ecclesiastical history-viz., the treatment of the cleroy in the first siS years of Elizabeth's reign. The reaction under Queen Mary, accompuanied by a large number of deprivations, bad considerably altered thb acrsenaeZ of the clergy; and when Elizabetl came to the Throne in 1558 she found a large number of tho ""secular "" clergy-according to Camden, 9,400, a figaure probablby exaggeratod -attached to the esistinp stat,e of the Chlurch. Convocation and the IJmsversitses at once set themselves in opposition to the expected legislation of Elizabeth's first Parliament. The Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity, which formed the legislative basis of the settlement of religion until the second Parliament of 1563, were stoutly opposed by the Bishops, wvho afterwvards with one exceptioni were deprived for refusing to take an oath admitting the supremacy. A Royal visitation of both provinces to administer the oath to the clergy was followed by a permanent ecclesiastical commission sitting at intervals from Noveinber,1559,toJuly,1562; Nrhlti,underincreased fears arising from the religious wars in France and the proceedings of Mary Queen of Scots, a fresh commiission -with increased powers was issued, followved in 1563 by moro severo penal lavws. ldr. C-te shlows, from a careful examination of contemporary documents, that during the period covered by his inquiries (1558-1564) tho penal laws were leniently administered, and that the total number of clergy deprived of parochial or University preferments for nonconformity in those six years cannot have much exceeded two hundred. The estimates of modern Anglican Church historians, ranging from 189 to 400, depend ultimately upon .9trype and Camden, both of whom, Ir. Gee shows, were dependent upon a list given by Nicolas Sanders, a deprived Oxford Professor, in his book, ""De Visibili M:onarchia,""published at Louvain inlfl. This list, however, can be shown to be inaccurate, and the calculations made from it must be abandoned. Mir. Gee has done his work well and thoroughly, with illustrative documents in support of his main conclusions that enable the reader to judge of their soundness.
Of much less originality and historical value, but not without interest for the student of this p l of Church history,is the Rev. F. 0.

Most of these "" Lives "" are mere memoranda about persons mere or less obscure; but somewhat mere space is gen to such names as Parker, Grindal, JewelF, and Whitgift.

T-M SToar OF A MSiLY sI;op's LIrE, by Lady Mary Wood (Longmans), is a very short sketch of the life and character of Bishop Androwes of Winchester, whose name is perhaps best known as author of the "" Devotions."" It consists chiefly of quotations from Ottley's "" Life of Andrewes,"" Dean Church's "" Mlasters in Theolo""y,"" and the memoir in the "" Library of Anglo-?atholic Theology ""; hut it is well put together, and gives the reader, wvithout much trouble to himself, a fair idea of Bishop A ndrewes's character, and of the relations between Church and State at the end of the 16th and beginning of the 17th centuries. As the authoress says, ""'ihis short account of his life may not be without interest . . . . whensomany of thequestions which then agitated men's minds have again come to the front.1""

The book is thus a popular reprod7otion rather than an exact quotation of the original; but some of the most characteristic p%ssagec-e.g., the vivid account of Knox's interviews with Queen Mlary-are retained in full, and give a sufficient idea of thestrangelyforciblecharacterof thisrecord by an earnest, gifted, outspokeu zealot of events qo'Tuw mpars magna fuit, dashed off at white heat in the temper of the pulpit rather than of the study-yet, despite its many peculiarities, a remarlkable specimen of clear, nervous English, if not of impartial history.
Dr. Edwvin A. Abbott's researches into the accounts of the death and miracles of ST. Tno3xas OF CA rusu.uY (Black) were,he tolls usiincidentaI to the preparation of a critical commentary on the Four Gospels the object being "" to consider other instances of documents relating the same fact in different language, as the Gospels relate in different language the acts and -words of Christ."" Tho rdpepyovohas grown under his hands into two goodly volumes, containing, first, an exhaustive comparison of eleven Latin narratives of

From these investigations Dr. Abbott deduces canons of historical criticism which be considers applicable to the study of "" synoptic "" documents in general, and the Cospels in particular. The parallels which he points out between the Becket documents and the Gospels are in many respects striking; and with his general conclusions upon the prinuiples to be observed in ascertaining historical trath from -various and sometimes coilicting lines of evidence we may agree. But he hardly takes oufficient accountof the difference, as literature, betweenthe Gospelnarrativesandthe medievalmonkishchronicles that record the beliefs of a yet more credulous age. The -ccretions of legend orthefalsificationso7 error, though not excluded, are surely much less probable in the case of literary histories compiled (as the p reface to St. Luke's Gospel showfs) in a more or less historical spirit than in chronicles SUC11 as those which Dr. Abbott examines wvith such discriminating patience. With this reserve, ve accept his inquiries as having some bearing upon :New Testament criticism, and as in themselves a scholarlike attempt to sifIt -rains of vheat from a heap of chaff. But even with the qualification thLat St. Thomas's miracles were chiefly due to strong emotional excitement in persons affected by them, we shoulld hardly go as far as Dr. Abbott in accepting them as historical. In this, his book is a mi-xture of credulity and scepticism.

Andrer' Lan- Mr. Austin Dobson, Mr. Herbert Panl, Tord Crewe, M1r. Edmund Gosse, `Vemon Lee,"" and ""JohnOliverHobbes,"" it is natural that there should be much in it that is fresh, personal, and interesting. Sometimes we have a definite addition to knowledge, as where Lord Creve gives us a more eoact account than has ever been printed of the famous or nc.torious leaf of the album at the inn att Tlontanvert, whereon Sbelley, travelling in company with Mary Godlwin and Claire Clairmont, proclaims, in doubtful Greek, his atheism. The leaf itself came into Lord Houghton's possession, and is inserted, with all its very curious entries and erasures, in a copy of Shelley's "" Revolt of Islam,"" in Lord Crewe's library. Mdore often the writers discuss questions in which they feel a special interest, or on which they possess special information. liaturally enough, M1r. Austin Dobson takes us througth a novel written almost a century aro hrb one E:. 13arrett, mentioned by hiiss Ansten, hut probably now unknown to everybody but the writer; Mr. Herbert Paul tries very successfullyto revive our admiration for Person, trae critic and true wit; and Mr. Leslie Stephen, triting on ""perishable books,"" points out hows desirable it wvould be that nine out of ten books now produced should be printed on such paper as would automatically ensiire their rapid extinction.
The latest of Mr. Grant Allen's historical guides, which deals witlh VmuicE (Grant Richards), has the mnerits and the faults of the others. That is to say, its root-idea is good and original, wvhile the execution is unequal, being hi places excellent and in others leaving much to be desired. As we remarked in noticing the earlier volumes, it is a great thing for the ignorant but fairly intelligent visitor (male or female) to be takcen in hand on his arrival at a city rich in history, like Venice or Florence, by a guide for whom history is a living thing, and wvho instinctively views individual objects-a palace, a piazza, a church-in its relation to the life of the place as a whole. This Mir. Grant Allen does, and the general resut of his teaching must be to stimulate the. traveller who walks or floats through Venice ;ith this guide-book in his hand. For instance, none of the accepted guidebooks brings out wvith any clearness the relation of certain great churches in Venice, and of a whole class of pictures, to the plague epidemics vwhich often swept through the city ; MIr. Allen devotes a chapter to this subject, to the churches of the Salute, San Rlocco, San Giobbe, and San Sebastiano, and to tle numberless pictures of the two grent plague saints-St. Sebastian and St. Roch. In the Esme w.ay ho treats the Friars' churches together and explains many of the differences betwieen them, and muany of the features of the wsorks of art whichl they contain, by simple historical reasons. At the same time some of Mr. Allen's history, and a good deal of his art criticism, area little hasty; and vwe cannot understand v;hy he dissuades the traveller from visiting the Madonna del Orto, wrhich contains two of the most wonderful Tintorets in the world, and the 3Museo Correr, where there are various first-rate pictures and an extraordinary collection of 18th-century costumes.

We remarked, in reviewing the first volume of the new edition of Byron a month ago, that it is under the charge of two editors and is being brought out in two parallel series, Mr. Ernest Coleridge taking in hand the poetry and Mr. R. E. Prothero the prose. It is the first volume of the latter which now makes its appearance; the I.snr- AND JoUr-NALs, extending from 1798, when the lad was ten years old, down to 1811. It will be remembered that this is not tho first important new edition of Byron which has recently been projected and begun. 'More than a year ago another publisher, Mr. Heinemann, began to issue an edition, directed by Mr. W. E. Henley, and the first volume of this, which is all that has at present appeared, contained letters down to 1813, with a series of learned and elaborate biographical notes. Unfortunately this edition was not and cannot be complete. for it was not issued by arrangement with Mr. Murray, the successor of Byron's original publisher, who stil retains certain copyrights,and who,inaddition,possesses many unpublishedByron manuscripts. Nor had Lord Lovelace, Byron's grandson, been a consenting party to the Ifenley edition, so that nobody was surprised wheni, about the time of the publication of that volume, it was announced that the new unauthorized issue would be promptlv met by an autborized one, put out by the old house with all their available strength of new raterial. In reeard to the first volumae of the poems, we have 2ad, of course, no opportunity of comparing it with Mbr. Elenley's work, but it is different with the prose. The volume before as, in fact, comes in1tO direct competition wvith the volumo issued by Mr. HIeinemaun in 1897. The new editor expresses his regret that the work could not have been done by Mr. Henley, to whose abilities he pays a cordial tribute ; but as the fates have decided otherwise there was nothing left for him but to proceed. His first volume, down to August 22, 1811, "" prints 168 letters, or an addition of 107 to Moore, 90 to Halleck, and SO to Mr. Henley."" We have gone through the list, and find that these 80 consist mainly of family letters (to the poet's half-sister especially), to John Hanson, his lawyer, and other persons very close to him, while one long and interesting letter to Mr. Murray is given, though it was written ia 1820, and is, therefore, a little out of its place. It will remain to be seen wvhether the modern world. which has so ianch to read, will interest itself in these slight records of the boyhood and growth of a great man. Certainlv the editor is right in saying tba.t the letters "" give the truest portrait of the man,"" and that "" they possess at their best, in their ease, freshness, and racy vigour, a very high literary value."" The first and third qualities will appear more fully in the later letters, as we see by comparing the ease and fluency of the 1820 letter (abourt the character of his deceased friend, C. S. Mlatthews) .with the stiffness of the early writings. It is scarcely necessary to say that the picture of Byron's home in his boyhood is not by any means attractive. His father, who died when the boy was three years old, -was
a gambler, a spendthrift, a profliate scamp "": his mother, though she bore her 'ard lot with fortitude, and w-as "" in her own vay a devoted mother,"" was of an ungovernable temper and her son found her impossible. Such a home training was a fit preface to Byron's own matrimonial career: but to that, of course, we are not introduced in this first volume.
A NonTsnxn HIGHWAY VP THI TsAR (Con-
stable).
This narrative of Mr. Aubyn Trevor-lBattyes journey across Arctic Russia is ajaequel to his wellknown 'Icebound on Kolguev.' )V hen, on leaving Kolguev, Mr. Trevor-Battye was landed on the inhospitable shores of the Kolokolgova Gulf, he desired to make his way home as rapidly as possible. The autumn was just beginning, and at that particular season travelling in that region is almost entirely suspended for reasonsvwhich the author sets forth as follows:-
There are five seasons in the year in Northern Russia -our four, and a fifth, Rasputnya by name. Ilsaputnya means literaly *l the parting of the Wvays,"" ard is used for a period between autumn and winter. Travelling by one of the high northern trails is easy enough in summer when the ground is drv and firm, is delightful in winter when the sleighs glide over the snow. sad ,over the ice of lake or river; but in Rasputnya it is not easv, it is very difficult, and no one dreams of moving then. It is freezing one day and thawiag the -next, the ice-charged rivers are dangerous for boats, and all the land is morass and swamp. Daring the _whole of October the Government postal service is stopped, labour contracts are off, and the keepers of the stages are entirely freed from their usual obligation to supply the traveller with horses or slcigbs. This explains why. when an inqmry es to mv whereabouts was made from England, the inevitable answer -came that no news could arrive IItill the swamps were irozen up."" Certainly no Russian could imagine any peraonrashenough to tr and travel then. But an Eugliishmn is proverbially obstinate; and meantime through these swamps I was pushing on inch by inch by vanous shifts and devices. It is of these that the story tils.
In other words, the interest of Mfr. Trevor*Battye's narrative rests, as he acknowledges him-elf, "" on Pasputnya, and on Rasputnya alone."" It rests, however, on a sufBciently finn foundation. It is not likely that the narrative of Mr. Trevor-Battye's experiences will tempt other travellers to follow in his tracks; a journey tduring the seasou of Rasputnya across the ""; tundras "" and through the forests of Northern Russia will never be undertaken by chcice, and can seldom be undertaken through necessity, as it was in Mr. Trevor-Battye's case-for he was pledged to his companion to be back in England lbvCristmas, and determined to fulfil his pledge, vihich he did. Such - journey may therefore be regarded as quite exceptional and almost unique, and on that account alone it is rell worthy of permanent record. Though Mfr. Trevor-Battye tells his story with a light heart and unflagging spirit, it is an unbrolken vecord of hardship, difficulty, exposure, privation, discomfort, and incessant peril, from the time he left the Kolokolgova Gulf until he finally reached A&rchangel-and even there, as the following story shows, his periis were not at an end:
My friend MIr. Wilten (the only other Englishman in Arehaagel), who had ebarge of a sw-mill on an island at some distance from the shore, had asked me to dine with him, saying that the ico was safe enough if I kept to a certain track, which any guida could, point out to me, or 1 could follow for myself, as it was marked by heaps of noaw. But that evening it began to snow agam, and the night was exceedingly dark. I took a droski down to the water's edge, but the man would come no further, as the ice would not bear a horse and sleigh. There was not a soul about, so I was obliged to make the crossing by myself. I could see the lights of Wilton's island tinkg far away, as I committed myself, not without some misgivings, to the chances of this passage. The ice was usually tirm enough, but sometimes it seemed to bend, and it creaked in an omious was, and when I was half-wary across I began to wishi 1 hd not started. It 'was so dark that I could not see the heaps of snow, only every now and then I stumbled against one. Very lowly I crept along, expecting every moment to be dropped into a water hole and delivered to the sturgeon of the Dvina. Meantime Wilton was uncorking iis liquors in his wa=m diningroom, blissfully umeonscious of his expected guest's position. Eventnualy, when I was about two-thirds ,over, I saw a light moving on the shore of the island, and hollosed out to ask if I was right. "" No."" c mme back L voice in Russian, "" you are off the track altogether; mind, there's water there ! Now come straight to this light ! "" Doing as I was bid, I arrived safely. But my cautious progress had turned a ten .gainutes' crosing into one of nearly half an hour.
This story is characteristic, for the chief dangers ,and difficulties encountered by Mr. Trevor-Battye 'were those involved in the frequent passage of ionly partidly frozen rivers, and he seems to have d many narrow escapes and to have extricated :himself from many an almost desperate situation by sheer pluck and resource. The narrative of this dreary journey is monotonous in the .sense that the same difficulties constantly recurred and were as constantly surmounted; 'but, though the story is simply and moderately told, it bears abundant testimony to the fortitude, endurance, and cheery stoicism of the tri-vellers who traversed these desolate and forbidding wastes, as well as to the gocd temper and goaul will of those who helped them on their way. 'The book is dedicated by special permission to the present Tsar, and concludes with a warm -expression of admiration for his character.
- EssAys ox SECOYDAnY EDUCAMOoI (Clarendon
Press).
This book is in some respects disappointing.
lt is written by contribnTora of _practical exs.
perience as teachera or examiners, and, apperig as it does at a tine when secondary education is "" in the air,"" it might be expected to throw light upon some, at least, of the problems connected vith a national system of secondary education, upon. which the country and Parliament must one day form an opinion. The essays are certainly well written, and the opinions expressed by the writers are eminently sensible. But it is a book for professional teachers rather than the general public. It is more concerned with technical details than with comprehensive principles-with the work of a sixth form, the arrangement of school lessons, the different systems of teaching appropriate today and boarding schools, the place of mathematics, science, or modem history in a school curriculum, the preparation for University scholarships or matriculation, and the likematters of great practical interest to those engaged in the work of education, but not equally interesting to others. Its field, too, is very much limited to the larger public schools in their relation to the Universities, and those who are familiar with public school and 'University work will, we suspect, find its conclusions somewhat obvious.
With this preliminary caution not to expect too much, we can recommend the book to those interested in practical education. The HigTh Master of Manchester Grammar School speaks with authority on the difliculties of day s^hool teaching; and, with regard to the superiority of the linguistic training in German as compared with English secondary schools, he points out, very truly, that the real difference lies in the conditions under which they work. There is in England "" no leaving certificate, as in Germany, required by all good firms of their clerks; there is no compulsory military service of which such a certificate will lessen the length. Boys leave school when their parents think that it is time for them to be getting to work, and not because they have reached any definite stage in their education."" Mr. Lowrv, an Eton master, writes on the "" Tutorial System "" atpublic schools ; and the Rev. H. M. Burge, in one of the best papers in thevolume, on ""Some Problems connected with the teaching of Sixth Forms."" Though only a college tutor at Oxford, Mr. Burge seems to have grasped somo of the principles that make a good headmaster. He demurs, wo think justly, to the modern notion that a headmaster should do little or no teaching, but devote himself to ' organization,"" thereby sacrificing what Arnold considered his golden opportumities,in which really great teachers have alwavs left their most permnanent mark.I Those who were pupils of Dean Bradley in the sixth form at Marlborough will bear us out. We are glad to see that Mr. Burge has also a good word for repetition and retranslation, now for the most part crowded out from an over-varied curriculum. The teaching of mathematics, science, modemu languages, and history receives appropriate and symnpathetic treatment from different essayists; and the London UYniversity matriculation examination and that for Oxford and Cambridge "" Higher Certificates "" are explained by the chairman of the Incorporated Association of Headmasters and one of the secretaries of the Universities' School Examination Board. Finally, another Eton master writes on "" Public School Athletics,"" and even he is constrained to admit that something is wrong in the present state of things. Schoolmasters, in fact, have encou-aged athletic sports, partly as useful for disciplinary purposes, partly as an opportunity for friendly intercourse with their boys, till the cultus of athletics has outgrown control, and threatens to absorb not only the time, but all the thoughts and interests of boys, whose general conviction, we are told, is "" that athletics are the one thing in the worldworth caring about."" Those who still think that boys aro sent to school in order to learn may well ask in respect to this athletic craze, Quoncque tandem ?
The latest addition to the "" Parnassus Library "" of GreeklandLatintexts is AESSY LUvS (Macmillan), edited by Professor Lewris Campbell, who contributes an introduction, with a limited number of critical and explanatory notes. Like other volumes of this series, the book is tastefuUy bound, and would be an attractive addition to any library even were its contents of less.valne than tbey are. Professor Campbell gives us a judiciously selected text,vwith but few experiments at emendation, and his notes are scholarly and helpful. The Greek type employed-an imitation of the
uncial ' character of early IMSS.-is a little puzzling at first sight; but it is very neat, and may possibly be more serviceable for a critical edition of the text, in which MSS. must be considered and discussed.
A Nzw Hssosr.
Wo have met the name of Mr. H. C. Macdowall now and then in the magazines, but, so far as -we know, H1 my or Gursi A-,D OTrER PoRaTRArs (Macmillan) is his first book. It is a book of much interest and real promise. The author has chosen a period and a group of subjects which must always retain their attraction for the modern world, and which,strange to say, have beensearcely tonchedbyE;nglishwritersof any historical pretensions,those wars of religion to vhich Michelet devoted two brilliant volumesO years ago. Since that date the researches of French scholars bave thrown new light upon the events and the actors in them; and besides, there is always room for studies mainly biographical, however vivid may be the general pictures of a period that have been painted by historians. Mr. Maacdowall's two principal essays deal with Henry of Guise, the leader of the League, and with Agrippa d'Aubigne, poet, historian, soldier, and Protestant clhampion, the friend of Henri of Navarre and-such is the irony of history-the grandfather of MIme. de Maintenon. A shorter and slighter essay deals with Catherine of Navarre, the sister of Henri DT., one of the martyrs of the religious quarrels of the time. But this essay is of altogether minor interest, only valuable as showing how a high-placed personage may be systematically made miserable for reasons of State. The essay on Henry of Guise, which covers 170 pages, is an admirable piece of historical work, in which the author has made singularly clear to us tho complex system of political and religious intrigue which surrounded the last of the Valois kings and marked the rise of their great rivals, the house of Lorraine. Three principles were at work in France-the principle of uncompromising Catholicism, headed by the Guises; the principle of royalty, -which centred in Catherine de Medici and her three short-lived sons, each of whom in succession wore the crown; and the principle of religous liberty, represented by the Huguenot gentry of the south and west of France, and their two great chiefs the noble Coligny and the time-serving but immensely dexterous and, in the battlefield, heroic Henri of Navarre. The historian cannot, of course, treat these independently; a picture of the Duke of Guise must have the other two elements as a background. This is the case with the work of _r. Macdowall, and in fact the chief fault we have to find with his essay is that the personal impression which it leaves upon the reader's mind tends to be lost among the, multitEde of facts relating to the time in general. We should have liked, for example, a clearer explanation of Guise's popularity with the people of Paris, and it might have been well to attempt a precise summnary of his character, which at present we
are leit to gather from a mass of incidents.
Again, that mysterious personage Henry m., with his youth of immense promise, his period of demoralization after his residence in Poland, and his strange renewal of strength in his nnal strn,u,glewithGuise,reqmiresmoro explanationtbna the historianoffers. Stillboththisessayandthaton Agrippa d'Aubignd, especially perhaps theolatter, since the subject admits of more concentration,
are of real interest. Mr. Macdowall has steeped himself in the contemporary chronicles and
memoirs; he writes withont prejudices and leaves
hisreader to draw his own moral conclusions;
and, in a word, he shows himself qualified to do more thorough work in French history than many Englishmen have recently been able or willing to undertake.
THE PoTsDAs GB;AD}zrts (Sampson Low).
There was no potentate in the early years of the 18th century who provided more material for
gossip and amused scandal-moncering in the Jourts of Europe than Frederi k William the
First of Prussia. "" For,"" as Carlyle says, "" he was lik-e no other King that then existed or had ever been discovered. . . . . Ho would have ibeen stmun e anvwhere - but amon=the daDner.
I Royal gentlemen of the 15th century, wh t wasto I be done with such an Orson of a King ?"" Most of
the stories tord about him are concerned with his | passion for tall soldiers,and it is principally of such
storiesthat Mr. J. B. Hutchinsons RoiwNcx OF A REGIUMNT is made up. Stingy as be was, the King was ready to spend almost any sums to keep up the standard of h.eight in his regiment of Giant Grenadiers, and the surest road to his favour wias to supply him with recruits. "" He who sends me tall soldiers can do with me whatever ho likes,"" he used to say; and, though they ridiculed him, his fellow-sovereigns were quick to take advantagre of his foible. He was far from relying entirely upon presents of men, however. Just3asthe Sultans of old had agents in all parts of their dominions to keep their harems supplied with beauties, so Frederick William had man-hunters all over Europe, usingr every artifice of cajolerv and force to gret their mnster huge soldiers. Tney stuck at nothing in pursUit of their prey. One party went so far as to enter a church during service and would have marched off with all the tallest worshipprs if a quick-witted priest ready with a suitable text-' Cast out the unclean thing from among you ""-had not roused the congregation to effectual resistance. ""MlIy brother the sergeant "" (as George IL called him) was often involved by the acts of his emissaries in difficulties with his neighbours, but he cared little so long as he secured his prey. He had his pet giants well looked after in a tyrannical way,but they had a hard time of it, and his caprices (as, for instance, when he thought a regiment seemed out of sorts and ordered every man to bs bled on the spot !) led to many unsuccessful attempts at mutiny. Blat the King was not the man to let disaffection flourish unchecked, andhis "" MeansofGraco,""-hisdaughter Wilhelmina's name for the regiment in reference to her father's pa:tiality towards those who increased its numbers-were only disbanded when they had played the part carefully designed for them by the King himself in his funeral ceremonies. Mr. Hutchinson has compiled an entertaining volume,though he does scant justice to Frederick William's character. He presents exclusively its eccentric and scandalous sides. Carlyle (whose name does not, by the -way, appear in Mr. Hutchinson's list of authorities) may have rated the King's volcanic talents too high, but it is a pity that we have not in the
'""omance of a Begiment'"" some suggestion that he was more than a half-mad drill-sergeant vwith no interest beyond his barrack gates.
A GrzEA Cnucrw SocraTy (S.P.C.K.).
This is an interesting, and withal mcdest, chronicle of a great and successful work. Few, perhaps, of those wvho passthe Christian Knowedge Society's premises in Northumberlandavenxue, breaking the line of monster hotels with its windows full of attractive books and pictures and maps, and recognize it for a great centre of religious publications, have realized how truly and for ow aong the S.P.C.K. has acted up to its name and principles bv "" promoting Christian knowledge."" This record of its history, Two 1UiDrDED YEARS, 16'J-1898, will well repay perusal. It was founded at the end of the 17th century, at a time of considerable intellectual upheaval followina upon the Reformation. The inhilosophical speculations of Hobbes, subverting natural distinctions between right and wrong, had led to the assertion of a natural basis for ethics, which in its turn suggested to Lord Herbert of Cherbury, Tindal, and other Deists the possibility of a natural foundation for religion; and this again stimulated inquiry in the field of natural philosophy. Newton, Locke, Descartes had sounded various depths of knowledge. In religion, the period of the Commonwealth had produced a flood of antagonistic sects, in opposition to all of whicch Quakerism sought another standard of faith than the Bible in the supposed light of the Holy Spirit. Religion and morals were alike at a low ebb when, in the comparative lull of =uroncan politics that followed the Peace of Ryswick in 1.697, the S.P.C.K. was founded by a veer, two lawyerS, a country gentleman. and a clergyman (Dr. Bray). The first schemne, entitled "" A General Plan of the Constitution of a Protestant Congregation or Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge,"" eontained also the germ of the "" S.P.G.,"" which, in fact, was an offshoot of the S.P.C.K. The two chief branches of work contemplated were in the"" plantations "" or colonies abroad and in parishes at home-in each case by the provision of libraries of saitable literature. Great efforts, as we see from the minutes, were made in the society's early days to combat Quakerism and free thought. And besides its interest in the plantations, the societv appears to have devoted attention to sailors in the Fleet and P'rotestant communities on the Continent, and to the education of the poor in the principles of religion.
This last, indeed, seems to have been one of its original objects; and at a meeting in 1699 a circular letter was addressed to "" clergy correspondents "" in which, lon"" before education was regarded as a matter of public importance, the lines of a system of national education on a religious basis were clearly laid down. Schools were founded by private subscriptions and the proceeds of sermons or lectures and were known as "" Charity Schools,"" at which the cost of "" cloathing a Poor Boy "" is given in 1706 at 19s. 9Md., in 1710 at 15s. id.; and that of "" cloathing a Poor Girl "" at los. 7d. in 170l, and 12s. lOd. in 1710. The annual service of charity schools, at which about 4,500 children were gathered under the dome of St. Paul's, was held for nearly 100 years (1782-1877) and was, as the compilers of this record point out, one of the earliest ways in which the cathedral was utilized for a large congregation. It is curious now to read that, after the death of Queen Anne, the charity schools were distrusted for their supposed Jacobite tendencies, apparently with some reason, as the society's records mention the need of choosing "" a master well affected to his Majestv and Government; "" and in 1716 the Archbishop of Canterbury thought fit to advise that any catechisms "" that meddle with political or party principles "" should be thrown aside as 4"" pernicious to the original Design of those pious Nurseries."" Partisanship, however, was steadilv discouraged by the S. P. C. K., whose guidance of the beginnings of national education was both wise and cautious; and the records in this volume might be studied with advantage by the hotter heads on either side of modern educational controversies. At each subsequent stage in the development of education the society seems to have risen to the occasion and enlarged its operations. The foundation of the National Society in 18l relieved the S.P.C.B. from the direct care of schools, but it did groat service to the cause of religious education by timlely grants to Church schools in 1870; and it is largelv due to its munificence towards t;he Churchtrajnig colleges that those institutions still hold the field in the training of our elementary school teachers. Of the societv's work
asaseat ublishin house, in the dissemination ofcheap high-t dliterature at home and abroad, and in translation of the Bible and other Christian literature into many strange tongues, the volume gives ful details, and we commnend to all who are interested in such work this record of a great purpose nobly conceived and faithfully carried out. It must be a very pre-
judiced mind that vould see in the ""promotion of Christian knowledge,"" according to the theory and practice of this society, anything but a benefit to mnkind.
SymrA AND EGYT (Methuen).
Professor Flinders Petrie's new book SymUA A-ND EGYPT FROM THE TimL EL A-sAa-rA LzrraRs (Methuen) will doubtless receive full notice from Egyptologists, for it is an important exposition of the results of one of the most memorable of the writer's discoveries. We, however, must be content with directing general attention to this marvellous record, which throws light upon a multitude of the intimate details of the pub li and private life of Egypt and Syria in the 14th century B.C.-that is to say, at a time not very distant from the
Eebrew invasion of Palestine. Mr. Potrie reminds his readers of the discovery of this mass of cuneiform correspondence at Tell El Amarna. A few years ago the natives, whl-e plundering about the ruins, and carrying off Akhenaten's bricks for their modern houses, lit upon this record chamber containing many hnndreds of tablets. Negleted by official experts, they were finally carried in sacks to Luxor for sale, but
""were largely ground to pieces on the way. What has been preserved therefore is but a wreck of what might have been had any ,nerson-eanal to tha occasion_mlaced his hand
upon them."" What were saved were bought for the British and Berlin Museums and for various private collectors, and these have been lately edited by a German savant, Hugo Winckler. Mr. Petrie goes over the ground again and gives a suminary, and in many cases a transcript, of the letters, with ample geographical and cbronological appendices. The addition to our knowledge made by these letters is nothing short of amazing, even when it is compared with the m.nv other discoveries of a like nature which have been made in Egypt durinz the last sixteen years. We find in it an elaborate correspondenee between the Egyptian officers in and about Syria and the King: accounts of insurrections, invasions, andvarious other political events going on exactly as they went on 800 years later, in ersian times; accounts of tribute and of presents of jewelry, gold, and slaves; and, what perhaps is the most remarkable of all, an absolute identity of names in many cases between the Syria of 1370 B.c. and the Syria of whatwe commonly call historical times, and even of to-day. Beirut, for example, was even at that day a flourishing city; so, too, was Jerusalem; and we have constant references to the invasions of the Khatti or Hittites, and of the Amurri or Amorites. One very curious point is suggested, though perhaps not quite established, oy Ilr. Flinders Petrie. Every reader of the New Testament has been puzzled by the reference in the Epistle to the Hebrews to Melchisedec, King of Jerusalem, "" without father, without mother, without genealogy."" Mr. Petrie ingeniously suggests that this means that Melchisedee was an elective chief and not an hereditary Prince, and he confirms this by pointing out, from these letters, that "" Abdkhiba of Jerusalem repeatedly used the formula ' neither my father nor my mother appointed me in this place, the strong arn of the King established me over my father's territory."" We must leave it to soholars like Canon Driver to say whether Mr. Petrie's tempting hypothesis is tenable.

The work of cataloguing the inexhaustible treasures of the British Museum proceeds apace, and we have to welcome the first volume of an important new section of it-TnE CATALOGa: or D.uAwnws ByY urrisir AnsTsr, and of ArtistB of Foreign Origin wrorking in Great Briiain (published by the Trustees). This has been done with great care by Mr. Laurence Binyon-another instance, by the way, that a poet may be a very useful public official. From Air. Sidney Colvin's prefac we learn that the catalogue is to be completed in five or six volumes, all of reasonable size; out from the accident of the Museum's possessing a very large number of drawings by artists who come under the early letters of the alphabet, this volume onlv takes us down to the end of the letter ""'C."" Naturally, a collection like that of the Museum, which is enriched from time to time by miscellaneous bequests or by the chances of the auction room, cannot be formed with any very scientific rercrd to proportion, and the number of an artist's drawings hich it may contain is no guide to his artistic importance. Thus it happens that the list of works by William Alexander covers 12 pages, and that those by Samuel James Ainsley are almost as numerous; whereas there is only one drawing by the charming artist Samuel Austin,one bv Alfred Clint, two by J. J. Chalon, and five by Sir A. W. Callcott. William Alexander was the first Keeper of the Prints in the Museum (1808), which accounts for tho Museumn possessing the original drawings that be made as artist to Lord Macartney's Embassy to China. The very large collection of the topographical London drawings by J. W. Archer were purchased from the gentlemau vho had commissioned them, and although they may not be of much artistic importance, they are of great historical value. Again the immense collection of Geortre Cruikshank's sketches, the mere 'list of 'Viich covers some 80 pages, was bequeathed bv the artist's executors. Posterity might have been content vith a small selection from these, but, on the other hand, we could spare nothing from the late 31r. John Henderson's splendid bequest of drawings by David Cox, which includes a number of the most beautiful of that great artist's works. Among recent artists who, without claiming a place in the first rank-, yet eminently deserve to be represented in the national collection, are such men as Randolph Caldecott and Edmund Calvert: in their works the MIuseum is very rich. Considerable historical interest, again, attaches to the large collection of drawings by MIary Beale, the pupil or imitator of Lely; by her and bv her son Oharles theMuseum possesses nearly 200 sketches, of which many are recognizable as contemporary portraits. Another -roup whichthrows light upon the history of art in lingland is the lar-e collection of the drawings, mostly portraits,%by Edward and Robert Byng, assistants of Sir Godfrev Kr,eller, "" for whom they painted drapery, and rhose unfinished pictures they completed at his death."" They are instances of that very common phenomenon in art history, the disappearance of a pupil's namne behind that of his master; undoubtedly one or other of them really painted many of the emisting works that we attribute to Kneller. On points of this kind Mr. Binvon's catalogue throws great light. and he therefore deserves the cordial thank ef all students of the English School.

Mr. Charles F. Lummis is a frequent contributer to American magazines of papers dealing with the life and character of the Spanish and other Old World races of the North American Continent. In "" The Land of Poco Tiempo,"" which we noticed some few years ago,he dealt with iNew Mexico and its strange peoplie mainly from a descriptive and picturesque point of view. In his worlk on MhIco OF To-DAY (Harper and Brothers)-largely founded on papers which have appeared in Harper's Ma.zinc-his object is more directly historical and political. He describes "" The Awakening of a Nation "" with great vigour, but in a rather sophisticated style. The work is, he acknowledges, a less "" definitive picture of Mexico to-day ""than ho had at one time desired to make it. But leisure and opportunity have failed him, and these pages are, in consequence, "" submitted, not as a description of hIexico, but as a finger-board along the path to comprehension. If hurried, they are not hasty; if generic, they do not lack the ancestryof detail; if friendly, it is not by ignorance ; and if they may help one, American to more neighbourly feeling for a nation we have every reason not to despise and not to dislike, my recompense will be ample for all the work [ would like to have done."" The extract may serve to give readers a foretaste of Mr. Luiamir's very peculiar and not very attractive style. We should better have appreciated his book if he could write plainly, simply, and straightforwardly. But in spite of a mannerism which often irritates and rarely charms 31r. Lummis contrives to draw a picture of Mexico which is full of interest and actuality. It contains a vivid portrait of Porfirio Diaz, the President, who has wrought such wonders in the regeneration of Mexico, and a stirring sketch of the strange adventurous career of one whom ho sems to regard as the Bismarck of the New World. Certainly the contrast which Mr. Lummis draws between the Mexico in which Juarez died andc the Mexico of to-
day is a very emphatic testimony to the patriotism and statesmanship of Porfirio Diaz.
LADY FaY or D.AusxGrTo,by Eliza Orme,LL.B. (Hodder and Stoughton), is a brief biography of a genial and active worker in many good causes, whose kindly deeds and gracious qualities were well known, not only in her native place and among her own people, but in many parts of the country. M^any of the details of the biography have been supplied by Ltady Fry's ozn family and by several of her own friends, although, as Mfiss Orme acknowledges, "" they doubted whether the life of one who had lived so much withiu her own home, and who had never sought publicity for its own sake, was a fittimg subject for publication."" The doubt was natural, but the reticence and simplicity of Miss Orme's method may well have removed it. She draws an engaging, but not too intisate, picture of a sterling character and of a well-spent life, vrorthy alike inits domestic felicity and in its public activity to serve as an example to others.

The last. portfolio mono&raph deals with GiNt8s BaONzas (Seeley), and is the work of Dr. A. S. MuTray of the Brish Museum. The 100 pages show all the qualities by which Mr. Murray's arebeological work has long been marked; full knowledge of the important collection under his charge, extreme caution in adopting new theories, and a deference, which the modern school regard as exargerated, to the authority of "" ancient writers ""-Le., Pausaniaa and Pliny. The title is mor comprehensive than the essy, for Dr. Muray scarcely goes. beyond the 3ritish Museu collection, though, of course, he refers on many occasions, for purposes. of comparison, to statues, whether in marble or in bronze, existing elsewhere. The bronzes chosen for illustration are fairly representative; the principal plates are those of a fine archaic figure of a woman of the sixth century n.e., the wonderful Castellani
'Hypuos,"" the ""Zeus,"" from Dodona, and the very beautiful heroic figure of a yonth.attribulted to the school of Lysippos. But the essay leaves us with the uncomfortable imnpression that very little is known, or is ever lely to be known, about the makers of Greek bronzes. We mnust be content to enjoy them, and to trace mere or less vaguely their evolution from epoch to epoch; but of the artists who made Te we can scarcely hope to recover even the names.
Lrrwsirv STxTssnur AnD Ora=s, by :Norman Hapgood (Dnckworth) is a group of essays by a Europeanized American whc has the cleverness of his race, the tricks of his culture, and the self-assertion of his year He patronizes and criticizes from the same lofty standpoint Lord Rosebery, Mr. lMorley, and Mr. Balfour, finding that the first "" has the virtues of the cultivated few and lacks the abilities that alone can reach the many,"" that the ""whole spirit "" of the second "" seems thin and quarrelsome,"" and that the style of the third is "" awkward, jerky, inaccurate, and inelegant."" These and many others are the usual judgments of the detached young man of the present day. Mr. Hap-ood is better worth hearing in his essay on Stenlhnl, which is founded upon a reading of Steuidhal himself, and is mot merely a recast of Bourget and St. Beuve. We regret, however, to see that this essay is dated 1894. it is so much the best thing in the book that we fear that MUr. Aapgood's talent makes no progress, but rather the reverse.

These early thinkers held an important place in the history of Greek thought, and much has been written about their systems; but the original material for their study is after all but scanty, consisting of fragments preserved by later writers, such as Aristotle, Theophrasus, Plutarch, the Stoics, aud the neo-Platonic philosophers There is also the evidence of the Greek "" doxographists,"" or students of early thought, who describedin their own language the opinions of earlier writers ; butthis is obvioisly of less valuce tan even such fragments of their actual writings as are here collected. Mr. A. Fairbanks, the edtor and translator, who we observe dates from Yale University, seems to have done his work well, and his book should prove useful for students of Greek philosophy.

Ylr. Willian fWatson is so good and true a ;poet, and his career is being watched with so pmuch interest-we had almost said *vith so much ;anxiety-by those to whom the future of English poetry is dear, that any mistake on his Tpart would bo a matter for real regret. By this ~we do not imply that it is a mistake for him to ihavepublished thethinvolume ealledTnEFATnzE
XoP THIE FOREST AND OTHER POEMS ; butwe think 'that he would have done better to keep it bac4k ;say for another six months, till tho 71 ages had increased to something over 100 and till the iappetite of his readers had had time to grow more kIeen. It surely cannot be very many months since we had the fine volume called "" Odes and .Other Poems,"" and since then two of the longest xf the poems included in the new collection, "" A Hymn to the Sea "" and "" At tho Tomb 'of Burns "" have appeared in periodicals. If with these the new volume had contained not two but half-a-dozen unpublished poems as important as "" The Father of the Worest ""and "" Apologia,"" there would not be the smallest doubt as to its success ; and the vroduction of the half-dozen poems of that quality as, with Mr. Watson, merely a question of a little 3iore time. After this mild protest we may proceed to confess that we have found in the new 'volume much that is entirely admirable, and tnuch that gives the same quality of pleasure that we derived from "" Wordsworth's Grave "" and from "" Vita Nuova. "" In the ""H Hymn to the Sea,"" which was widely read and much comrnented on when it first appeared, Mr. Watson has tried the unthankful experiment-we will not with Tennyson call it the "" barbarous experiment ""- 'of writing in Enlglish hexrameters and pentamneters, and he has made them positively enjoysable, especially in such lines ns these, which have sikeady almost become classical and whlich are
full of a new and very individual beauty:-
Wow while the vernal irapulsion makes lyrical all that
hath languhge,
While, through the veins of the Earth, riots the ichor
of Spring,
,Wbile, with throes, with raptures, with loosing of
bonds, with unsealings,-
Arrowy pangs of delight, piercing the core of the
world,-
Tremors and coy unfoldings, reluctances, sweet agith-
tions,-
Youth, irrepressibly fair, wakes like a wondering rose. The other long poem which has already appeared, "" The Tomb ofB= s,"" however good as poetry or as morality, is artistically a mistake, for Wordsworth has said the same thing before in almost the same form. "" The Father of the Forest,"" on the other hand, has the exclusive note of Mr. Watson's poetry ; as in earlier writings of his, we have a. stately procession of historic precedents followed, as in a duologue, by the answvering thought to which history appears as "" the babble of transient things,"" as contrasted with the ages before history began and with the ages that are to follow. But the ,most interesting of the new poems is that called
Apologia,"" a worthy pendant or sequel to the beautiful "" Vita Nuova,"" and in substance a reply to those crities who have charged the poet, on the one hand with imitativeness, and on the other with coldness and want of passion. We quote the second part of this reply as an example -of noble blank verse, in which the eohoes of the joet's great predecessors are not too distinctly ;eard, and also as an emphatic statement of a ,truth which the literary class in these days is too apt to forget
For though of faulty and of erring walk, I have aot suffered aught in me of frail
To blur my song ; I have not paid the world 'Thu evil and the insolent courtesy
Of offeriog it my baseness for a gift.
And unto such as think all Art is cold, All music nnimpassioned, if it breathe An ardour not of Eros' lips, and glow
With fire not caught from Aphrodite's breast, Be it enough to say, that in Man's life Is room for great emotions uabegot
Of dalliance and embracement, unbegot Ev'n of the purer nuptials of the soul
And one nut pale of blood, to human touch Nut tardily responsive, yet may know
A deeper transport and a mightier thrill
Than comes of commerce with mortality,
When, rapt from all relation with his kind, All temporal and immediate cireanmstanee, In silence, in the visionary mood
That, flashing light on the dark deep, perceive Order beyopd this coil and errancy,
Isled from the fretful hour he standc alone
And hears the eternal movement, and beholda Above hlim and around and at his feet, In millioa-billowed consentaneousness,

Besides the volume wilich we have already reviewed, some other poetical productions of the wveek claim notice, though mest of these are reprints. Mrs. Tynan Hinkson, already favourably'known to readers of poetry, has produced a little volume which she calls MIRACLE PLAYS
Oun LOnD'S CO?NG AND CHIDHOOD (John Lane) ; a group of versions of the early chapters of the Gospel, with a number of legendary additions, told in verse of an almosttoo conscious simplicity. The story of the Flight into Egypt, and of the healing of the leprous babe who afterwards grows into the penitent thief, is told with considerable charm. Mir. Patten Wilson's illustrations are prettily dosigned, bat might have been better drawn.- SON1NnTS AND SONGS, by May Bateman (Elkin Mathews), appear to have been written more or less under the inspiration of the "" Sonnets from the Portuguese."" It is refreshing to find in these days verse so passionate and at the same toime so little physiological.-TIIn SEA-KING'S DAUGE}ITER (G. Napier and Co., t3irmingham) claims attention as much for the outward form as for the matter. It is described on the title-page (which, by the way, comes at the end like a colo-
phon) as "" by Amay Mark, deeorated by designs byBernard Sleigh, engraved by the designer and by L. A. Talbot ; printed at the press of the Bir-
idgham Guild of Elandicraft ""; a sufficient indication that it is as much a work of ornament as a work of poetry. Tho decorations and the printing are certainly interesting, and the verse, when one contrives to decipher it, is rather pretty aud inelodious. It is not likely, however, to mako the reader forget ""the Forsaken Merman.""DRIFT, bv Beocles Wilson (Gay and Bird) appears to be the work of a Canadian autborof unimpeachable Datriotism,. proud of ""the 'Motherland "",

The verso is moderately good.-Among the reprints we have to notice the first two volumes of the "" People's Edition "" of Tennyson (Macmillan), apparently issued in emulation of the "" Temple Shakespeare. "" These tiny quartos, issued at one shilling eauh in decorated cloth bindinig, ought to be extremely popular. The first of them, which is entitled "" Juvenilia,"" contains a good many sonnets and songs which the author at one time suppressed, though, of course, they have long ago been rediscovered and several times reprinted.-A much more ambitious reprint is that of Shakespeare's nuStMirtE NIGHT's DanAn, with illustrations by Robert AnniAg Bell, and an introduction, in the form of a letter to a child, by Israel Gollanez (J. M. Dent and Co.). Mr. Anning Bell is a born designer, and in this book whether he draws the fairies, or Bottom and his company, or the decorated borders for his illustrations, the result is equally charming. Tho last few years have seen very many productions of the kind, but none more successful.-A reprint that has a real bibliographical as well as poetical interest is that which Mfr. A ndrew Lang has made of a curious poem called the DEATH-eAKE, written by Thomas T. Stoddart in the year 1830 (John Lane). The title page,"" The Death-Wake or Lunacy; a Necromaunt in Three Chimeras,"" would have delighted the new sect of the Romanticists in France, but in sober England and in soberer Scotland it must have caused, if anything, a throb of amazed horror rather than of pleasure. Mr. Lang's short introduction tells all that seems to be known of the author of this strange poem, who, after plunging at 20 years of age into the deepest waters of romanficism, became for the rest of his life an ordinary citizen and an enthusiastic a-ngler, only venturing again into verse as a writer of occasional anglng songs. The story of the Death-Wake is that of a mad monk, Julio, who loves a dead nun Agathe: a story, as nfr. Lang remarks, which won for the author the praise of7EdgarPoe, and which, to a certain extent, anticipates Theophile Gauthier and Thomas Beddoes. More important than the story is the execution; for Stoddart writes the tensyllabled couplet with extraordinary melodiousness and with a very individual note, "" no more the rhymed heroic verse of ' Endymion ' than it is that of Mr. Pope or of Mr. William Morris."" To our ear, indeed, it is a good deal like the verse of "" Endvmion, "" and it contains many an image, ,many a line, and many a cadence that Keats would net have disowned. Collectors of literary curiosities will be grateful to 3fr. Lang for his gift of a book which was well worth reprinting.-A small volume of Thoreau's PoEms orS NATcas, selected and edited by H. S. Salt and F. 13. Sauborn (John Lane), is also welcome,though the poetry of the New England transcendentalist and recluse will never rank so high as the prose records of his impressions of external nature. Thoreau was half a poeb, but only half; he had the feeling, the thought, in a high degree,ibut only a small measure of the gift of metrical expression. Still, out of all he wrote in verse there is enough good lyrical and meditative poetry to fill a small volume, so that the editor's task has not been in rain.-Dr. Islay Muirhead's translations fromn Lucretius, which he publishes under tho title of* Erioun-nAN SCIzNCn: AND POETRY, appear in a revised edition (John Bale and Sons).

Not nmany of our young poets belong of set purpose to that school which,under many names, has been for some years past enjoying a kind of success of curiosity in Paris-the suhool which dlepends primarily for its effect upon neologism and contortion of phrase. Ial. Verlaine and ,Iallarmd, to name two poets who have doubtless been long since outstripped by many disciples, would seem to consider that simplicity and poetry are incompatible, and that a verse or a poem is valuable in proportion to the amount of meaning that can be packed into it, provide(d al ways that to unfold the meaning demands a tremendous effort. We have hagd the same thing in Eingland in the days of Donne and Cowley, and it had a great nomentary success, bat not even our present-day curiosity about the past has ever been able to bring back Donne and Cowley into fame. lt is not,then,likely that any real success will attend the efforts of Mc. Francis Thompson, a writer of a very real talent of a certain kind, to convert the lovers of English poetry to a love of strange involutions of words, similes that have a conccit for their foundation, and verbal forms that ask to be recommended by their novelty. What shall we say, for example, when the poet shows us the air full of the misty forms of the Hours, and tells us how they-
Curd to the tincture which the opal bath,
Like rainbows thawing in a moonbeam bath ?
In Donne or (Urashaw we might find such an image highly characteristic, but we should hardly admire it and we should certainly not think it worth transplanting. Again, these Hours are prodigiously varied in their movements-
Some with languors of waved arms, Fluctuous oared their fiexile sway Some were borne half resupine On the aerial byalinec
and, when a pretty child appeared against the sunset, immediately the sun
Sublimed the illuminous and volute redundance Of locks that floated round her face.
On every page we have such terms as "" terrene,"" "" gracile,"" "" constellate,"" "" deliquious,"" "" agarics,"" and once the poet is positively not afraid to say that the night fires
Make every wave upon the harbour bars

Mr. Finck is an American, and writes primarily for Americans, but his book should meet with readers "" on this side "" as well, since it is brightly written, though not very profound. THE COUitT OF ST. CLOUD (H. S. Nichols and Co.) contains a series of letters which,although anonymous, are said to have been written by a gentleman named Stewarton to a friend in England in the year 1805. The volumes are issued as part of a series of Court Memoirs ; but, as there is no pretence of editing,and as the publishers do not even sfate if or when the book was published before, it cannot be taken with that confidence which would ba accorded to it if it were introduced in proper scholarly fashion. There are scores and hundreds of books of the sort, which,if reprinted with brief, straightforward introductions givingnames,dates &2c., would be deservedly welcome at theapreseni. time,when SO much.interest is felt in the history of t.he Revolution and the Napoleonic era.

Gurteen (Putnam), may be added to our somewhat long list of American publications, and commended as an intelligent and readable account of the large subject with which it deals. Mr. Gurteen writes like a scholar, and has studied his original authorities as well as the principal modern books on the Arthurian romances. CICERO iz DEFENCE OF CLUX5XTIVS, by WV.

A HISTOIty oF ENGLISH POETRY (MaCmillan).
Xr. Courthope has undertaken a task of monuMental proportions-a task whiel Pope conceived, from which Gray, who ht one time thought of undertaking it, was deterred by its magnitude, and tj' the fact that Warton was employed on a similar undertaking, and of which Warton himself only executed a classic fragment. Mfr. Courthope's high literary relputation, the nature of his previous studies, and the masterly execution of this the first portion of his task all attest his rare qualifications for the great work he has undertaken. The present volume deals with ""1 The Middle Ages * Influence of the toman Empire-The Encyelopadic Education of the Church-The Feudal System."" We are promised a second volume in the course of next year,which will deal with the poetry of the sixteenth century, showing the influence of the Court and the Universities on the art. Two further volumes will be devoted to the poetryof the seventeenth century, one of which will trace the culmination and decline of the poetical drama under the Stuarts, the other the decay of the medieval tradition and the growth of the classical influence in English verse composition from the reign of James I. up to 1688. A final volume or volumes will show the development of English poetry between that date and the Reform Bill of 1832. Mlr. Coutthope's method, as expounded in his Preface and in his Introductory chapters, and as eXhibited in the general execution of his work, appears to us to be singularly well conceived. "" By English poetry,"" ho says in his opening paragraph, "" I mean metrical compositions, written in our language from the period at which it becomes fairly inte.ligible to readers of the present day. By the Art of Elnglish Poetry I mean all characteristic writing of a metrical kind that can be classified under any of the recognized forms of compositionepic, dramatic, lyrical, or didactic. Aad by the History of the Art of English Poetry I maean, not simply an appreciation of the raotives by which each individual poet seems to have been consciously inspired, but also an inquiry into more general causes which have unconsciously directed imagination in this country into the various channels of metrical composition."" This prognant conception of the meaning and scope of his work gives unity and sustained interest to Mr. Courthope's treatment of his subject. It enables him to discern and appreciato the value of those less interesting of our earlier writers whom Taine summarily dismissed as "" those good people who speak without having anything to say. You may find them,"" adds Taine, "" in Warton."" So yo a may, but Wartoti, says Mr. Courthope, by simply collecting archaic materials without attempting to group and classify them, created a kind of distaste for the historic study of our early literature. Mr. Courthope himself sets about his task in a spirit at once more catholic and more historical. Acknowledging a breach of continuity, which some critics have failed to recognize, between the poetry produced in England before the Norman Conquest and the poetry of Chaucer, he nevertheless declines to recognize the latter as the unadulterated and unaftiliated product of a vague influence called the "" Renaissance.""
From Chaucer downwards we may distinctly observe in English poetry the confluence of three great streams of thought, whieh blend in a single channel without any of them ever quite losing its separate life and identity. Of these the farst,and perhap the most powerful,is the genius of Race, th stream of Igglo-Saxon language, character, and cn=tt, modified by the influence of Scandinavian imagination, as awell as by all the impulses and ideas derived from the Latin nations through the Norman Conquest. The second is the tradition of education systematized by the Latin Church; many traces of which stiU survive in the courses of our Universities and public schools. 'The third is the tradition of GrwcoRomzan culture, carried through the barbarous ages in ainy slender ducts and channels, vvhich, mingling the spirit of the ancient world with the infant civilization f Europe,i prepared the way for the great revival of aFtt and letters con monly known as the Renaissance.
This thesis is worked out at length in the present volumne with rare insight and scholarly erudition, and in particular the tracing out of the slender but never-exhausted stream of (Ordeco-Roman cilture through the ages com'ionly called dark is a masterly piece of work, ias original as it iB sound and imstructive.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS50519217/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=213107d4

The character and purpose of these brilliant Suggestive Lectures, delivered on the Percy Turnbull Memorial Foundation in the Johns Bopkins University of Baltimore, by the Regius Professor of Greek in the University of Dublin, may best be indicated in the Professor's own words, taken from the opening paragraphs of his introductory lecture as originally delivered:-
In the first of the lectures I take a very rapid sarvey of Latin poetry as a whole, never pausing to consider at all closely any particuilar poet, except in the case of one or two literary personages whose minuence on the course of Latin poetry seems to have been generally underrated, and to whom I shall not have an opportunity to recur in subsequent lectures. . . . The next lecture, too, dealing with the early Latin poetry, must still be of a somewlhat general cast. After that we shall be able to confine our attention mainly to individual ts, or to corn, or contrasted pairs of
Doe pai~~~oery ofth poets, until the consideration of the Poetry of the
Decline again makes it necessary to abandon the microscope for the field-glass, and to accommodate our vision to a wider prospect. . . I must aim at putting before you what I think most interesting in counoxion with Latin poetry, sometimes describing how certain masterpieces (fortof course, we shall be brought to consider some masterpieces) have affected myself. * . . I shall not attemp to give a life of each poet who may be under consider tion, except iu so far as the incidents of his career have lefi a distict impress on his work. . . . I shall have to *sk not what were the works of each poet, but what was his work ; how he looked out on the world, and what was the world on which he looked ; whether he had a messa to society, and how far lte succeeded in delivering it.
I shl be by no means an unvarying eulogist of Latin poetry. Indeed, in the case of some of the poets Ifear I shall run the risk of being caUed a harsh and unsympathetic critic. I shall have to put before yon many things which have often been said before. I have2 however, endeavonred as much as possible to avoid tracks that are too well beaten, and to dwell in preference on points of vies which may seem to have been comparatively neglected.
To attempt, it may be said, to say anything at the atme time true and new on such a thome as Virgil or Horace really seems out of the question. But it is a characteristic of philological and historical inquiry that the same subject admits of being viewed from very diverse points, and this is peculiarly true in dealing with poetry. Each actor, each musician, has a different way of rendering Shakespearo or Beethoven, and there is no final interpretation of the work of a great artist. Literature can do no more than give as the opinions and sentiments of particular persons , at particular times. To estimate-even to understand-these opinions aud sentiments we must know something of the times and circumstances in which they were expressed. It will be requisite, therefore, now and then, to invade the domain of history and bio raphy, and thus diversify our more purely literary studies.
This attractive programme is not less attractively carried ouat and no student of Latin literature wil fail to recognize the ripe scholarship, the sound critical faculty, the skilful literary presentation, and the suggestive originali;y of view.* so frequently displayed by Professor Tyrrell. We confess to a little surprise thlat the Professor should have thought it necessary to give English renderings-sometimes his own, sometimes those of other translators-of the illustrative passages quoted by him. This is rather a slur upon the scholarship of his audience and must surely be superfluous in any case; because a lecture on Latm poetry delivered to an audience unabquainted with Latin can hardly be rendered much more attractive or even more intelligible to such an audience by a translation of such passages as the lecturer finds occasion to quote ; the point of view and the general treatnentof the subject mnustremain asunntelligibleas before. And this must especially bethe case with a writer who,like Professor Tyrrell,is soimbuedwith the spirit of Latin literature that he could not if he would treat it ab extra, and must necessarily appeal to corresponding sympathies in his audience. We cannot here follow Professor Tyrrell's survey of Latin poetry in detail, but we may direct special attention to his strikin& appreciation of early Latin poetry, to his loity estimate of Catullus, to his courageous apology for the poetry of Cicero, and to his ingenious presentation of the thesis that Horace was neither sincere nor original as a poet, but that, like all the poets of his time, he ""' conceived it to be the function of his art either to reproduce in Latin the masterpieces of Greek literature or to adapt to the taste of his own age the old poets of his own land."" Thus we are told that ""the bore whom Horace met on the Sacred Way .
had no objective existence for Horace at all, but was only aLuoi1ian bore ich1auff;"" that ""it seems highly probable that the celebrated account of the journey to Brundusium-though no doubt the journey was actually made by FHorace in the company of MBecenas-is not a genuine record of adventures which they actually met, but rather a polished version of a piece in which Lucilius gave a versHfied account of a journey from Rome to Capua and thence to the itraits of Messina,"" and so forth. It would be eqjuaily pleasant to follow Professor Tyrrell in his admirable appreciations of Lucretius, Virgil, and Juvenal, not to mention other poets only less supreme than these ; but we must say that he seems to usto be a little hard on Persius. While doing full justice to the fine ethical fervour of Persius he is irritated, as all critics must be, to some extent, by the contortions and eccentricities of his style. The Professor says of him that he II seems to have laboured under a failing rife in our own literature at present, and to have been physically incapable of saying a plain thing in a plain way.""i That is true, and Persius is for that reason often the most exasperating of Latin writers. But we can, and ought to forgive much to the writer of the'line

Null,"PANSIES, a Book of Poems by May Probyn",The Times,1895-Mar-29,"London, England","k'ANSIES, a Book of Poems bn May Probyn (Elkin Mathews), is full of a delicate devotional sentiment and not without much metrioal feliCity. RELIG1O OLRnxcI, by Alfred Starkey (Elliot Stock), is a volume of verse in which the religious motive is stronger than the poetic. Mr. Starkey tells in his preface that one of his poems was submitted to "" Matthew Arnold and others of the worthy dead. Arnold very clearly saw that the vein, if genuine, was thin. He therefore, to prevent disappointment, did not counsel much further exploration of the mine. ' Let your poetry,' said he, 'be its own reward.' The counsel was wise and has been well followed by a mnn who has never taken too much interest in himself."" It is not for us to gainsay this piece of selfcriticism, so frank and withal so modest. In BALAsZS and other Poems, by A. H. Beesly (Longmans), and Ix A GARDXE and other Poems, by H. C. Beeching, we have two volumes of scholarly verse, objective and subjective, melancholy and joyous, speculative and descriptive, original and imitative. Of PLAYER PoRs, by Robert George Legge (Innes), there is not much to say except that they are mostly topical pieces relating to the theatre, its properties and personalities, written in a dialect not always easy for the uninitiated to follow. Of his little volume of LyBiCs (Stewart) Mr. R. R. Fitzpatrick writes, "" The hawksvwill tear thee, little book."" iMr. Fit4patrick may take heart of grace. Hawks fly at higher quarry, and his Lyrics, though at times rather too frankly erotic, are not without melody and fancy. Of TnB DIvYIX S1aBRNDERx a Mystery Play, by William Wallace (Elliot Stock), the author gives the following expl&nation ;-"" My aim has been, in the first place, to dramatize a portion of sacred history in such a way as to make it possible on the stage. In the second place I have attempted to give an unprejudiced
view of the attitude of the Three Sects concerned in the matter."" The aim is ambitious, and, in view of the subject-matter, perhaps almost unattainable. But Mr. Wallace's treatment of the problem is not without dramatic ingenuity, and his blank verse is smooth, though it scarcely rises to the dignity of his theme. Of his SoNos OF THE SEA AND LAYS OF TaE LAND (Black), Mr. 0. G. Leland explains that the sea-pieces, not all of which are original, are devoted to the portraiture of the mariner of the sailing ship who is now rapidly passing away, and that the other ballads are a series of eccentric pictures of American life after the war. ""These Ballads,"" he adds, "" make no great pretence to be poetry : they consist of incidents or small ' motives ' cast into rhyme or measure as the easiest method of giving them a certain value, just as a tune brings out a song."" This is a very modest description of a volunme in which Mr. Leland displays very attractively his love of quaint folk-lore, his curious commarnld of dialect, his felicitous application of metre to topic, and the rare humour which long ago created the immortal "" Has Breitmann",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS219470973/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=b413817f

Null,Mr. Leslie Stephen On Books,The Times,1895-Feb-25,"London, England","MR. LESLIE STBPHEN ON BOOKS.
Mr. L1MSLIX STEPHEN' gave a lecture on Saturday evening, at Toynbee-hall, on.the choice of books. Calling attention to the passage in the Life of Charles Darwin in which the great naturalist, at the age of 67, 4dmnited that be no longer took any pleasure in Shakespeare, oL in poetry generally, or in music, and, deplored the atrophy of the higher part of his brain,. Mr. Stephen observed that. the case of Darwin was in this respect by. no means- singular. Miss Mitford confessed to a similar weakness, which was shared even at times by Mr. Ruskin and Charles Kingsley, Perhaps it was that advancing years brought so many real troubles that one could take little interest in imaginary ones. Even literary men themselves did not appear to. concern themselves much- with the masterpieces. of their. craft,. which he too often at the clab found lying: dusty on the shelves, whilst there was a competition for the last number of Pwrnch or the latest French novel. He wel
remembered his undergraduate, enthusiasm for Tennyson.
nut Uow it was in vain to try to revive those early fires. As he read anew. he became conscious- of blemishes -here and there a. ifalselnote, now and a,sin a weak line. Thus even literary studies. transformed themselves into objects. of science, and too often we did not-,. like Wordsworth, find consolation in the "" years that bring. the philosophic mind."" What, then, was. the spirit in. which our literary friendships. should; be formed in early years so that they might lasb through' life ? His advice tn is regard wold e partly, ""Take no advice whatever."" Mr. Frederic Harrison had discoursed on the choice of book.s in some excellent lectures, and he agreed witb all that Mr;Harrison had said of the necessits of cultivating acquaintance with the masterpieces of aterature. But he approached the -subject from a different pornt of view. First, we should bear in miad that the power of appreci3ting a great work was the result of thorough training. On the firslI readiag one is. i..pressed by those qualities which genius. shares-with its infers. 'l'here are points in common between M-ilton and Robert Montgomery. If the great writer is distant in time, the needful training is long and difficult, for everyone writes in the dialect of his own day and is subject to the influences of contemporary thought. The great lessens of Dante, fbr example, are embedded'in aa exploded philosophy and a forgottea mythology. Thus permanent value iattaehes to lasting thought, which is found, like ore, in matter of ephemeral interest. Tastes inevitably change. It is idle to complain that Pope's versification ceases to charm, that Scott is out of fashion, that Dickens does not make people' laugh-as he used. Literature, we. are told, is the criticism of 'life but criticism, as Tennyson's farmer said of the moor is i in the. lImp, bad."" It is only good so far as it stimulates the living process and we can remove the superficial mirustabions and reach the fire beneath. Mgher criticism eudeavours to lay bare the-author's spirit, but it. does- so- too often after the maDner of the reviewer who foand; fault with the republished: preface to Johnson's Dictionary, because it disclosed no ac-
uaimtanca with the researches of the- l9th centu
aughter.) The acquisition of a theory too-often ifis sensibility. You cannot make a cricketer by.tenacin
the laws of motion, or a mausician by the mathematic,. theory of sound, The- critic too often- migtakes his function, and instead of being the discoverer of facts imagines himself to be a legislator in taste. It should. not be forgotten that great authors had, been fed on books which were now forgotten-Milton by the poems of Da Bartas, Coleridge by the odes of. Bowles,. Goethe by Ossian. He would say to all, ""T Take the path which realy invites you."" One of his own eaiiest fascinations was Borrow's "" Bible in Spaiu"" wlach o blendecd the charms of missionary enterprise with those. of Bohemian adventure that he was surprised that he did not run away' and join the nearest gipsy encampment. Then he read Borrow's "" Fini'terre,"" which led him to Washington Irving's "" Conquest of.Gkanada."" After that he made the aCquaintance of the inimiitable Boswell, which has all the ineffable charm of Montaigne's Essays,. and which, li3ke Montaigne, unfolds to us a, microcosm which, though not in all respects dignified or edifying, was at all events infintely diverting. Then he- read Boswell's Corsica,. in, connexion with which it was said. that any fool could write a good- book if he only spoke-the truth;. One of the great excellences of Boswell' ws his- extraordinary vivacity of expression, and he had the: merit, too often overlooked both int literature. and art, of knowing what- not to say. Boswell makes us honorary members of that venerable society in which figure. Goldsmith and Garrick,. Burke, whose. powers.of coanversation equalled, those of the great doctor himself'
Bennet, Langton, the. slim, long-legged' gentleman like. the stork in Iaphael's cartoon (laughter), and others.
We are now learning the~ charm of that much denounced' 18th century, when there- was society, even in London, cosy, quiet, stimulating,, and- when human intercourse was- not drowned in the' limitless ocean of journalism, and publicity. There was a perennial interest in' the
""Vicar of Wakefield "" which did not attract Dy casting aside all decency. There were doubtless in Goldsmith's day some real- vicars of Wakefield. Thea there was' White of Selborne observinfr the historic tortoise or the somersaults of rooks. whilst Burgoyne's army wasbeing defeated at Saratoga. There was. the gentle Cowper, when relieved: from. his terrible mental disorder, writing those letters in which there was so much to soothe and refresh to his maidea liadies. Letters, too, of a widely different character, but full of interest, were found: in the nine volumes of Horace Walpole, who. repudiated Johnson as one of the umw]ashed and regarded Cowper as a mere methodist.
Vast stores of amusement and instruction were to befound in. half a. dozen collections which might be mentioned-tbe ' Gentleman's Magazine,"" the "" oAnual Register,"" and wvhat was his own favourite, the "" Stakte Trials.""

Fact is never quite as interesting as fiction, and MIr. Littlechild does not soar into quite the same atmosphere as the late Mr. Sherlock Holmes ; but he is readable -enough when he tells us of his raids upon sham loan offices or of his tracking of forgers, or his adventures in the matter of the Turf frauds,and also when he tells of his not infrequent disappointments and defeats.

The selection of these English lyrics is the justification of (r. Watson's preface, whichmight otherwise lay itself open to the charge of canrying eulogy to excess. Mr. Watson has, in our opinion, vindicated the soundness of his judgment and his literary discrimination by the specimens he has selected. In one way we are inclined to go farther than he does, for we prefer Mr. Austin's simpler vein to his more amibitious efforts. At homne or on foreign soil, on the earth, in the heavens, or in intermediate spheres he is always a poet; but he never sings so sweetly or so melodiously as in England. Mr. Austin, we are told with truth, ignores Nature-that is to say, the idol or fetish of formal and metaphysical poets. On the other hand, he is in the closest communion with the buoyant nature that is weeping or smiling in our surroundings through the changing seasons. "" That, says Mr. Watson, ""is why I consider him in the truest and best sense a Nature-poet."" In fact, Mr. Austin has been setting an example, with the just balance of sense and sound which "" future generations will loos for in their poems."" We can only hope that the example will be generally imitated, and that future generations will not be disappointed. For all through these lyrics we have a harmonious blending of pleasing melancholy with genial mirth, and they are rich in those shades of realistic description which remind us of "" The Queen of the Mflay"" and ""ILocksley Hall.""
Take the brightness of ""I A Birthday,"" which appropriately opens the volume. The poet revels in the sights and sounds of the present,regardless cr unconscious of what the future may have in store
The earliest sound that greeted me
aVas the ousel's ringing tone
The earliest sight, lambs frisking free
Bound barked oaks newly thrown.
Then comes in ""' Primroses "" and "" A Defence of English Spring,"" a fre7sh breath of the English spring-time with which he preladed his Italian "" Human Tragedy."" Even with poetical licence it is no easy task to defend satisfactorily MEarch winds and cold April showers. At least, Mr. Austin makes the best of things, and almost persuades us that we ought to enjoy the weather of both months. There is no denying the force or the charm of his painting when he invokes the memory to the aid of his muse -
Nowfrowns the sky, the air bites blealk, -
The young boughs rock, the old boughs creak, And fast before the following gale
Come slanting drops, then slashing hail.
WVe heartily agree with him when he revels in the delights of the field flowers and the fragrant bloom in the old-fashioned gardens -
The blue bells with the grasses mingle But soon their azure will be scrolled Upon the primrose cloth of gold. Yes, there are early lady-smocks
The children crumple in their frocks.
And with them knolls that now are bare Will be a blaze of lavender.
What lends yon dingle such a sheen i
How ! buttercups ? No, celandine. kc.
There is a pathetic simplicity in the homelike realism of the ""Farmhouse Dirge,"" Ywhere the, bereaved mother, seekin- distraction from her sorrow in the familiar household cares, is full now of her grief and now of her bees and her poultry:
_tbdoes one good to talk of it all, and grief feels
doubled when domb.
An the butter's not quite so good this week, if you
please, ma'nm, you must not mind.
There is delightful and homely pathos, too, in ""The Last Night,"" when the youth,on the eve of starting for the colonies, takes his sister for a sad farewell to their favourite haunt in the chestnuat grove. In "" Love's Widowhood "" there is another richly-coloured Venetian picture of the old flowers that blaze in rank luxuriance in the borders of a cotta-e garden .-
018-fashioned balsains,snapdragons red and white, In which the sedulous bees all day were throng. Mloon-daisies tall and tufts of crimson phlox, And dainty white anemones that bear
An eastern name and eastern beauty wear.
Even after Shelley's ode we can still admire the song of "" The Owl "" and "" The Lark,"" and finally, by way of showing the poet in his patriotic vein, in "" At his Grave "" we have a spirited tribute to the patriotism, genius, and services of Lord Beaconsfield. Even Radicals, although they may not assent to the sentiments, must admit
that it is fine poetry :- I
But, he unwitting youth once flown,
With England's greatness linked his own,
And steadfast to that part,
Held praise and blame Dut fitful sound, And in the love of country found
Full solace for his heart.

Null,Mr. Swinburne's New Volume.*,The Times,1884-Nov-12,"London, England","MB. SWIBUBNRE'S NEW VOLUmR,*
This now volume by Mr. Swinburne contains no fewver than S6 distinct poems, eight only of which have previously seen the light. The whole sEries may bo divided into idyllic, personal, and political poems. Lovers of poetry aS poetry will be charmed by much graceful verse in the firat aection; admirers of Victor Hugo, Mazzini, Richard Doyle, Louis Blano, Migs Rossetti, and Mr. Henry A. Bright (a sufficiently catholic portrait gallery) will welcome the second; while the poems in the third section are likely to divide readers at the present political erieis into hostile camps.
Powerful and full of energy as the political poems cndoubtedly are, for ourselves we may say in the outset that we prefer the idyllic and personal poems. Tho poet is here seen at his best; bo touches felicitously upon questions deeper than the ephemeral excitements of politics; and while we get much of the swing and the melody which bave always distinguished Mr. Swinburne's poems, there aro also traces of ripening thought and judgment. The collection of poems which furnishes the title of the volume, ""' A Midsummer Holiday,"" aro nine ballads inscribed to Mr. Theodore Watts. They aro not ballads in the loose and inaccurate sense usuaIly understood by ths,t word; but are constructed upon the strict principles of old French versification. According to Richelet a ballad is really a song consisting of threo strophes or stanzas, of eight verses each, besides a half strophe ; the whole ir rhymo of two, three, or four verses, with a burden repeated at the end of each strophe, as well as of the half strophe. This is the construction Mr. Swinburno has literally followed, and he has successfully grappled with the conditions. The locale of thcse country poems is, we believe, to be found in tho most beautiful coast secnery of Norfolk, near Cromer. 'The ballad of ""Tho Seaboard "" emphasizes a tbought that must often have occurred to the refleutive mind ander similar circumstances:-
""The waves are a joy to the sea-mew, the meads to the
herd,
And a joy to the heart is a goal that it may not reach. No senso that for ever the limits of sense engird,
No hearing or sight that is vassal to form or speech
""Learns ever the secret that shadoi and silence teach, ""iRears ever the notes that or ever they swell subside,
""Sees ever the light that lights not the loud world's
tide,
'Olasps ever the cause of the lifelong scheme's control
Where through we pursue, till the waters of life be
dried,
""The goal that is not, and ever again the goaL
""Friend what have we sought or seek we, whate cr
betiae,
""Though the seaboard shift its mark from afar descried,
""But aims whence erer anew shall arise the soul.
""Love, thought, song, lifo, but show for a glimpse, and
hide
""The goal that is not, and ever again the goal.""
The Ode to Victor Hugo dexterously interweaves references to many of the French poot's finest writings. As a Voetic effort it illustrates both Mr. Swinburne S strength and his weakness. It exhibits all his strength of verse with all his faults of exaggeration. Yxctor Hugo is unquestionably a fine genius-take him altogether, perhaps, the greatest genius of our time; but this foes not constitute hlun a Homer or a Shakespeare. Yet, if wo cannot endorso in all its fulness the rapturous eulogium pronounced by Victor H-ngo's admirer, we can at least admire the vigour and poetic force of strophes like these
""o mystery, whence to one man's hand was given
""- Power upon all things of tho spirit, and might Whereby the veil of all the years was riven
"" And naked stood the secret soul of night I
0 marvel, hailed of eyes whence cloud is driven,
""I That shows at last wrong reconciled with right ""By death divine of evil end sin forgiven !
0 light of song, whose fire is perfect light
No speech, no voice, no thought, Nso love avails us aught
TFor service of thanksgiving in his sighbt

'Life, everlasting while the worlds endure

""1 That not till time bo dead shall this man die. ""Love, like a bird, comes loyal to his lureo
f Fame flies beforo him, wingless else to fly.
""A child's heart toward his kind is not moro puro,

""All crowns before his crown ""Triumphantly bow down
""For prido that one more great than all draws nigh a

""One heart benign, one soul supreme, one conquering
name.""
The eamo fault of excessive laudation mars the lines on the death of Mazzini. That great and conspicuous services were rendered by Mazzini to Italy no one can dispute, and there are few who would call in question his high-souled patriotism. But these stanzas are extravagant;-
"" Since man's first mother brought to mnortal birth
IHer first-born son,
""Such grace befell not ever man on earth
4f ""As crowns this one.
Of God nor man was ever this thing said,
"" That he could give
""Life back to her who gave him, whence his dead
"" Mother might live.
But this man found his mothert dead and slknin,
'W With fast-sealed eyes,
""And bade the dead rise up and livo again,
""And she did rise.
I I * t t

""F For sovereigir son
""Be prouder that thy breast hath later nrfkt

""Glor be his for ever, while his land
ILives and is free,
""As with controlling breath and sovereign hand
"" He bade her be.
""Earth shows to heaven the names by thousands told
""T That crown her fame,
""EBt highest of all that heaven and earth behold
"" Mazzini's name.""
"" Les unasquets "" celebrates an incident connected with the lighthouse rock which forms one of a commanding group of natural towers off tho island of Guernsey. Tho grand and solitary position of these rocka affords fall scope for all Mr. Swinbarne's picturesqueness of treatment; but his talent is not conspicuously adapted for the dramatic treatment of incident. The same remark applies to the "" Ballad of Sark.""
Readers of the author's recent volume of child poems will not need to be assured that he writes with much tenderness in bis "" Oradle Songs "" and 'I ine Years Old."" But more general interest will centro in such efforts as "" ,eartseaso Countrv,"" addressed to the poet's sister, "" A Doublo Bakad of August, and "" Maytirne in Midwinter."" We must ex;tract a few stanzas from the last-named
""The world, what is it to Ion, dear,
"" And me, if its face bo groy,
""And the new-born year be a shrowd year
"" For flowers that the ferco winds fray? ""You smile, and tho sky seems blue, dear;

This is dainty writing, and in a welcome vein to which Mr. Swinburng has not scoustomed us.

Judging from the denuucichtions Mr. Swinburne hurls atthe Houso of Lords in the closing poems of his volume, the peers nava no stronger enemy than himself.

Null,Walter Savage Landor.*,The Times,1883-Jan-03,"London, England","VIAMMJ MA-laB LA2WM0R.
In these two charming volumes, the one containing a life of Landor and the other selection3 from his prose and verse, Mr. Colvin has, it seems to us, done a service to the cause of what is best and highest in literaturo, such as a modern critic has not often the happy chance of accomplishing. Recent years, indeed, hnve been frtuitful in admirable judgments on poets and poetry, delivered often by brother craftsmuen, wel qualified both by native gifts and acqtured ski,]l to pronounce on poetical work. But the umuerous volumes of selections or of biography, in which we have all taken pleasure, have, with a few exceptions, handled themes long sinca familiar to popular interest and admiration. The interest of each book has depended not so much upon the subject matter, which was well known and accessible in manv other shapes, but upon the contact between it and the critical mind at work upon it. We have had Mr. S.vinburne on many poets, old and new ; Mr. Matthew Arnold on Byron and Wordsworth; 3Mr. Symonds on Shelley. As far as the poets themselves went, the world would probably have gone on reading them whether the critics had delivered themselves or not. The attraction of criticism and selections has lain first and foremost in the relations between judged and judge,in the effect produced by the well-known and often-discussed work of another generation upon the finest minds of our own. To Mr. Colvin's volumes, however, belongs the charm not only of fine literary relation, the true charm of criticism, but of a auasi novelty of aubject besides. Reverend and faudiliar as tne name of Walter Savage Landor has been all through to an dlite literary few, it is a mere commonplace to say that to the general reading public he has always been and still is practically unknown. In the first place, his works, either buried in a number of rare volumes, or gathered into a large and bulky collection, have been difficult of access; in the second, his inequalities, his obscurities, his moer length, to name nothing else, have stood persistently in the way of popularity. Even on his own generation, occupied with many of the same thoughts and ideas which moved him, he had little effect,and howmuch farther off from him stands the world of to-dlay than the worldof Shalleyand Keats. Lander, who was well aware of his ineffestiveness as far as his contemporaries were concerned, had, in revenge for it, a boundless confidence in the future. ""Ishaldinelate, hesaid,superbly, ""butthe dining room will be well lighted, the guests few and select."" Or, again, "" The worms must have eaten us before we rightly kinow what we are. It is only when we are skeletons that we are boxed and ticketed and prized and shown. Be it so; I sha1lnot be tired of waiting."" There are some who, like Mr. Leslie Stephen, doubt whether this trust of Landor's was really well-founded. And, indeed, had his work been left in the shape in which it was originally put forth, it would probably havs fallen more and more out ot reading so slender is the connecting link between farge portions of it and th edominant sympathies of to-day. From such a fate, howvever, it has been in our opinion, saved by Air. Caolvin's skilf
and adequate selections. His little volume, containing as it does all that is most perfect in LJander's prose or verse, can hardly fail to spread the knowledge of this great, though perverse, artist far bayond the limits it has hitherto reached. M1r. Colvin has, as it were, recovered and caged for us one of the austorest and most remote, but at the same time; within his own range, one of the most exquisite of singers. Brought so close to our eyes and ears as he now is, it will be hard indeed if the world does not listen to him and delight in him more than it has listened vet.
MIr. Colvin's biography of Landor is, of course, largely based upon the Life by Forster, but tho later writer has been fortunate in havina been allowed access to some valuable unpublishea materials,mostly iu the possession of Mr. Browning and Mr. Augustus Hare, and has, besides, had the help of whatever monographs on or reminiscences of Landor have appeared since Forster's day. To the biographical use of them he has brought a much more highly trained literary faculty than Landor's first biographer, with al his fidelty and affection, could dispose of, and the result is that we have not only a lively and interestingsketch of Lanior's life, but connected with it and surrounding it an excellent series of critical judgments upon Landor's works, in which all that the impartial friend can have to to say of it has been probably finally stunmed up. There aro many things, indeed, that TIr. Leslie Stephen says, in his remarks on Landor contained in the ""Hours in a Library,"" which Mr. Colvin does not say; but then Mr. Stephen writes, not as a friend, but as one who has been too much irritated by Landor's eccentricities to appreciate his qualities as keenly as he feels his defects. This is not the spirit which any one can fairly expect from a biographer, nor would he be properlyfittedfor his task if be had it. At the same time Mfr. Colvin is very far from blinking Landor's real faults, moral or literary. Both in the biography and in the preface to the
' Selections "" he carefully defines what be believes to be his chief defects as a writer-his lack of argumentative power and of the sense of sequence, and the absence in him of true literary tact, so far at anyrate as his relations to his reader are concerned; while iu the IAfe he brigs into clear view the wild,ungovernable temper which left its mark upon every stage of Landor's careerandwas always hurryiAg him from one scrape into anothar. The crises in his life were,in fact,all so many quarrels. He left Rugby because of an act of insubordination for which he entirely declined to offer the smallest amends; he was sent down from college because of some mad attack upon a fellow undergraduate's rooms for which he would make no apology; a quarrel with his fatber sent him to live by himself in London, Wales, and elsewhere; and when he married he quarrelled, not indeed altogether without reason, with his wife, at first temporarily, and then after nearly 80 years of married life hopelessly. The breach cost him his chilEren, whom he loved dearly, and his Italian home, but be was incorrigible by experionce. A worse quarrel than any, and attended by the most miserable consequences, drove him out of England again at the age of 83, and beforo he died he had even contrived to fall foul for a time
or J31x. Iforster, the most untiring and the most devoted of friends. NIever were quarrels worse managed or less profitable to the man who made them. In defiance of Polonius, Landor would rush into a fray without a thought of consequences, but being iu it he bore it so that his opponent hal far more reason to laugh at him than to beware of him. After a wrangle with a country attorney, he would SUppOS3 that everything had been gained when he had belaboured his enemy in some brilliant Latin verses; and when he had thrashed another brother of the law for insulting him, the only course his practical wisdom suggested to him was to escape the trial, a line of action involving a flight abroad and the consequent handing over to trustees of his Welsh property, Llanthony Abbey. Yet, in spite of all these strange ungovernable outbursts, Landor's most noticeable qualities. perhaps, through life, paradoxical as it may sound, were courtesy, sympathy, and generosity. His rage worked itself off in fits of laughter, scarcely less formidable to the byLstander; he could always forget his grievance in his beloved Latin verses; dogs, children, and young girls could win from him almost any service and to those few friends whom he loved best, and with whom he had no opportunity of quarrelling, he was one of the most loveable and noble-hearted of men. Throughout life he was an ardent politician; but in spite of muchthat isshrewd and weighty in his various political writings, his politics really were little less wild than his temper. The t,vo ends of his political creed were perpetually tugging him different ways. On the one hand he hated kings and priests with a fierceness which is by no means without its touch of comedy for the bystanders. As a young man it was impossible for him to enter the Army, for no regiment would admit such a republican firebrand as he was generally believed to be. In his earliest poem, "" Gebir "" (1798), the hero is described as meeting George III. in the nether regions, "" a wretch with eyebrows white and slanting brow,"" and the triumphs of the French Republic over empires and thrones are revealed to a supposed ancestor of the French nation, as fraught with "" glory that shall strike the crystal stars."" As life went on his Jacobin fervour never deserted him, as it deserted Wordsworth' and Southey. Re grew, indeed, to

hate the Irench as the betrayers of iSberty ; but for the cause of peoples versus kings his enthusiasm never wavered,and in his old age we find him witing passionately to Emerson to defend tyrannicide, or hanging rapturously on the news of Garibaldi's successes. Never was he more sincere and never was he more eloquent than wheu he was glorifying Liberty as he understood it. Hle makes Scipio say of the last desperate defence of Carthage *

Never w ill I call upon thee where thy name can be prefaned and never shall my soul acknowvledge a more exsAted power than thee.""
These are fine words, and Laudorspoke them from his heart. iBut democrat as he was towards kings or cardinals, for the practical machinery of democratic governments he hai scarcely any sympathy at all. He had a truly Carlylese belief ingreat men as against "" the vulgar,"" cared nothingfor the franchise questions with nhich histim3was full, and actually prided himself on never having exercised a vote or entered a political meeting. In the cause of the poor at home or the oppressed abroad, his pen was always ready. He saw clearly the great ends of liberty and public virtue; but his grasp of the means by which they might be attained was little less than childish. When Carlyle called him a mere rebel, Landor protested indignantly that in his eyes Venice was the pattern State, and that he despised Republicanism of the American type. To point the modern inquirer to Venice as a model is, as Mr. Leslie Stephen pertinentlyremarks,""simply to say that you have nothing but contempt for all rolities. It is as if a lad should be asked whether he preferred to join a cavalry or an infantryregiment, and should reply that he would only serve under Leonidas !
Of Landor's literary friendships Mr.Colvin draws an interesting and, on the whole, a very attractive picture. His devotion to Southey is well known. As Byron put it-
"". . . that deep-mouthed Bceotian, Savage landor, ""Has taken for a swan rogue Southey's gander.""
Landor's admiration, indeed, must be admitted to have had a touch of absurdity in it, when we find him classing Shelley as the third poet of the age, the firsb boing Soutbey, and the second Wordsworth. But on the whole his relation to Southey ranks as ono of the few golden threads in Landor's ragged and rudely-woven life. The affection between them never failed from the moment when Southey first made eager acquaintance with the unknown author of "" Gebir "" till the lips of the elder friend closed for ever upon tho murmured name of the younger. His friendship witb Wordsworth was much less intimate, end had its times of eclipse. Wordsworth's narrow and prejudiced literary taste disgusted Landor, whose reading was immense, and who was never at any time of his life afflicted withthat blindness towards the gifts of others which made Wordsworth somet,imes a disappointing companion. X reported saying of Wordsworth's, that he would not give fhve shillings for all the poetry of Southey, sent Landor rus~hing wildly into print for the defence of his friend. Wordswrorth, however, took the matter calmly, as was his way, and in time the gust blew over. Landor never ceased to regard the King of the Lakists as a great poet, plaguied indeed, by an occasional demon of triviality and dulness, and both in Latin and English, while his feelings of respect for him were at their height, he paid him some generous tributes. Shelley and Landor never met. They were once in Pisa together, but Landor, fired by what he had heard of Shelley's behaviour towards his first wife, refused to call upon him. Later on he regretted the harsh judgment which had kept them apart, went out of his way to place on record his regret for his own loss, and his final high estimate of Shelley's character and gifts. That he should have ranked him as a poet below Southey, while calling him "" incomparably the most elegant, graeoful, and harmonious of the prose-writers,"" only shows that Landor's critical instinct was surest within the domain where he himself excelled. Tcwards Bvron, the arch-romanticist, Landor, the arch-classic of his time, seems to have had a sort of natural antipathy. In one of the "" Imaginary Conversations,"" Southey's friend revenged him for the "" Vision of Judgment "" by a sketch of Byron under the guise of Mr. George Nelly, Lord Rochester's illegitimate son :_
*Whenevar he wrote a bad poem he supported his sinking fame by some signal act of prohigacy-an elegy by a seduction, an heroic by an adultery, a txagedy by a divorce. On the remark of a learned moan that irregularity is no indication of genius, he began to lose ground rapidly, when on a sudden he cried out at the Haymarket, * There is no God.' It was then surmised more generally and more gravely that there nvas something in him, and he stood upon his legs almost to the last. 'Say what you will,' once whispered a friend of mine, there are things in him strong as poison and original as sin.' ""
But with regard to Byron, too, Landor had his regrets when regrets availed nothing; Byron's death in the cause of Gree-e touched and changed the whole current of his feeling, and in the second edition of the dialogue quoted above, Landor added to it a pathetic note expressing his softened mood.-
"" if, before the dialogue was printed be had performed those services to Greece which will renaer his name illustrious to eternity, those by which he merited sulch funereal honours, as, in the parsimony of praise, knowing its value In republics, she hardly would have decreed to tho most deserving of her heroes-never would I, from whatever provocation, have writtenasyllable against him. Oh I
iatIsould have clasped his hand before he died only to makie him more enamoured of his ow 'virtues, ,ndI to keep him with them always.""
For his younger contemporaries-for Mr.Browniug, with whose massive and profound genius the author of "" Count Julian ' felt a close and natural affinity, for Mr. Tennyson, and for Mr. Swinburne, whose visit to him shortly before his death at Florence was one of the Iast pleasures of his life, Landor was the most genial of friends and critics. ""IIis talkc"" says Mr. Colvin, "" was not only incomparably rich and full,it was delivered with such a courtly charm of manner and address, each a rotundity, mellowness, and old-world grace of utterance, as were irresistible."" The mero range of his literary and political memories made him such company as fewv men have the chance of being. In 1864, it was like listening to a voico from another world to hear Lander talk familiarly of Fox and Pitt, of the persons and events of the French Revolution, or of his childish recollections of the AmericanWar of Independence. This longspan of life MLr. Colvin divides into three distinct periods of literary activity, of 26, 16, and again 26 years respectively, the first marked by ""Gebir,"" "" Count Julian, ""and someof bi-sbestLatinverse; the second by all his finest work, such as the "" Imaginary Conversations,"" ""Periclesand Aspasia,"" the ""Examination of Shakespeare,"" and the ""Pentameron""; and the third by a mass of miscellaneous productions, mostly poetical. Landor himself considered his poetry more amateuring compared with his prose, and the estimate is no doubt on the whole perfectly just. After making every allowance for his lack of argumentative power, for his obscurity, for his Latinisms, and for the intermittent character of his dramatic sense,which will bo at its keenest in one page and desert him in the next, Landor's prose, if it continues to be read at all, must always rank with the bestin the English language; whereas his poetry, with the exception of a few pieces of first-rate quality, so few they might almost be counted on the fingers of one hand, is, as a whole, nowhere near the first rank. But how beautiful are these rare exceptions. One knows not who else could have written them. ""Rose Aylmer,"" with its haunting melody; "" Artemidora, ""with its chastened tenderness; the exquisite flowerpassage in the "" Foesalan Idyll,"" the famous shell simile, and two or three more-these surely, if nothing else, must keep Landor's poetical memory green so long as poetry is loved. For examples of his prose Mr. Colvin has naturally drawn almost entirely from the ""Imaginary Conversations,"" giving one or two of what he calls the dramatic conversations in full, and gathering detached aphorisms and sentences from the reflective and expository group. On the whole, the examples are well chosen, though sometimes the shorter extracts are too much cut down to be quite inteligible, and there are one or two dialogues which hardly justify their distinction from the mass of their fellows, especially the weak and characterless dialogue between Essex and Spenser, and the poor one between Fra Lippo Lippi and the Pope.
In the preface to the ""3elections"" Mr.Colvin has tried to satisfy his own mind and his readers' as to the causes of Landor's sca.nty popularity, and the definitions he gives, in the course of his investigations, of the classical and romantio temaxers are just and subtle. That. Landor was
a classio stranded in a romantic ago; that he cultivated the art of bare strength in expression, while others were ransacking heaven and earth to find adornment for the many-coloured garment of their muse, that he deliberately denied himself means of poetical expression which every other modern poet has squandered-hero lies the common explanation of his want of success, and no one could put them better or more freshly than Mr. Colvin. But the causo really goes deeper. Modern romanticism, with its boundless curiosity, its determination to feal all, to represent all, is but one aspect of the scicntific spirit which has been the great birth of our timne. From it, as a French critic justly says, "" has been born the critical spirit af our learned and complicated nineteenth century."" The medinvalists of Scott's day, strange as it may sound, were "" the pioneers of an age of exegesis and of documents."" .Phey were really the iiuxleys and Darwins of literature, for they were the leaders of literary experiment. And becaulse their work was in harmony with the great current of the time,it has been fruitfuland effective. Bunt Landor throughout his life was absolutely untouched by the scientific temper. In no one department was his knowledge of the type which the modern world respects ; and in poetry, instead of throwing himself boldly on to the great stream of speculation and ecperimentwhichfloated o many of hs contemporaries into the harbour of enduring suc^ess, he preferred to practise tours de force in a corner of still water, out of the common course, aud where the world generally found itself too busy to look in upon him. B:a7t, at rhe same time, if he was radically out of sympathy with his age, his facultv of literary expression, within the limits he chose for himself, was unrivalled. For all those who look upon writing itself as a fine art, Mr. Colvin has done a true service by this pair of well-plannad and wellexecuted volumes.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS167953443/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=231f6320
Null,Adam Of St. Victor.*,The Times,1882-Oct-10,"London, England","ADAM Op Sr. V.CTOB.* I,
The reprint in three handy volumes of 1. Gautier's excellent edition of Adam of St. Victor's sequences will be welcomed by studonts of the Latin poetry of the middlo ages. Up to a recent date the farne of Adam, one of the most prolifio monkish poetst rested upon, a comparatively slender basis Off tho. 106 sequences published in the present work, only 37 wore given to tho world with the autbor's name b) Clichtovous in his ""Elucidatorium Ecclesiasticum2,which passed through sev3ral editions from 1515 to 1556; others appeared anonymously iu various collections, but the bulk remained for centuries buried in the library of the Abbey of St. Victor. In the poot's time that abbey stood in tho auburbs of Paris, but was afterwards included within the walls of the growin city. During the French RIvolution,itsharel
the fate of other monastic institutions Its members wero dispersed and its precious manuscripts-Adam's sequences among the number= removed to the National Library in the Louvr, where 1..Gautier.discovered them many yearslater. The author's life i8 all but a perfect blank, whidh even the unwearying research of the French scholar has not beon able to fill up. All that is known of Adam is that he entered the monastery of St. Victor about 1130 as a young man, and was still alive in 1172, M. Gautier fixing the 'date of his death conjeoturally about 1192, At St. Victor he wrote his numerous poems for the great festivals of the Christian year and for the days of the saints and martyrs wilose sacred deeds and miraculous powers are recorded in his verse. As to bis nationality various ocinions ar 4ntnrter;nA Tl'hA
manuscripts call him 4"" Brito,"" wbich may indicate a nativo either of Brittany or England. French writers would naturally be inclined to claim the poet as their countryman,and Archbishop Trencha great adniirer of Adam-concedes the point; without sufficient reason, we think. For ""' tho fact,"" cited by him, '"" that France was the main seat of Latin poetry in the 12th century, aud that all the most f mons composers in this kind were Frenohmen,"" proves absolutely nothiug, seing that many of the monks of St. Victor were notoriously foreigners, who would naturally adopt the style of poetry practised there. On the other an intrinsic proof of Adam's English birth might be discovered in his extreme fondness for alliteration, a device all but unknown in the Romance langu9ges,while it wvas the very backbotie of the metrical principle in Anglo-Saxon poetry, long before rhyme was thought of. We do not attach much force to this argument, but in a question where all is doubtful, it may appear worth mentioning as a piece of collateral evidence.
In discussing the merits of bis original, Mr. Wrangham's critical judgment is obviously impaired by the predilection whch biographers generally, and very natorally, have for their heroes. He speaks of Adam of Ss. Victor as "" perhaps the noblnst mediseral classio we pcsoss, ' and looks upon the mnonstrous statement of Dr. Neale that the monkish versilier is "" to my mind the greatest Latin poet, not only of medoieval, but of all a es,"" as "" an almost pardonable exaggeration.' He even thinks it necessary to quote the equally absurd phras3 of another writer, accordiig to which Adam is the "" Schiller of the MIiddle Ages."" A more meaningless parallelism has never been invented. -There is in the naediaval poetnot a trace of Sobiller's dramatic pathos, or of his force and grandeur of diction. Adam is, in the first instance, a ouphuist, addicted to all manner of verbal and metrical artificialities and not adverse to a downright pun. "" Sub securi stat securus,"" ho says of one martyr, and is anxious to derive the name of his favourite saint Agnes from the "" agius Dei."" These mannerisms are, of course, not peculiar to him alone. Medaimval poets areveryfond of turning etymological affinities to religious account, and it is probable that the Virgin Mary owes the attribute "" maris stella "" quito as mu.h to an accidental similarity of name as to the fact that iri the mythology of the Roman Church she superseded the ideal of antigue womanhood, the sea-born goddess Aphrodite. Bat Adam of St. Victor goes far beyond his compeers in his passion for verbal qufbbles and subtleties of vers3, and it is, perhaps, owing to this circumstance that even in his own age he distinctly occupied theposition of a literary poet. There is nothing mn his work of the intense pathos or the human feeling which, in spite of the learned idiom, appealed to the hearts of the people in such sutblime efforts as the ""l Iies iri,"" the Ambrosian hymn 4' To Deum laudamus,"" or Jacopone's '""Stabat Mater."" The tendemess of that sweetest of lullabies-
""Dorrii fti, dormi ! mater
"" Cantat unigensto,""
and the triumphant confidence of that l:ean of the Christian faith, Venantius Fortunatus ""Vexilla regis prodeunt,"" are aliko unknown to himn Neithler has he passed through the terrors of the valley of the shadow of death which inspired the grand "" antiphona de morte "" "" Media vita, in morto swnus, ' written, it is said, by Notker after he had seen workmen who were building a bridge suspended over a terrible precipice. The strength of Adam of St. Victor lies elsewhere, He is a scl%olarlI poet, a competent cr. ftsman who wields his tools with skill, is fastidious in the choice of his epithets, and tells a story neatly and succinctly. His legend of St. Agnes, the sainted maiden who at the age of 13 prefers martyrdom to we:lth and luxury and love, is an excellent specimen of narrative poetry as practised in the middlo ages. His proficiency as a story-teller as well as tie variety of his motres, which has been a sore trial to Mr. XYrangham's skill as a translator, Adam to some extent derived from a source little suspected by his reverend critics. It was during his lifetime that the trouweres of Northern France founded a national epic upon the legends of the Arthurian and Carlovingian cycles, while at the same time the lyrical poets of the South developed a system of metrical art unrivaled for subtlety and variety by Dante himself. From that system Adam seems to have takeu more than one valuable suggestion, and there are in his poems distinct traces, for instan2e, of the grammatical, or, as it is technically caUed, the "" dictional "" rhyme and other subtleties familiar to the student of that vast compendium of metrical lore, the Leis d'amors.
Into further techni^al details, interesting as they would be to the stude ut, we cannot for obvious reasons enter hore. It is enough to say, that as a connecting link between sacred and profane poetry in the middle ages the sequences of Adam of St. Victor gain all importance not hitherto roalized by any writer on the subject. It is but fair to add that Mr. Wrangham's translation has beon executed with care and skill, the metres of the original having been strictly adhered to. The faithful randering of one of Adam's elaborate stanzas from a poem on the Nativity may be quoted by wvay of specimen

Null,"The Works Of Alexander Pope,*",The Times,1882-Jan-27,"London, England","| THE WORKS O ALBXANDER POPS,* I~~~~~~~~~~OE .I.
Tho literary history of England for noarly a century3ndahalf contres round threo personalities,each in hiS day tho focus of all that was said or written, that was either wise or witty. He who knows minutolY tho livos of Dryden, of Pope, andof Dr. Johnson, with their sayinga and doings, their friendships, and their enmities, ksiows intimately the courso of English letters, and poetry, from tho Restoration to tho FronchRevolution. This is not because any one of the three men has any claim to be considered either the greatest intellect or tho noblest mind of his age. All the three had cotemporaries moro illustrious, and more considerable, either in literary genius, or in reaeh of philosophical idea. Dryden was cotemporary with Newton and with Locke; Popo has no protensions to the genius of Bolingbroke, or tho force of Swift, or the philosophy of Butler; Johnson cannot compare in regard of the highest and most prized mental qualities with Hume, or Adam Smith, with Burke or GSibbon. But whatever their inferiority in the more splendid gifts of intellect, each of these threo mon-Dryden, Pope, and johnson-is a representative man of his age. Each gathered round himself, either attracting or repelling, the circulating atoms of thought, feeling, passion, and preoudice, vwhich were floating in the social atmosphere of his time. In a greater dogree, and in a more poculiar mannor is this true of Pope. Mr. Matthew Arnold has lately pronounced against the "" historic estimate "" in the study of poetry. There are no doubt pooms which may be taken wholly apart from their socular surroundin s, and viewed absolutely, as works of art. ltr. Arnold's doctrine, howevor, wil uot cover the case of Pope anv more than that of Dante. Tho pootry of Pope is the mirror of his age, and the most completo representation which wo have of social life in the early years of Georgo II. It may be doubted, indeed, if we know any period so well and so distinctly as we do this. For hero we know not merely the facts, but tho sontiments and passions, the hates and fears, which attach to and animate the filats. And this insight is gained chiefly through Pope-his poems not his letters-chiefly from his own verses, but partly also from the illustration wbich has been gathered round his verses by generation aftor generation of scholiasts. To feel the importance of Pope's poetry as the mirror of his age, we havo only to reflect what an eclipse would come over the London of 1720-40, if Pope's poems, with the commentaries adhering to them, should be suddenly obliterated. The memoirs of LordaHervey, the letters of Horace Walpole, and in a subordinate degree, those of Lady Mary Wortley Montague, are each of them precious cotemporary records. But all the three taken together could not replace for us the illumination shed upon every object which fell waithin its ken, by the verse of Pope in his satires and epistles, and moral essays.
It is these pieces which form the contepts of the volumo of Pope's works, the third volume of the poetry, and the first under Mr. Courthope's editorship, now given to the public. Theso pieces are vithout question the most valuable of all that Pope has left us. In his own day, and for a generation after it, the "" Essay on Manu "" was regarded as Pope's capital work. But in spito of occasional brilliant passa es in the essay, various causes have combined to sholve that poem for us in our day. It is not merely that optimism is out of fashion, and that the moral pendulum has swung in the opposite directien but that even granting tho truth of Pope's thesis-viz., that whatever is, is right-wo have becomo too consoious of his feebleness, and incompotence, to handlo that or any philosophical pioblem. Popo's versifiled rendering of Shaftesbury and Bolingbroke had a triumphant success in his day, owing to the striking illustrations, pithy sayings, and the brilliant passages, with which Pope's skill could dress out an argument. We live in an age of "" Essays,"" and know, only too well, what a show an extemporizing philosopher, whose stucdies have been limited to magazines, can make, with his hastily got-up information. Pope, in the ""Essay on Man,"" was just like one of tho prophets of our own day. Eithor conversing with Bolingbroke, or dipping into Shaftesbury's charactoristics, his quick perception seized the general drift of that philosophic theory, whichflfoated loosely in the air of London, and he prosenteo it to tho reader with a literary finish acquired by 25 years study of the art of polish. Tho applause of his cotemporaries rewarded him for his labour, and disguised from himself the fact, which is patont to us, that his selection of a philosphical subject was a mistako.
But though amid tho chorus of applause which grected the ""Essay on Man "" it was impossible for its author to know how worthless itsphilosophy would soon seem, that instinct which guides goniuis soon detormined bim in the right direction. The occasion of his trying his hand on the ""Imitations of Horace,"" might be, as he told Sponce accidental
"" When I had a fever one winter in towvn, that confned me to ry room for fivo or six days, Lord ]Bolingbroke, who came to see me happened to take up a Horace that lay on the tablo, ana on turning it over dropped on the frst satiro of the second book. IIe observed how woU that would suit my case if I were to imitato it in English. After he was gone I read it over, translated it in a morning or two, and sent it to press.""
This casual suggestion of Bolingbroke mado in 1732 could do no more than reinforce the sense, which might long before have been coming to Pope, of tho true direction in which his strength lay-that, namely, of personalities, and living portraiture. Discerning friends had seen this long before. As early as 1722, Atterbury, who had seen the famous lines upon Addison, wrote to Pope, "" Since you now know in what direction your strength lies, I hopo you will not suffer that talent to bo unemployed."" Though the first of tho "" Imitations of Horace"" did not appear till 1733, yet during the interval Pope was composing trenchant satire, in bitc and couplets, which wero afterwards piecod together to form whabt is now called the "" Prologue to the Satires.1' It is no paradox to say that his ': Imitations of Horace "" aro tho imost original of his works, as they are to us, by reason of their contents, the most valuable. These "" Imitations,"" eight in number, make, with the ""Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot"" and tho two "" Epilogues,"" a body of verso the most sparkling, lively, and poignant that our own or any modern language has to show. They aro not throughout -no poetry is or can be-of equal vigour. A superior critic can point to many a feeble line, to somo even bad lines, to defective grammar, and strained parallels; but, in spite of blemishes, the canvas, as a whole, is animated by a glow of life, and light, and reality such as we may seek for in vain in othor pictures of tho manners of contemporaries. An uneqnaleod master of expression, he
has preserved the Iife of the past for us in a state of suspended animation. ""Popo,"" as Mr. Ruskinhassaid, ""is the most perfect representative we have since Chaucer of the true English mind.""
Mr. Ruskin's hint of the resemblance between Pope and Chaucer suggests to us at tho same time tho difference botween tho two poots. And the comparison, whether by way of Vw ness or unlikeness, is equaUy helpful towards tho understauding of Pope. Both the "" Canterbury Tales "" and Pope's 4 Satires "" are a presentment of tho living soIeity by which oach poot found himself surrounded. But in Chaucer, as in Molibre, the portraiture is generic. He draws for us classes of men, not individual lin;onesses. In Pope, on tho other hand, everything is personal and individual. Whenever Pope attompts to generalize, whether it be truth or character,he immediately falls below himself. As tho theodicy of tho "" Essay on Man,"" tbhe attempt to ""v indicate tho ways of God,"" seems to us now puerilo, so the moralizing of the "" Moral Essays ' reads trito and common-laleo. His reflections and his maxims are now consignad to the copy-book. But as tho feeblo philosophizing of tho "" l say on Man "" was and is redeemed by tho brilliant colouring of the illustrations and tho sparkle of the epigram whieh enforced it, so in tho ""M Ioral Essayse and "" Satires"" we regard the platitudes of bis moral theory morely as tho mortar and cement which hold togother the miseollaneous characters of living men and women in someosort of whole. When Popoetells us to search the ruling passion, for "" thoro alone the wild are constant,andthe cunning known,"" wo nover think of following tho direction,or of taking thoewords for anything more than the obligatory preamblo to the piquant character of the Dukoe of Wharton which this maxim, so poromptorily announced, intro:luces. It is just here teat the critical finger can point out the proeise limit of Pope's power. He could not rise from thoepar-
* ""Tho Worlis of Alexander Pope."" loew edition, 'with ,introduetion and notes by tho Rev. Whitwotth Elwsn and WYillism Jwn CouKhoDx VOL IIL Munoz. lSSL
ticular to tho ge0 eral. Be was always endeavouring to do so, nnd always with one result-a fall into the occah of platitude. His imagination could not, as Chaucer's did, create porso)nage after personage, each embodying a type, and at the samo time endowed with tho porsonal identity of
nman or woman whom Weo have or might have known. Pope's portraits are real, not because they aTe the embodimente of a vivid imagination , but because they are tho lino observation of a lynx-oyed observer of the fasults and foibles of
polwhom he actually kmnov. Tlius, theo value of his ""Essays"" and ""Satnires""to unsis thoir storical value. Other essayists and versiliers may have given us the manners of the time. Pope'sversi goes benoath the mere manners, and expresses thE passions, feelings, thonghts, and motives of ar atistocracy which, after a period of fierce religiow war, htd come into quiet possossion of undisputed authority in all that concerned social life, morals, taste, and breeding. The fuirious Parliamentary battles of the timo, and the beat vith which Walpole was assailed, should not cisguise from us the fact that tho great religious struggle of tho preceding century had (for a time) died down, and given place to a mere dynastic division of Whig and Tory. The Government was actually in the hands of the Whigs ; it was resisted and reviled by the Tory and Jacobite Opposition. But, regarded from a distance, -inimsters and their antagonists together formed a homogeneous aristocracy, having in common the ideas, sentiments, and qualities which constituted the civilized England of tbh Hanoverian age. In Pope'e ""Satires ""we find a bright re'flection of these men and their way6:-
""E e shows us the rise of woman as a controlling power in secicty and politics- the extension among the niobilty of an Italian taste in paintinz andl architecture the hatred felt by the Catholics for tthe moneyed middle class, whvich was the backbone of the Revolution, the mnainstay of Whiggery, and tho bulwark of Protestantism. in his satires, too, *ve seo a mirror of the feelings of the Parliamentary Opposition directed by Bolingbroke and Pulteney; of their rancour apsinst walpole's foreign and domestic policy; ot the relations between tho Uourt and the arty of the Prince of WVales; of the popular dislike of the oanoverian dynasty and of Low Churh principles Besides, we have suggestive glimpses of the pnterior of society at a time when St. James's was the extreme West. end of London, and old Burlington-houso was but just built. The ' British youth ' appear at their diversions at White's Chocolate-house, llocly-in-tho-Hole, or Fig's Academy. Complaints aro heard trom polite society of the degradation of tho stagc in consequence of the public passion for spectacles. I'be penniless ' man of rhyme walks forth ' froma the Mint, and tho dealiogs of tho illodged bard of Drury-lane with his aristecrati: or commercial patrans are exposed in the full light of pitiless ridicule. As wo read the society of the past rises hefore the imagination in its dramatic reality. The age in many respects may have had the defects of its poet, but, like huim, it was not without generous qualities ; it is, at least, fuU of human and historical interest, whether it be regarded as the period when the British Empire first began to rise, or as the aristocratic stage of English society, in which the realities of charactcr displayed themselves with a frankness wanting in our own democratic tines, when the individual is apt to disguise his natural imputses in deference to publio opinion.""
It 1o0uows Irom this that such poetry as that of Pope stands much iu need of a commentator. So lifelike, indeed, aro his pictures that they never fail to impress even readers who are wvithout any knowvledge; but our appreciation and enjoymont of Popo rises in proportion as our independent acquaintance with history and biography is anlarged. It is the first business of an editor of Popo to explain the allusions, to fill up the blanks, to ferret out tho now obscure facts, and to explain the poet's personal reoations to the various objects of his love or his censure. In all satiro, from tho very nature of tho case, thero is an obscurity of personal allusiou ; but' this becomes almost desperate in Pope, owing to the tortuous ways of the man, who at once wanted to bo understood and feared to be. He would havo beeu sorry that it should not have been supposed that Timon meant tho Duke of Ohandos but ho did not reaUy mean him; he quite intonded somebody else, as he could say both to tho Duke and to himsolf with the honesty of that completest self-deception which at last overtakes the habitually disingenuous mind. Even while the ink of his satire was wet, it required the accompaniment of a running commentary. Swift writes to Pope in 1728:-
|"" The notes (to 'The Dunciad') Icould wish to be large in what rolates to tbo persous concerned, for I havo observed that 20 miles from London nobody understands hints, initial letters, or town facts and passages. 1 insist you must have yoer asterisks fllcd up with the real names.""
If a contemporary, an intimate friend of the author, and living in the same circle of acquaintance, as Swift was, found much that he did not understand, how much more must a reador a century and a half later require the helping hand of an annotator.
And somo measure of such holp has not been wanting from the very first. Popo put footnotes to his pooms himself ; but his notes, so far from being explanatory, aro ofton only designed for mnystification. Heo seeks to guard bimself by voil. ing the aim of the tex-t, where it is at all direct, under ironical p raise in the note. But Pope enjoyed the sinwlar distinction of living to see at least one of his works furnished 'with a regular commentary aftor the mannor of n classic. In our day we have societies formod for the study and illustration of the works of living writers ; but in tho history of literaturo the instances are extremely few in which a living poet has attracted a commentator to his sido. OnO such instance is found in Selden's notes to Drayton's "" Polyolbion,"" perhaps the most learned commentary on any book in the English language. The object of Warburton's commonton the ""Essay onMhan"" was notexplanation, but Apology. The natural theology of the "" Essay on Mau "" was neither better nor worse reasoned that were any of the thoistio treatises of the day. But it bad naturally attracted more attention and roused the zeal of the professional answerers moro than they. A heavy Swiss professor, Jean Pierre Crousaz, had levelled a ponderoas volume, which had been immediately translated into English, against the "" Essay. "" Pope was in dire alarm. It was not that he cared for the imputation of free-thinking, which attached to many of his best friends, and e3pecialy his,"" guide,"" Bolingbrok-e; but what Popo above all dreaded was unpopularity, from whatover cause. He was in this respect the opposito of Thoophilo Gautior, who took a mischievous pleasure in running countor to the public and tho fashion and affecting to address himself to the feIw. Pope, indeed, is constantly talking as if he wero a Gautiar. When Pope protends that his only ambition is to
""Maintain a poet's dignity and eC3e,
And seo what friends and rcAi what books I please; ""To sleep witbout a poem in my head,
""2Nor know if Denais bo alivo or dead.""
we ail know this is only the author's mockmodesty, and that Pope is playing with us his little innocent farceo of hido-and-seok. In any one else such affectation would be allowed to pass with a smilo at its transparency. But tho editors and critics of Popo seem to be all men of such exceptionally fine morality tbat they cannot over. look such a want of uprightncss,and Pope is always on these occasions branded as a hsrdened liar. His pretonceo of not caring for public opinion really conceals the most acute sensitiveness to the son populi, and when tho storm of orthodox reprobation set in against the "" Essay on Man "" Pope mIust have be 7un to think in what shape he could retract or disavow the Deism imputed to that poem.

This was whilo Warburton consorted with literary hacks of the lower stratum -Concainen, Thcobald, and other "" Dunces."" But Warburton was bent upon rising, and in this Crousaz businoss ho saw his opportunity. Ho suddenly transferred his advocacy to Pope's side. Tho ""Ei:ssay on Man "" at onceo ceased to be made up of ""the worst passages from the worst authors,"" and heavy monaces wero uttered, Bishop Law tolls us, against any one who should prosume to insinuato that Popo borrowed anythig from any man whatsoever, instoad of "" rank atheism "" the poem now breathed pity and sound pbilosophy in every line.

to whom was addressed the epistle on the "" Oha_ racters of Women."" Warburton, who at one time saw a good deal of Pope, mioht have done much towards tha proper business -of an editor. When the meaning was obscure he could always have sought its explanation at the fountain-head. He has told us some-very few-facts about Pope which we should not otherwise have known. But his discharge of the duty of general editor of the works was marked by uuscrupulous disregard of the interests of the dead author and a design to make the edition subservient to his own promotion in tho Church. When Pope made his will he expected Warburton to be as eager to upbold his poetical credit with the public as he7ad been when he championed the "" 1assay on Alan."" But the Warburton of 1751 was a different man from the Warburton of 20 years before. Then he had been a struggling and obscure author; he was now on the way to the highest dignities of the Church. Instead of defending his author's position and attaching himself to his cause, he inserted at intervals at the foot of thepage, dpropos of nothing, an unmeaning panegyric. 'The personal allusions he endeavoured to slur over by assuming an air of arrogant superiority. There is a passage in Pope's "" Satires and Epistles,"" 4, 85, which has been the cruxc of all the commentators and is still unexplained:-
I Ris wealtl bra,e Timon gloriously confounds; A-sked for a groat, he gives a hundred pounds, ""Or if three ladies like s luckless play,
*Takes the whole house upon the poet's day.""
Who is Timon? Who the ""three ladies ""? And whose play?? Warburton's note is characteristic of the man and .of the edition:-
""1 The common reader, I am sensible, will bo always mnore soUcitous.about the uanaes of these three ladies, the unlucky play, and every other trifling circuinstace that attended this piece or gallantry, than for the explanation of our author's sense or the illustration of his poetry. Bub hsd it beea M1r. Pope's purpose to indulge so impertinent a curiosity be had sougbt elsewhere for a commentator on his writings.""
In a hypocritical "" advertisement "" prefixed to his edition, Warburton pomnpously informs the reader that by his advice and suggestion Pope finally altered his poetry so as to adapt it to promote "" the ends of virtue and religion."" AVarburton was suspected by Croker of having tampered with tho text of the "" Satires."" The more carefui investigations of Mr. Elwin have disproved this suspicion. But no credit redounds to Warburton for his fidelity to the poet's own text ; for he was bound by the terms of Pope's will, tnder penalty of forfeiture of his legacy, to print what Pope leftwithout alteration.
Warburton was so established in his legal and testamentary rights as proprietor of Pope that it has not been possible from 1761 to the present flay to have Pope without having him thus strangled by his Old Man of the Sea. Dr. Aitkin long since complained that "" it is scarce possible in many places to enter into the poet's real meaning without laying aside the Commentary."" Every one complained,but no one dared the innovation of discardina Warburton. Even Mr. Elwin, in the present edttiou, feared the charge of incompletenes*, and reprinted the whole of Warburton's Commentary on the "" Essay,"" though removing it from the foot of the naze to an annendix.
Of the editors wioi succeeded Warburton our spaceforbidsustogive an account. Each contributed something--Roscoe the least, Warton the most. Joseph WVarton had a cultivated classical taste and a scholar's knowledge at least of the Latin poets. Warton had besides the advantage of being ablo to consult living _persons who had known Pope, 3specially Lord Batburst and Dr. Spence. Scattered about in Warton's notes are many precious original memoranda or anecdotes. We have said that Roscoe contributed the least of all Pope's editors to the elucidation of his author. It would be probably safe to say that he contributed nothing. Roscoe's reading lay in the Italian writers of the Renaissance ; oE tbe 18th century he knew nothing. Mr. Adolphus Ward says, "" Roscoe has shown that Bufo was not meant for Lord Halifax. "" No allusion in aUl ""Pope's Satires "" is of more assured interpretation than the Bufo of the ""Prologue of the Satires."" Roscoe'sdenialthat Lord Halifax wvas intended is a testiniginstance of hisqualifications as an interpreterofPope.The public and the booksellers,however, f oundthat style of e
ing good enough. Two editions of Roscoe's Pope have been placed upon the market at a bigh price.
Editors of English classics are now tried by a higher standardthin that which was usual 5Oyears ago. The present Elwin-Courthope edition is a very different work from the old style of "" trade "" edition hastily got up to order. Mr. Elwin bad made it 'lifficult to find a successor for himself, such had been the exhaustive patience with which he had worked his way tbrough the overwhelminmass of detail wbich had gathered round Popo ana all his works. But Mr. Courthope has not shrunk from repeating the process of laborious research which is necessary before any single affirmation can safely be made as to what Pope did, meant, or intended. And in the tone aaopted towards the author the present editor approaches more nearly to judicial impartiality than did his predecessor. Mr. Elwinlay on Pope's scent something like the huntsman's terrier following the hunted fox through the windings of his last refuge in the sarth. In Mr. Courthope's introduction to the present volume tbhere is muoh less of the public prosecutor, with a full recognition of the duty of in editor to explain. And if Pope's editors are inevitably driven to approach their work in the spirit of literary detectives it is owing to Pope's own mystifications and underground proceedings. Perhaps, indeed, the time has hardly yet arrived for the definitive edition of Pope's poems. When the tortuous labyrinth of intrigue in which his various publications are enveloped has once for all been fully unraveUled, there will bo no need for each successive editor to essay his skiU in disentangling the maze of error. The whole subject, indeed, may well be banished from the scholar's edition of Pope as unprofitable and not properly belonging to literature. It may even be made a question if critical estimates ought to find place in a perfect edition of any poet. There are some excellent remarks in Mr. Courthope's introduction on Pope's stvle, but thrown as they are into a controversial form, being an answer to Mr. Leslie Stephen, they may, perhaps, be thought more appropriate to a reviewv or an independnt essay than to an edition.
The proper business of an editor of Pope-tbat of explaining dificulties and recalling vwhat is known of forgotten personages -is performed by Mr. Courthope with exemplary diligence. It is slways a matter of doubt whether explanatory notes should be foot notes or should be placed together at the end of the text. There can be n doubt whatever as to the rule that when it has been decided to place the notes at the foot of the page condensation and brevity should be studied as much as possible. This cannot be attained on the variorum plan adopted in the present volume, the plan, that is, on which the notes of previous editors are introduced in their own words. When a vaiiorum commentary becomes itself entertainingreading, and many of them are such, it becomes a substantive work and should be kept apart froni the original text. The footnote annotator should keep hinself and his apparatus out of sight and allow the reader's interest to settle exclusively on the text.
Mr. Courthope says that of the obscurities of personal allusion in Pope much must now be regarded as beyond the reach of explanation and much must remain mere conjecture. We may justly congratulate him upon having left so little unexplained. In. the couplet:-
"" Eve's tempter thus the Rabbins have expressed, ""' A cherub's face, a reptile all the rest.""
aope is certainly referring to some piece of Rab-. bimcal lore which he had seen in some book, but no one has yet been able to produce the passage:-
""A pension or such harness fir a slave
Ans Bug now bas and Dorimant would have.""
Mr. Courthope has now placed it beyond a doubt that the first pseudonym here stands for the Duke of Kent. But the same evidence seems to confirm Bennet's conjecture that the liue:-
_ Far other stars than * and * * wear,""
in "".pilogue IL,"" 238, should be filledup wvith the oames Kent and Grafton rather than with those of George and Frederick as prooosed by Lord -Marchmont. Ne are still unable fo discover the motive of the line:-
""Outdo Llandaff in doctrine-yes, ia life,""
reinforced as the innuendo is by Pope's own note, "" A poor bishopric in Wales as poorly upplied."" Mr. Elw3;in's transcript of the Chauncy MS. has 'made it certain that Dr. Harris was the prelate in. tended, but how Harris had offended Pope remains 'for future editors to discover.

the editor usefully reminds us that Soho is here not used for the square which was still fasbionable, but for Wardour-street,wbich was originally called Old Soho, and had already begun to acquire a connexion with old curiosities.

Null,Virgil.*,The Times,1877-May-28,"London, England","VIRfHL.*
Professor Sell:r has Ifolowved up Iiis volulue on Lucretius, published about 12 years ago, by au equally exiaustive and interesting work on tha position and poetry of Virgil. We cannot undertake to foUow lhim through all the departments of his subject, though all are sufficiently popular for the taste of the general public, to whom, accoidingly, wve healtily commend theim. But the porsonal history of Yirgil, hi3 position amongthe poets of the world, and his three great works-the Edogu.s, the Georgics, aund the &neid-supply more th:.n enough material for the space wve have at our commantid.
Virgil wvas born on the 15th of October, t0 years before the birth of Chrlist, at Andes, a village on the iiincio, aiid in the neighbourhood of tile town of ANIantua. Modern research has failed to verify the exact site of his birthplace; but Mr. Sellar gives the preference to a spot about 15 milts higher up the river than Mautua, wMhich -ilusely corresponds with a passage in tie nilnthEclogue. lie says -' 'Jhe only nli ls in the ne.ghmbourhood of the Tvineo to which these lines can apply ara those which for a timte accormpany the flow of the river from the foot of tnte Lago di Garda, and gradually sink into tiLe plaitu a litiL beyond - the picturesque hill and castl. ot Vallegto,' abojut 15 miiiles higher up thie river thau iManrtua."" Vir, or Ver, is thoughit to be a C/Itic root, and it is supposed accordingly that the poet had Celtic blood in his veins, whica may aucount for his '- vaue sLnse of melancholy"" anl sevelal other chamacteristics, imaginative and romantic, tolt consonrant with the tirmer ternue a- iuent of the old ataiun race."" V irgil's father was one of the e(ld lace of yeomen, a Iemniant of wvhom had survived the civil wars, and he also held a small otEcc uudi-r the local 'raetor. Virgil, it is said, xvvs born wvith suci a swveet expr.4sion of counteniance tbat a nlore than ordinary happy life wits piredicted f(r him, and for once such a prediction wras rezlizvd. His father nvas one, wvhlo like Horace's, app:eciated the use of education, Lnd determijued to give his son the best tijat was within his reach. He was at echool first of all at Cremona, and afterwards at Milan, iind cane to Rome to coMplete his Lducation at the age of sixteen. 13oth ne and Augustus, then only twelve years old, were pupils of thle se.uie tutor, lp dius, aiud an inmtimacv may then Itave been forrmeu destinied to exercise all important influence on the future fortunes of the poet. W hen his course of study was completed he seems to have returnLd home, and it may be conjectured that lie now lent some assistance to l:s fatber in the managemelnt of his farm, since we knoWv no other p-riod of ILis life when he could have acqluired tl.e practical knowledge of agriculture exhibited in the Georgics. He is said to have failed at ihe Bair, and he seeLms to have not hmally settled dowa to a literary life till 42 B.c., wheni he was twenty-eight years of age. In thatyear he commenced the Eclogues, which he finishtd in B.c. 37, and during the interval occurred I all those circumstances in comruexion with the loss of his es.ate wh.ch aie familiar to us through thtse poems. He uever returned to the ueighbourhood after his second expulsion f row it. lout Augustus took charge of his fortunes, aud henceforth he lived an easy and a happy life, dinded betveen Rome, Naples, and a country house in Campanin. He wrote the Georgics between 37 and 30 B.e., and the 2Eneid hi the next eleven yeais. In 19 B.C. he was taken ill on his return voyage to I:aly, after zravellitng as far as Athelns, and, continuing his journey without intemrission,he became so muuch worse that lie reached Brundisium, only to die there in the olst year of his age. he Iit bebind him a considerable fortune, valued at about £80,000 of our mouey, and, in conformity with lis character as a great literary artist, he desired the ,Eueid to be burnt, because he had been unabla to revise i. Liut, fortunately for posterity, his executors were instructed by the Emperor to disregard this injunction.
The position of Virgil, standing for eighteen centuries on the pinnacle of European literature, is absolutely unique, and -Mr. ;ellar's brief sketch of the unbroken conitinuity of his fime, from the earliest praises of Propertius and Ovid donwn to the Viragiian quotations whichl still linger in the House of Connonis, is not the least interesting of his pages. He was thei model of all lator linuiaii writers. Evea Tacitus was indeb ed to him ; :;t. Augustin anid the Venerable JlLde shoW marked traces of his ilnfluence ; Dante bows downv before him as his utaster. :;caliger ranked Virgil above both Homer and Theccritus ; Voltaile Sa d that if HEomer made Virigil, it was hiFl greatest work ; Burke, wheni engautd at his desk, always '^ had a ragged Delphizi Virgil not far fromi his elbow."" *Ve may say of Vir.gil, if of anything or any one, Securnus judicat orbis terrarum. Virgil's fame, indeed, lias fluctuated, nor is it now what it was formerly. The Virgilian Addison adnmitted bis inferiority to Homer in the delineation of character; end at the end of the 18th century, witb the reactioni which produced the Lake School catae a general depreciation of all which had been long admired: a contempt for form which was supposed to be the antithesis of nature,and a suspicion of elegance as if incompatible with vigour. But the world has been disenciauntLd of many illusions since that time. A return to nature in the senise in which the term was used bv the euthusiasts of the Revolution was found to be as impossible as a return to childhood. 'lfhus, the greatest poet of the present day is once more foiuid in the person of the m ost consummnate and elaborate artist. Virgil is floating back with the tide to his old position in literature. Many causes admirably drawn out by 3Ir. Sellar bave reversed the relative old of himself and Homer. Y'u ivunic eris alter ab illo miust now be m9id of the Latin, not of the Greek poet. But that we appreciate H omer more is no reason for appreciating Virgil less. Comparisons, however, are always cdious, and in his comparison of Virgil with the other great pcets of the world Mr. Sellar himnself gives out a moro uncertain sound than is his wont. Hte sets out by asking a question to which he gives no precise answer.
'lhe difference between the Eclogues of Virgil and the Idylls of 'I heocritus is that in the former the natural, in the latter the human, element predominates. "" 'aheocritus shows everywhere the social temperament of the Greek."" Mfr. Sellar thinks he would never have written the lines-
*- Ibi hbac incondita solus
""Montibua et silvis studio jactabat inani.""
In dramatic power, therefore, 'I heocritus is as superior to Virgil as Virgil is to himi in that sympathy with nature whieh we associate with romantic
ALlUert1 wlLk n WILII cilis51ClS poetry. I lhat this is no fanciful distinction is attested by the evidence of Wordsworth, himself si quis alius a sympathizer with nature, who was a warm admirer of the Eclogues. ""'ihey are,"" he says, "" quite another thing from 'I heocritus, however they niay be based on '1 heocritus ;"" and his remarks on Milton's ""Lycidas"" are equally applicable to Virgil. ""¶' he best defence of ' Lycidas ' is iiot to defend the design of it at all, but to allege that the execution of it is uerfect, the diction of it the ?w plus 'ultra of grace and luveliness, and that the spirit of the whole is as original as if the poem contained no traces of the author's acquaintance with ancier.t pastoral poetry from 'i heocritus dowin-vards."" 'i he Eclogues are redolenit of the love of home and the love of ltaly, and we stronlgly recoummend to our readers MIr. Sellar's final judgment on them, not more as a correct summary of their merits than as a beautiful piece of English writing.
if we l0ek for some leading idea running through each of Virgil's greater works, we shall find, according to 3Ir. Sellar, that, as the idea of the Eclogues is "" the glorification of the dolce far ijiente of Italian life,"" as tlhe idea of the 1Eneid is the glorification of empire, sO, with some modiflcgtions, the idea of the Ueorgics is the glorification of labour, a phrase due in the fitst instanco, we believe, to MJr. MIorivale in his "" History of the Roman Empire,"" buf one which Mr. Sellar seems willing, on tho whole, to adopt. MLr. Sellar warns us himeelf, however, of the daugers of epigrammatic criticism, and, injfact, neither lie nor Nlr. Merivale means that the definition above given is to be received as an exhaustive one. 'I he Georgics are rather the glorification of the old Roman country, life, with all its dom(st c virtues, religious faith, hardihood, and patriutism. ""'1 he re8toration of the old ' coloni' of ltaly and the revival of the great forms of national industry associated with the older and happier memories of Rome had been a leading feature in the policy of the great popular leaders from the Graccihi dowvn to Julius Cmsar,"" and the Georgics were written with the direct purpose of contributing to this restoration. rI he dignity of labour, however, was a Roman idea, not to be found among either the Greeks or the Hebrews, and as such, no doubt, finds a prominence in
Virgil's poem which must have struck -very many scholars and critics befire M1r. Merivale. Virgil, moreover, in describing-tbe incessant toil, vigilance, and fortitude demanded of the husbaudmaii in his long conflict with the hostile forces of nature, no doubt, had before his eyes the qualities which had gone to the formation of the Roman State and had enabled it to subdue the world, as the husbandman subdues the earth.-
"" Tante n3olis erat Romsiam condere gentem.""
Mr. Sellar devotes 60 pages to the influence of Luctetmus on the Georgics, in which he shows how the philosophy of the elder poet was modified by the reverential spirit of the younger. Nature, that iu Lucretius is supreme, supremne over the gods theemselves, and representing auniversal law, is in Virgil the creatiou of the gods, and revealing herself to man rather as a mfinstering agency than as a great majestic power. EHe does Inot regard her in the abstract so distinctly as Lucretius. * 'lhe secret of the power of Lucretius as an interpreter of nature lies in his recognition of the suiblinmity (f natural law in ordinary phenomena. The secret of Vir-il's povwer lies in the insight and longpractised meditation through *which he abstracts the single element of leauty from commnon sights and the ordinary operations of industry."" 'fhis is a good specimen of Mr. Sellar's criticism, aud the whole of the comparison betwe n these tvo great poets is worked out wvith equal elegance and discrimination. finally, we are reminded of the absolute perfection of the whole poeim regarded as a work of ait. "" it is the finest work of italian art, made perfect by the long education of Gr-eek studies. . . . Virgil has created a newer and nobler type, wvhich never has, and probably never will, be improved llpon . . . in rhyzth3nical movement the poem exhibits the highest perfectio-n oi wihich Latin verse is capable.""
We have now, however, to pass awvay from ground on which Virgil's supremacy is unrdisputed to anotner and far dilfeient field, where he is no louger tthe mouarcu of all, but, on the contrary, ihas been paying, in undue depreciation, the penalty of the too great admiration of former times. *- iriend, come down lowver,"" are the ha:d words to which he has been compelled to listen. Yet w*ho but must feel that an immor-tal glory stillsurrounds the Luceid, and that tl.e august ideas of empire, conquest, ann the reign of iaiv have never been enshrined in verse of equal melodv and majesty ? '1he ideas wlhich animate the L ueid are as much superior to the ideas which aninmate tho iliad as the actors in the latter are superior to the actors in the former. Nevertheless, as it is the human element which must take precedence in an epic, Virgil must yield the first place to the Fuater of i'oetry. Virgii, says alr. Sellar, invented a niew form of Elpic poetry. ""'lhe lliad and Odyasey are essentially poems of personal, the LEnerd of national, fortunes."" 'Ils is quite true, and by so much is the Greek superior to the Roman. Yet even the personal interest in the ,Eneia was foir a long time greatly underrated, till fresh vindicatars have re:ently arisen to set Virgil right witii the literary world once more. Among these, foremost, if not first, wvas the late Professor Coningtonl, who has shown us that it is in one sense the strong human synmpathies of Virgil whlch account to .ome extent for tne iuneriority of his poerm.
t)ne t.f the most interesting seutions of 1Mr. Sellar's work is that in which he discusses the delineation of character in VirgiL uneas has a divine nussion wnich raises lhin above the ordinary passions. of humamnity; and faithi in Heaven andL patience to endure all the irials which may attend the fulfilment of its pjurpose are all that is required of him. lie has to oypose au unbending front to the hardships thrown in his way by hi stile deities,
'Et vincere fata ferendo. ""
Such a character must necessarily appear somewhuat tame and colourless, and Air. -ellar illustrates lis meaning mostadmnirably by polinting out that maniy of Sir W alter Scott's heroes, by their superior tolerance and enlighteniment, produce a somewliat similar impression when contrasted ""with the more animated iupulses and ruder fanaticisi of theuther personages in his story."" '1he two most interesting characters in the Eneid are 'urnus and Dido, and on these twvo it is diltioult to add anything to the excellent remarks of )1r. Conington in his i'reface to the Lciiod. To the modern and romantic element which that scholax rec.lgni,ed in the story Of 1 urnus and Lavinia wve called attention nearly three years ago in a review of Mr. Collins's "" Virgil"" But
r. Uwninhtoa has also pointed out that both ill Turnus ann 1ido Virgil was oppressed by the difliculty of describilg theso characters in the tone pioper to the Hioneric age while himself under tho influence of feelings belonging to a later civilization and prompting him rather to syinpathise with misfortune than to regard it with incifference as the inevitable result of opposition to tlhe Divine will. Had Homer drawn a a urnas and a Dido, we should not have bueen allowed to feel a spark of sympathy with either. ilad a modern poet drawn them, we should have felt none for anybody else. In Virgil our sympathies are divided,and this, in Conington's opinion,explains what has been generally considered the unsatisfactory effect of the whole poem. 'i his view, howvever, has recently found a formidablo critic in Mr. Nettleship, who, in his very ingenious
Suggestions introductory to a study of the 'Lanicid' published in 1875,propounds a theory of the poem, which, if accepted, certainly does away with this objection, though at the cost of the chief interest wvhlch it has for ordinary readers. Be endeavours to prove that Virgil had no such sympathy with 'Turus as Mr. Conington supposes, and attributes this error to the habit of carrying with us to the perusal of the writers of antiquity the spirit and associations of modern literature. Virgil
he asserts, was no romance writer. He is telling no love story in the persons of his fable. The love of Dido for LE;neas and of Turnus for Lavinia is, in his eyes, the embodiment of lhuman passion in confiiet with Divine law. That is all he means to illstrate by it. `ihe LEneid represents the triumph of civilization over barbarism ; and lurnus, with all his good points, is merely a barbarian, fierce vindictive, and cruel, representing the evil principle in the drama at war with the higher Powers. Tiis view, enforced though it is with great and v aried ingenuity,wve confesswle are unable to accept. lt is im3possible, in our opinion, to read the preparation for the single combat betwseen 'lurnus and
ucas, and then to believe that ';no genuine trace of sympathy for Turinus "" is to be found in the Lueid. 'lhe appearance of Turnus himself as he advances to take the necessary oaths seems directly intended to excite our sympathies in common with the sympathy of the R utulian. Ihe words wvhich Suturna whispers in the ears of the assembled multitude suggest exactly what each must have been feeling, though Le niight not have been able to express it in the form of words:-
Illle quidem, ad superos, quorum se devovet aris, *Succedet famnt, vivusquo per era feretur ;
""N-os, lpatri amnissA, doninis parere superbis ""Cogenmur, qui nuac lenti cousedimus urvir""
""He who now devotes himself for his country's good will be received among the gods and shall live for ever in the voices of posterity. We, the cowards who look tamely on, shall be robbed of our country, and become the slaves of an invader."" That Virgil wvas inlsensible to the roniance of tbe situation it is
impossible to believe. Nor can we agree with Mr. Seflar that we are left without the knowledge by which to measure the extent of the wrong done to Lavinia and Turnus by the enforced severing of their af'ections. M1r. Conington has done such ample justice to the character of Dido, and to the overpowering interest of the human *lement in her story, that we need say no more on this bead. Mr. Sellar, on the wlhole, follows the lead of Mr. Coning. ton, and the followinig lines, in widch he sums up the character and conception oI TurlS, as it seems to us, exactly hit the mark -
1'i'he poot's syml4athy with the hikh spirit of youth, as nmahifested in love and wbr, atd his pride in the strong metal out of which tle ltalian *vas made, have led hhn, perhaps involuntarily, to an embedimneDt of those chivalrous qualities which affect the miodern imagination, *ith more powerful sympathy thaLin the qualities of a temperate will and obedlence to duty which he has striven to emubody in the representation of .,Eneas.""
The concluding pages of the volume deal with Virgil's style, and it would be wronging Mr. Sellar not to quote his just and beautiEl description of it -
"" By its construction of opposite excellences, the style of the & neid is at once an admirable vehicle of continuous or compresmed narrative, of large or concpntrated description, of fluent and inmpassioned, or composed and impressive oratory. It possesses, also, the power which distinguisl'es the older Latin writers, of stamping sonme grave or magnDanimOus lessn inimperLbhable characterson the nuird. But Virgil is not only great as a Latin writer. The concurrent

Null,Recent Poetry.*,The Times,1877-Feb-09,"London, England",".RBOBNT POBtRY.+
The author of ""The Songs of Twvo Worlds nIas completed his cycle of the "" Epic of Ilades "" by the addition of two new books, the titles of which-Tartarus and Olympus-express their subjects.. Eis present volumes continue the promise of his earlier work, and advance it, somewbat further towarts fulfilment. In one seanse the idca of his Epic is not only ambitious, but audacious, for: it necessarily awakens reminiscences of Dante. In another, however, it shows a just appreciation ef'his special power of anssimilating poetical fancies and wveaving' them into graceful forms, for it supplies him with congenial themes, which he casts cleverly into miodern shapes and turusinto practical and profitable teachings. Che charactcr of the eioem may be said to be a Christisnized PaganiMn. The deities of his Olympus are refined and idealized ; even Aphroditd disavows the grossness of the senlsual worsbip that *vas paid her. Herd is the Goddess of Duty, Ar.temis embodies the spirit of knowledge and wisdom, while Zeus is the great primal cause and power, the all-pervading soul of the world, but dimly comnprehensible to human perceptions. The author searches forhiddei meniningsin the creations (f ite old mythology and ingeniously shows them susceptible of unsuspected interpretatious. Not unfrequently he is charmingly pathetic, as in his Helen and his Psycho ; hs I)eianeira and his Eurydice ; and the powers of love, of song, and of beauty are his prevailing themes. In a Fiebruary ,dream, on the eve of the translation to iades-
"" I seemed to movo
""Thro' that weird laud, Hilleric fancy feigned, ""Beyond the fabled river and toe bark
Of Cbhroll e and forthwitb on every side 'Bose tho tbin throng of gliosts.""
It is not as il thse inferno of tne Florentines, wher# all hope is left behind. T'he spirits are waiting, as we shall wait, the beatific end ;"" they are touched by melancholy mSiiories. cheered. by unforgotten joys ; and by the light of reflection, as in a new inspiration, they read the bitter lessons ol their lives, wihich are sweetened by the hopes of a bappier immortality. Appropriat.ly enough, the first meeting of thu poet in that world of spectres is with the shade of SEarsyas, to vvbom death has brought consolation, if not oblivion. The victim ot the wratliful rivalry of the Sun God cau almost rejoice in the rash challenge whicb pronmaturely qu,nched his joyous ambitions. It is better to have tailed gluriously than to be contented with mere ignoble succ-ss, and only to have listened to the godlike song of the victor and executioner soothed the pangs of a terrible deatu. Not that - the New Writer cloihes the penalty paid by M7 arsyss in the rLalistic horrors that were revelled in by clasRdcal Lxicographer and mudiatval artists. The loser is not flayed with cold-bloodLd deliberation, and all that 'is io be distin6tuished beneath his loosened robe is ""the scar of cruel stripes, t-o hastily concealed."" So mnodern poetical licence comes in elsewheze to relieve the darker shadovws and fill in the hursher outlines of the legends thlat have ben hand.d down to us fromantiquity. The petrless Helen h-.a gone through almost as many adventures as the betrotrhd brido of Boccaccio's King of Garba. We are present at her first meeting with the shepherd who won her virgin love, when they
"" watched the waves
""Steal sbrerward, and beyond the sylvan caves,
The immeasurable laughter of the sea.""
The poet makes Helen really a woman, and brings us into gentle symyathv with the fatal beauty who had sown miserg broadcast. The fatal gift ot her beauty clings to Ler anid pUTS it out of her power to make reparation, although her heart is devoured with r.morse. iFrom the w-alls of Ilium she makes a passionate appeal to the chiefs of the besieging host, imploring thtm to leave the form that is but ths shell of a "" once loving woman. "" At first they incline to listen, but- then comes a touch of nature, suggestive ot that semibarbarous age :-
""With a mixed pride and terror, I beheld
""The brute rise up within them, and my words ""Fall barren on them.""
In the mnidst of the sack and slaughter, when she would have rushed upon the swords of the conquerors, not one of them is raised aggainst her. Exhausted by emotions,
A e"" swooued and fell,
Ancl knew no more, Arnd wheni I woke I felt
""Zily husband's arms arouud me, and tha wind
"" fiew air for Greece, and the beaked galley plunged, Acnd where the towns of lliumrose of old, "" A pall of smoke, above a glare of fire.""
There is considerable force and no small imagination in the description of some of the approximate tortures in "" the Tartarus ; "" as when the Tantalus, the sated and blood-stained seosualist, who has fearfully abused lis day of unlimited power, narrates his melancholy story in the bitterness of tardy remorse.
"" WVe are ourselves
""Our heaven and hell, the joy, the penalty,
"" The yearni6, the fruidon. Earth is hell ' . iOr heaven, and yet rot only earth ; but still ""After the swift seal leaves the gtes of deaKh,
""The pain grows deeper and less mixed, the ioy ""Parer and leis alloyed, and we re damned, ""Or blest, as we have lived.""
* f . f * X
""Then as I looked, I saw

""And mockery of bope. ' Seest thon there now?v ""lie said. 'Ithirst, parch, I famish, yet
They still elude me,-fair and tempting fruit, And cooling waters' ""
There is genuine pcetical feeling and observation in the metaphor that likens the glorious vision of Olvmpus to the "" one fair day,"" when one first breathes inthe fragrance and the beauties of the dawning spring after the lengthened winter:-
""One only and no more wvhich year by year
On tSprig-time comes, when lingering winter flies, ""And 1o, the trees blossom in white and pink ""And golden clusters, and the glades are fu31 ""Of yellow primrose and sweet odorous beds ""Of violets, and in the tufted fields
""With kingoups starred and cowslip bell and blue ""Sweet byacinths and fril anemo,es.
'The broad west wind breathes softly, and the Jir ""Is tremulous with the lark, and thro' the woods ""The soft full-throated thrushes all day long
""Flood the green dells with joy, and throug the dry ""Brown tields the sower goeg, sowing his seed, ""And all is life and song.-""
We might invite attention to mtany other passages, such as the softened moral of the Medusa, and the pretty scene from Psy'che, inculcating Faith as the foundation of Love. But it is more easy to give honest, general praise than to single out particular extracts.
The author of ""The Earthly Paradise "" hs cast in a more graceful form the story that bas so long been a favburite with the Germana, that it may be almost said to have been nsturalized among them. Who has not read the "" Niebelungen Lied"" in one shape or another t Who has not sighed over the melancholy fate of the glorious Siegfried, and yet been moved irresistibly afterwards to symronthy with his murderers, as they rode deliberately to their death to fall overwhEelmed by numbers in ' the gloomy banquet-ting halls of the Hns? The lives and death of the f'ated heroes have been commemorated in Schnorr'a spirited frescoes on the wals of the Kmnigsbau at -Munich, and Wagner revived them in the crash of his boisterous music at the representations that attracted the world to Bayreuth. But in the German reproduction of the famouas myths, there are glaring defects and harsh inconsistencies that belong to a ruder and primitive school of puety. Mr. Morris has gone back to the simpler sources of the Scandinavian Sega, and besides he has given his imagination free play, untraminnelled by Teutonic traditions, Unrlquestionably the subject gains by his original method of handling. The masculine Burgundian Princess with the thews and tastes of a warrior, is
refined into the wise and beautiful Brynhild, shrinking -and flushin- under a humuiliating intrigue that outraged the delicacy of her womanhood. Much is changed in the manner of her winning, as in the love passages with the hero whose htart is charmed from her. '[he Obriemild of the Lied reappears as the wise witch mother of the Niblungs; wilIe it is her daughter Gudrun -who becomes passionately enamoured of Sigurd, whom she weds, to her sorrow aned the ruin of her house. Of Gudrun's brothers, Gunther becomes Gunnar in Mr. Morris poem the far-seeing and noble Hugen is Eagin, and gtzel, the leader of the Runs, Atli, ""King of the ka;st!nd folk""
Like the bards of those sOngs of intelmingled mythology, legend, dud history with which the Scalds of Scandinavia beguiled the interminable feasts of their waTiors, Mr. Morris has written at unusual
length, nor can we acouit him altDgether of diffuseness. He carries Us Lack for a generation before the birth of his hero; to the story of tifziurd's f:itiher, Sigmund, and even of his grandfathler Wolsung. Hfe diverfes intO suchl rarvellou6s episodes as the Master iegin has to iatrrate of the visit of the gods to the ge's kindred; -of the. enchanted treasure they paid for their ransorm and of what had becomo~ of the hoard sin5e then. But the ensemble of the poem is admirablypreserved; its construction is all in accordance with the soirces which have inspired its ideas; while its various parts arrange themselves in natural and obvious conneaion. In one part Mr. Mlorris, perbaps, departs somewhat from his Scandinavian models, but .ith no insuflicientreason, if he is to please our modern tastes. Love in his poem is no mere distraction-the passion of a fierce -warrior for a fair faee and a tempting, form, indrblaed as the interlude to graver business. 'I hrough the clash of armour and the din of battle there rise the subdued strains ttat thrill from impassiuned hearts, so that a real nod earnest human interest is mixed up with the mythical and mysterious el. meuts. As for the myths and the mystery, tho bare sketch of the poem will show that the authior has made powerful use of them, while in tbe more mechanical part of the worlmanslip he has undoubtedly surpassed his former efforts. There is a smooth flow in the' versificatiun, with no lack either of strength or norve ; there isa graceful adaptation of apt mietaphor, and a happy appresiction of vi orous epithets. Occasionally there is some senise of 1teratiLn andarepetition, wtich, however, appears to be almunt unavoidable l wheen one writes at such length of suhbj,ts so similar in their character. More than once-as in the allusion to the gods sitting carless in their celestial seats-we fancy we recognize a reflection from passages in other poets. But, on the whole, Air. Morris showvs Marked origiuality of thought and espression in dealing with his borrowed story, Lnd he has made it no easy task for those ivho may follow hiln to me-rit simuilar praise with equal.reason.
The book is divided into four books, each bearing the name o'f the leading Lizure in it. The Openin-g scene is very striking. - There is a gatherang in the halls of King Volsung, where Siggeir, the Goth, has come with his Earls to carrv home as his bride the "" snow-wvhite Signy."" The ieastingis itertrupied by the arnival of a mysterious stranger, *'nd such was the guise of his rimï¿½nt, as the Volsung
elders had told
'-Was born. by their father's father, and the first that
vWarred in the world.""
He is the bearer of a jewel-hilted brand, which he drives home into the stem of the "" War Duke's Tree,"" the Branstock. The sword shall be the prize of the hero who has the strenrgth to draw it forth. Sig4eir fails with Volsung and his stalwart children, till it comes to the turn of Sigmund, who dra`ws the blade away without an effort. He denies it to the, magitificent offers of the Goth King, who goes to his home r.sentful, to ensnare and slaughter the kiLnsmen of bis bride, Sigmund alone exc=pted. As for "" the sword that came from Odin,"" after long sL-vice it is shattered at last in a fatal battle, and leaves its master to fall defericeless "" on the death heap his deeds had piled th.t day.""
""111 hour for Sigmuad's fellows i they fall like the seeded
hay
'Before the brovwn scythe's sweeping, and there the isle-
KIn fell,
&In the forepart ef the hattie wherein he wrought right well,
' ""And soon they were nought but foemen who stand upon
their feet,
""On the isle-sn-and by the ocean, where the grass and the
sea-sand weet,""
Sigurd, the fated son of the fallen lord, is brought up at the feet of Rea-in, an ancient man of wondrous wisdom. ]&IatchYess in all but arms, lRegin anticipates the modern influencesof mnind and thought:-
""The love of all nen he lnew,
wAn orw def. iu every cunning save the dealings of the
sword.
So sweet has his tongue-speech fashioned, that me
trowed b every word.-
The silver-tongued master means to use his pupil to win him back the Niblungtreasure from the super'natural "" worm"" that broods on it and guards it, the worm being no other than Fafnir, the brother of Regin. Regin reforges the shivered framnents of the sword of Odin, and Sigurd seeks the adventure armed with the enchanted blade and mounted on his steed GreyfelL Tasting acidentaUytbe blood that streans from the dragon, his ears are opened to the voices of the birds; he awakens to the malignant.intentions of Regin, and esays him in self-defence. Nothing can be more spirited than the quick; interchange of speech between the.m wvhen Sigurd rather than slay his msaster vwould ""ransom his head"" wfith the fatal gold, while P.egin, in spite of his intense lsonging for the treasure, wsill not accept it as the payment for his brother's blood.
""'egin crouched and darkened and over the earth le hung,
And, he said, ' Thou hart slain miy brother and the gods
are yet but young.""'
Sigurd acconiphahes their double destiny, and rides away to unearthl the hoard that ha-. always brought its master maisfortune, Heo wins on 'his way the heart of Brynhild, who passiorntelyreturns his affection. Blut the fair-armed GudGrun ""smiles on him in her heart,"" with the heroes of her house; and her mother Chriemiild throws her magic spell over hin,; and he forgets Brynhild in Gudruu's embrace.
The rest of the poem is full of profound pathos and tragedy. The evil spells of Chriemhild have wvrought msery for her cherished son as for her datughter. WVe have the humiliating treaohery practised on Brynhild, betraved to her by a hasty taunt in her unhappy quarrel with Gudrun. We have the vengeance to which ehestirred her busband and the Niblungs for the vindication of her outraged honour; altnoug bshe looked upon her work and the corpse of the slain hero with a heart as near to breaking -as that of his bereaved bride. Gudrun had
"" Gazed and the love gathered on her, so exoeeding far
away
Seened all she once had cherished from that which near
her lay.
"".She wed, adit craved nopity, nd therein wsaothing
Ea ,
""Therein was clean forgotten the bope that Sigurd had;
""Then she looked around and about her, as though her
friend to find,
""And me t these woful faces but ag gray reeds in the vind *And sh5 turned to the King beneath her, and raised her
hands on high,
""And fell on the body of Sigurd vith a great and bittr
cry-.
Markedoutas the instrument of doom to the two men she wedded tud to the warriors of her father's house, the last book teUs how Gudrun gave her hand to Atli that he might , slaughter all who should have been the most dear to her. There is a terrible picture of the stony-faced wvidow of Sigurd and wife of Atli, looldng on in silence from her chair of state at the deeds of the dying heroes. Finally she redeems her fearful deed of vengeaace with another, and sets a torch to-the blood-steeped halls that hold her Eastland husband and his ""w ine drenched earls."" Then, wending her way to the distant sea with no one to hinder, she drowns herself, wills her crimes and sorroiws, in the waters. We may say safely that subjects sombre almost to repulsion have very seldom been handied with greater delicacy and harmony.
We take it that the surest teet of poetical talent is originality while wo are old-fashioned enough to believe also that melodyof expression and harmony of action are absolutely indispensable adjuncts to the genuine enjoyment of poetry. mr. Ellis'S
are far from lacdking in the last two quitimes! There are many passages wbere graceful and even noblethoughts are clothed in soft and sonorous rhythm. But what we mnis in him, in common
with so many other writers, is freshnEss of ideas. After all, as the world grows older, as literary activity is increased, . and the faculty of -writing is developed, it dafly becomes more and more difficult to find virgin exercising ground for your Pegasus, now that every inch of of turf round the Castalian fount has been cut up and beaten down with reiterated prancings. There is scarcely a subject that has not been sung and re-sung, unless you should take the latest scientific invention for your theme, and treat of telegraphs, torpedoes, ot some patent piece of mechanism in the style made classcal by the Loves of the Triangles. Mr. Ellis has not hizarded so daring a fight, And consequiently he has fallen ahort of originality in common wFith the great mass of his competitors. But he shbws a lively fancy and a happy facuity of expression. Nor can he be sad in the ehoiee of his lUading iubject to show
aysgns of timdity. Quite the reverse. ""Car in E~ypt"" offei-s noble apCoe alike to the ima-

thouga it seems to us unforttnrts that they should be confli;ting. The lovte passages between Cleopatra and the Conqueror lend themselvesb t emphatic situations that are both painful i
pathetic. But the mind ought to be arrested and held fast in following the play of their viGlent passions, and it breaks the continuity (t that main argument when the atteution is suddenly diverted into a totally different, ebannel. It mav be taken as historical that the Romnasn made the tour vf Egyptian marvels with the beautitul enchantress wvho had bewitched him for his ciceronw. lhere is the theme for hall-a-aoz.n of soul-stirring epics,in the immortal memories that looked down on their gilded barges, as they were rowed up stream under the shadow of the Pyramids, under the cliffs of caverned tombs, and the pillared porticos of stupendous temples. But the t.-ains of our ideas clash; the interests that ha.ve been excited in us change; and the space to which l r. l .Ellis must confine himself limits him to almogs a bald cata, logue of allusions.
At the same time there is much that is pleasing in the poem. C01opatra,,then a pretendLr to the Throne, determines to be the mistruss- of the mighty I'oman, and thinks of herself and her charrms as an otlering worthy of him.- She is borne into his Palace by . faithiful friend, in the guise of a bale of precious merchandise, a4a laid on a coach in his chamber. lHe dr-aws aside the veil and dis. clos stthe rsatchless features,-

Null,Persian And Indian Poetry.*,The Times,1876-Jan-05,"London, England",".PEBSIAN AID INVDIAN PozTIy.*
I
Although the English have a far greater atake in the East than any other nttion, yet, strange to say, wve have hitherto done less towards elucidating and investigating Oriental literature than almost any other nation in Etrope. But if ve consider that the wvorks of the master minds of a people are the best and most infallible guides to the light understanding of their-feesling and sentiments, we cannot fail to regret this auDineness. Fortunately, the reproach is at last being gradually removed, and although the Government is stiU indifferent in the matter, private enterprise is supplying the deficiency, nnd popular translations of the Indian and Persiani classics are appearing with a frequency that argues a greater and more intelligent interest in the subject. One of the most important of these works is that just issued by 3Iessrs. Triibner, tho dfivn or collected poenms of Hdfiz :Shfrdz, translated into English verse by Herman Bicknell.
The name of Hdfiz, the national poet of Persia, is familiar enough, no doubt, to most people, but to any one except an Oriental scholar it suggests little more than a vague idea of Bulbuls, roses, and Eastern love tales. The recognized interpreter of Oriental poetry to the English reader is Moore, and lovers of "" Lalla Rookh "" will easily recognize in the name of the Persian bard that of Hafed, the hero of "" The Fire Worshippers."" Yet this very name shows boiv superficisl was Moore's acquaintance wvith Eastern tlhings, and how very imperfect his rendering of Eastern poetry must be. Hafiz is a title given in Muslim countries to any learned theologian who has committed the wvhl,ole of the Koran to memory, and, therefore, is the very last name that should have been chosen for an Arab-hating, anti-Moslem, <;uebre chief. In the present case it is the nwm de plume of 6hems ed din Mohammed of tihfrlz, one of the most eminent of the mystical poets which Persia has produced. His works consist of about 700 poems, chiefly of those called ghazals, or odes, short pieces with the same rhyme to every alternate verse throughout. Of thie style and subject-matter of these poems we shall speak presently.
In L{ermany much has been done for the wvorks of lHlfiz. A magnificent critical edition of tile text has been issued and edited by Brockhaus ; and metrical translations by Von Hammer, by Itosenzweig,of Vienna, and by Nesselman, of Berlin, have also appeared. England, however, has done little, if anything, towards making known these really remarkable lays, and beyond a few forgotten nietrical versions in old nunibers of the Asiatic Aiiaccllany, and an able article in a recent number of MacmiUain's Magazine, HRfi7 has never found an exponent in this country. Tho translation of the poems of Hldfiz, by Hermani Bicknell, which has just appeared, is therefore the more welcome as it really fills up a serious gap in literature. Mr. Bicknell's career was a strange and adventurous one. As a military surgeon in India, he first made his acquaintaneo with the East, and he subseauently visited Java, China,Cashmere, 'l'ibet, Egypt; Syria, and Arabia, and even performed the pilgrimage to Mecca. Unlik-e his great predecessor in this exploit, Captain Burton, he tvent wvithout disguise of person or nationality; but his biographer, in telling us this, says nothing abont the Moslem rites and observances which he must have followed to qualify for the journey, for as a Kafir it is clear that he would not have been permitted to enter the Holy City. Mr. Bicknell was a man of decidedly eccentric habits, but his eccentrieities led him to do some useful things, this translation of H4tiz among the number.
How thoroughly the late Mr. Bicknell studied his author and prepared himself for the wvork of translating may be gathered from the fact that he went toTersia and resided for some time at Shirdz vith the sole object of making himself acquainted with the scenes amid wbich HIafiz wrote. 'The beautiful designs of Mr. Haerbert, B.A., which are included in the volume enable the reader to realize these surroundingrs for himself. ere we have the
afizfyah, a district of :;hira.z, in which many of the spots mentioned in the odes lie, and a scene in whichi Persian revellers are carousing to music and singing. In these two pictures which are executed in chromo-lithography, the peculiar brightness aud clearness of the Eastern atmosphere is admirably rendered. The volume also contains a good coloured lithograph of Bdtiz's tomb and some equisite little woodcut vignettes by other hands. This is, unfortunately, a posthutnous work, as the translator did not live to complete his labours, but died while the first sheets were in the Press. It was his original intention to publish the whole of the poems of 1II1fiZ; but, as we aro told in the proface,he ultimately "" determined to select only front those poems which ho considered the best, and undoubtedly genuine."" The selection is no doubt a good one,-any selection from Hafiz, even at random, would be good,-but we cannot help thinking that it is owing rather to tne progress already made by the translator when he resolved to publish than to the reasons adduced. There is, at least, one poem of more than doubtful authenticity, the wellknowvn tdza ba tfdza woo ba now, and some of the best odes, and occasionally even the best part of an ode, are omitted. For example, in page 1% we find-
""At morn I sought tho garden-tle scent of flowers
my lure,
""For as tho lu rt-re, t bulbul, I wished my brain
to cure.
''en as the rose oh H6fizz
"" lirtb, bliss, ana youth-time prize, ""lNo duty but his messrge ""Upon the envoy lies.""
But the entire ode, of which this is only part, contains some wonderfully poetic imagery. It may be thus paraphrased-
*'Twas morning, tnd I took my way
AAmong the gardens' scented bowers,
""Wiiere buibuls trill'd their love-lorn lay ""To serenade the maiden flowers.
""Liko him oppressed by love's sweet pain, ""I wander in that garden fair;
""And there, to cool ray throbbing brain,
I woo the perfumed morning s,ir.
""The damoask rose in beauty glearms, ""Iti face all bathed in ruddy light
"" And glows like some bright star trit beams ""From out the sombre veil of night. ""The rery bulbul, as the glow
Of youth and passion filled his breast, ""Forgot in song his former woe,
""Vith pride that conquers love's unrest. ""The lily seemed to menace me,
""And showed its curved and quiveriagblada; ""And every frail anemone
""A gossip's open mouth displayed. ""And bere and there a little group
""Of flowers? like men who worship wiLe, ""Each holdiag up its tixy stoup
""To catch the dewrops' draught divine. ""And others still like Hebes stand,
"":Their dripping vases downwardl turned ""As though dispensing to the band
""The wine forwhiok tkeir heartshad yearned. ""This moral it is mine to sing,
""'Go learn a lesson from the flowQrs-
""'Love's season is in Youth's fair spring,
""'Then seize like- them the fleeting hours.'
The translator has endeavoured to reproduce in English the original Inetres of the Persian, and, so far as success is possible, he has been successful.
To reproduce the single rhyme that occurs in every alternate hemi-stich of each ode is obviously impossible, and the resemblance to the Persian is therefore never complete. This being the case, we think it would have been much better to select English metres with corresponding movements ; the result would certainly have been more pleasing to an Einglish ear. The fact is that the metres in any language are not artificial or arbitrary forms; they grow naturally out of the accentuation of individdial words in the language, certain groups of which, of definite length, become more pleasing than others. Now, since in English the voice is invariably depressed at the end of a sentence, while in Persiai it is slightly elevated and prolonged, there is au initial difficulty in the way of representing one metre by the other. To put a foreign metre servilely into Englislh words is like translating literally into a foreiga language and following the syntactical arrangement of the original. T'hus ""It -wants to take the occasion by the hairs"" (lye are quoting from a publislhed book of dialogues) is an exact representation of the French ""I'R fat prendre l'occasion par les chevex ,"" but it would surely be better rendered by, "" We must take time by ito forelock.""
The plan followed by MIr. Bicknell has this additional inconvenience-that the tonic and rhythmic accent will cbnstantly clash. For instance, on'page 20 wo find this couplet-
""A lis I that th6se bold Lilifin, iwkose bl5ndish- -
mfats the *olt'n embroil.S "" Should hilve borne 6finy.hetirt's coatlint as d6
tho Tfirks their trhy of spoiL.""
Now, tliis is a good specimuen, but even here we
find the rhythmio accent falling on the slubordinate words ""these,"" ""have,"" "" off"" "" do,"" to say notlhing of the final syllable ""tn,"" the Persianl plural, in ""Lulian. The word Lq'd i8 tightly explained by the translatbr as the appellation of a certain tribe of iioznade renowned in the time of Ilidtiz fo r their danicinig aud singing talents. They are, no doubt, identical with the lIhrts wlio were introd(luced into Persia froin dia by Yezdegird, and are, in all proa
bability, the ancestors of the modern Oriental gipsies wlho, in ISyria, Arabia, and other parts of the East, are knowii by the name of irf. The word Ltlf is still used in Persian as a synonym for ""wanton,"" "" bold,"" "" vagabond,"" just as BoUrnjien is used in France.
One of the most succesaful imitations in the volume of the original melody and rhythm is the following-:
""0 ast I my story gently tell, to yonder slender-
shaped gazelle.
'ris thou by whom ifirst was led the wilderness
and luUc to tread.
""That sugar vendor (yet, I pray, to live in joy for
Malay a daY)
""Should ask-what canse prevents ?-how speeds
this parrot who on suzgar feeds ?
""When, at some dear companion's side, thou
measurest the wine-cup's tide,
Remember then the lover band who nothing bat
the wind have scanned.
0 ross I thy beauty's pride, may be, hath loft thee
not in conscience freo
""To ask how fAres, or weak or h'de, thy lone, dis-
tracted-nightingale.
A character of beauty rare can inteUectual men
ensnare :
""Not by the net and trap's device can we the ,iary
- bird entice.
I kaownot why vwe never view sweet intimnaoy
colotur true
In thosa who, black of eye aud tall, possess a silver
moon withal.
A single blemish casts a gloom upon thy loveliness's
bloom
""Of faith aid constancy no trace is found upon thy
beauteous face.
""Thaukful for friends who time beguile, aud for
tby Fortune's lasting smile,
Think of the stranger emit by pain upon the open
sterile plain.
""WhiLt marvel that ;n heaven are sung ""The dulcet woords by ltfiz strung,
""Or that, by Zuhral's air entranced, ' lessia in hiM 1^ . - I- - .2
With us a parrot wouid not be a complimentary comparison, for a poet, but in the East it is looked upon as a most melodious bird, and Mifiz applies the simile to himself with no notion of anyttiing ludicrous being suggested by it. The silver moon is the bright face of the beloved one Zuhrah, Venus, with the 2ersians a celestial minstrel.
The key to the interpretation of Hafiz's songs is to be founid in a combination of Materialism and Suflism-that strange system of metaphysical philosophy and theosophy which.has.sprung up from the endeavour to reconcile two such diametrically opposite cults as the Pantheism of the Aryan races and the severe -Monotheism of their Senmitic conquerors. The Eastern poet aims at leading his readers to the contemplation of spiritual things by appealing to their emotions. The delights of earthy beauty and the pleasures of the sense are e=thuiastically described by him, but behind this veil of allegory there really does often lurk a spirit of devotion to the Deity, a yearning after perfection, and a longing after eternal love. One of the most remarkable features in the works of the Sufi or metaphysical poets of the East is the absence of ldahomedan fanaticism. They claim to be in so intimate a communion with tho Deity, through devotion and the cultivation of their higher and nobler feelings, that they can afford to rise superior to the petty details of dogma and superstition.
To ignore the presence of a mystical element in these poems would be to rob them of half the spirituality of thieir conception and to render many passages hopelessly obscure; but, on the other hand, to ignore tlhe fact that natural feelings and sentiments, the contemplation of natural beauity and the enjoyment of human intellectual and corporeal pleasures, did not suggest the various expressions of admiration, love, or wit which these poems contain vould be contrary to the dictates of commoni sense. There can be no doubt that Hdfiz wvas deeply imbued with the mystic philosophy of his sect, yet not only his poems but the incidents of his life itself show that he wa3 an ardenit lover of the beautiful, and wvas capable of a keen enjoyment of material pleasures. That all his witty profanities (and the poems contain many such) were not mere mystic utterances to be received in an exactly opposite sense is also obvious from tho view which his contemporaries took of his religious views.
""On account of the supposed heterodoxy of certain passages in the D1V5n, diculties were raised as to the interinent of Hfifiz vith the rites of religion. The poetic oracle (like the sortes. Virvilia,ue), however, bemng consulted, all doubts were met at rest by tho following couplet:-
"" WVish not to turn thy foot away from lifiz on his bier;
* He shall ascend to Paradise though steepod in sin
while liere.""
This double character Mr. Bicknell has perceived and appreciated,and his versions are in consequence much more valuable than any of the few that have been hitherto published. Until now European and Oriental sarants have taken diametricallv opposite views of the question, the former deoJaring for their entirely material and Anacreontic character, while the latter persist in seeing some theosophic allusioII in the most ordinary erratic rhapsody. To understand HRfiz one mnust hit the bappy mean, and, thanxs to MIr. Bicknell, the English reader here has ample facilities and every informiation requisite for trriving at it.
Take the following, evidently thoughts jotted down while gazing some calm night at the crescent moon in the deep clear sky -
""I gazed on the green field of heaven snd tho sickle
of the moon ;
Of my owin fields I then bethought mae, and of the
hrvest's boon.
ft t *t *
""t Messiah-like, if pure and free thou take to heaven
thy flight,
Thy lamp, a hundred beasrs emitting, shall make the
sun more brigbt.
Let Heaven of all her pomp boast less; for in Love's
world they view
""But as one grain the lunar harvest, the Pleiad
sheaves as two.
""Religion's harvest wiiU be burnt By guile and false pretence.
Oh, HAfiz,.dressed in woolen mnantle, Discard it and go henco.""
""ere, though the thougbts are high and noble, there is nothing mystio or artificial ; the poet, face to faco with nature, feels that freedom, purity, and sincerity are the only means of aoquirixj truo fame and attaining real piety. His Der vi,sfidress-his clerical garb-sits uneasily on him, for he feeJs that he is no longer playing a par before men, but is communing at last with the Infinite. It is one of the few passages where the man involuntarily bursts through all the trammels of Oriental conventionality.
As a specimen of H&&fiz's more fanciful moods we rmay take this:-
3Iy friend to the Magian's cloister come with a goblet
gssped in his hand ;
Ho reeled with wine, and kis narcissi (1) rendered
drunk the carousin: band.
""The crescent form of the new-born moon on the hoof
of his courser flasked
The pine tree, too, though of stature tall, at his
stately heigkt was abashed.
""What now shaU I say, II know myself,' when I feel
that my sense is dim ?
H wr now can I say I I lova him not,' when moy eyes
are bent on bim ?
-Wvent down the lightia his fellows' hearts when he
sought from his seat to rise,
""Goes up the shout of elated friends as again to his
seat hehies.
If civet breathes a 'lelicious scent, from that lock was
the odour caught;
If incligo deftly spatns the bow (2), by that eyebrow's
sreh was it taught.
Return, my friend, that yet nay return To thy Hhiz the life that is fled -
Though o return of the *haftLis aiiow From the hand of the obowmn spid.""
Wer might multiply instances of the quaint conceits witb hhich the volunie teems, but the following will sufiLce as a specimen
""0 thou whoso bat of amber hangs o'er a moon below, ""Deal Uot to mo so giddy the anguish of a blowv;""
where theo curl of hair over a moonlike face is compared tb a curbed polo-bat xweeping over a ball. Amiber, or ambergris, by the by, and musk, are used to i±idicate the dark colour of the locks rather than their fragrance.
""I know not what darkprojedts thoab pointed loeks design,
That once again in tauglesthieirmuskyeOurlscombiie.1l
But, containing fs they do so much tbat is quaint, suggestive mystical, and beautiful, it is inipoasible to do justice to the poems by a fewuquotations. They even- desorveuo more thitn X cursory perusal, and will amply repay deep and thotightful studye
The notes, although aomewthat too eonicise. con-
tain for tho most part aU that is requisite to put the reader ant courant witlh tho stock qutotations and allusions of Persian poetry. Here and there, however, an Arabio quotation is given, and it is clear that the translator's Irnowledge of the latter language was not equal to his undoubted mastery of Persian. For example, in p. 19, an Arabie verse is given, and both tlhe text and the translation contain a mistake. In the text thut words ' an kar2b "" soon"" are written Persian fashion, ' an-kartb; and in the translation ladt? lit-mcnti wa'bnmf likluardbi is rendered "" drawn nigh to death for ruin build,"" instead of "" bring forth children to death,"" &c.
The fact that the Persian language makes no distinction between the masculine and fetninine gender is nieutioned in the introduction as otie great difticulty in tho way of translation. We should rather have thought the opposite was the case, and that this vagueness woould give the translator a latitudo in rendering love-songs which he would hesitate to take in the more precise Arabic and Hindustani. Oriental poets, whether from the habit of keeping women and all connected with them rigorously in the background, or from tthe fact that their rhapsodies are really intended to be addressed to the deity; or from some otber cause, do as a rule address all their erotic verses ia the masculine gender. To such an extent is this carried that two grave and reverend Doctors of Divinity will address colmpliruentary stan7as to each other, couched in language which would come more appropriately from the pen of a romalntic
sOlcool girl.
HA&fl is not only tlhe typical poet of Persia; but his works are a cyclopiedia .f Eastern lore. In Oriental poetry there is a certain nuniber of common-places which occur over and over again in all poetical works. What Eastern poets aim at is to give new turns to old conceits, not to invent new ones. With them originality of conception is a vice, imitation a virtue. The very word bid'at, originality, has come to mean ""heresy,"" any nevwfangled and abominable doctrine; and this idea they carry into their literature. Thus it is that if wve once master HAfiz we have the key to all tho Persian, Turkislh, and Indian erotic or mystical
poets.
1Iuch credit is due to Messrs. Trilbner for placing tho works of such a poet within the reach of ordinary readors; and we shall not be. surprised to find traces in the poetic literature of the future of the influence of stich a popular renderino'of oine of the grandest efforts of tho Persian M.tuse. %he faults of Persian poetry-exaggerated metaphors and strained Lsimiles-are faults that lie upon the surface only, while undernleath there is a current of true poetic feeling. Conceits as fanciful as any which the Italian school has producod, combined with deep earnest thoughts, forcibly expressed, are its peculiar characteristics ; and, at the same time, the varmth of the Oriental nature shows itself in passionate utterances, which, however, seldom, if ever, degenerate into sensuality. Theso distinctive characteristics of the Persian hMuise are well brought out in the volurne before us, and if the translation lacks something of the melody of the original it is owing to the trammels imposed by a strange and unsuiitable idiom.
Thefew faults which we have indicated abov4 really detract but little from the value of the work, nor should we, perhaps, have noticed them in an ordinary book; but the fact is that the work is so well done that we feel disappointed that absolute excellence has not been attained. The translator has set himself the task of introducing his author to the English public, and although he might have been more presentable in a more thoroughly English dress, there is still a great charm in the unwonted Oriental garb in whiclh he appears, and which conveys, after all, a better idea of his nationality. WVhen we reflect thiat one of the world's greatest poets-for such Hdfiz undoubte'dly was-is now for the first time made accessible to the English reader, wo cannot overrate the limportance of the volume befora iil
M.r. Arnold's "" Indian Song of Songs "" is a mort unpretending but scarcely less remarkable book. It is a translation from the Sansscrit idyll, the Gita Gov!%ida of Jayadeva, in which the superiority of heavenly and intellectual beauty to the attractions of earthly loveliness and sensual pleasures is treated under tlo allegory of a love tale. Krishna, an incarnation of Vishniu, is found at the opening of the poem lavishin'g his affections upon some beautiful sheepherdesses to tlhe neglect of Radba, the personification of intellectual and moral beauty. At last tbe chlrms of the legitimate nmistress, depicted in very glowving colours by the author of the original, succeed in makinz an inpression on Krishna's Aieart, and he is ultimately won back to rectitude and happiness. The poem is rendered into very musical English verse, and, although rather a paraphrase than a strictly literal translation, it evinces a thorough kuorledge of the language of the original. The metre is varied for each different section of the work, and a pleasing variety is thuis obtained. The sentiment of tho poem is tender and noble. Here, for instance, is a verse which, changing only the proper name of the being invoked, would not be out of place in Christian bymn-book:-
""Ob, may Hari fill each soul ""As these gentle verses roll,
""Telling of tho anguish borme
'4 By '-indremd ones asunder toet "" Oh, may flari nuto each
4"" All tbe lore of loving teach,
""Al the pain and sll the bliss; ""Jayadevs, prayeth this !""
The title, "" Song of Songs,"" isan appropriate one, for just as the Christian Church attaches a spiritual interpretation to the slir has-shirim of Solnmon, so this emphatically erotic poem is undoubtedly intended to teach high and pure moral truths. The volume, a handy little octave, contains also some minor original poenks, founded on Oriental legends, which display, as might be expected from their author, considerable power both of conception and execution. "" The Rajpoot's Wife,"" a Hindoo story suggestie of the history of Judith and Holofernes, is a very striking production, both in the metre and the mode of working out the plot. So, too, is "" The Rajah's Ride,"" which re;ountslhow a chiettain of Sindh, after languishing for along time in captivity with bis Moslem foes, was made to ride an intractable holse in the hopes that he woulld be disuraced and killed. Instead, however, of meeting with such a fate, he lea s tho wall of the fort, outrides his pursuers, and pays a visit to his faithful wife. Arrived lhome however, he scornss to comnmit so mean an act as horse-stealing, and lieedless of the consequences rides back to Lahore and delivers up the steed to his Maflometian captor, who generously gives hinm his freedom and a magnificent present besides. We cannot give higher praise to thiR poem than to say that it can bear the introduction of such a verse as the following, without producing an incongruous or ludicrous effect
Sent lim back, with dances and drum""Wah ! rmy l:ajak Runjeet Dehu,
""To Chunda Kour and his Juinmoo home-
"" With ! wah ! futtee !-wah gooroo ""'
It would have been better for Mr. Arnold's re. putation for Oriental scholarship had the last poem in the book been oimitted, or, at least, had he not yielded to ]his evident penchant for introducing snatches of verse in the original language. The story on which the verses are based is founid as an exercise in a well-knowu elementary Aratbic grammar, and tells how the Caliph Mohtasiini, whil. raising his glass to his lips, was informied that a certain Arab lady was takeni captive by a Ureek lord. Tlho captor, after treating his prisoner with unany indignities, at last smote her on tho face, and when she called on tlhe Caliph for aid, replhed tauntingly, thatlie would never coine to her rescue but on a piebald lhorse. On hearing this, MIohtnsim ordered out.a band of lheroes, mounted on 300,000 piebald steeds, rescued the lady, slew the barbarian, and then, and not till then, quenched his tllirst from the vessel whlich he had before raised to his lips and set down untasted. One or twvo sentences of Arabic whwich are given in the course of thle poem aro miserably misquoted, whether by the author's fault or that of his printer we knowv not. On the whole, however, the work is a very pleasinig one, and may be cordially recommended to any one who wishes to make himself acquainited with the sentiments and legendary lore of our Indian fcUowsubjects.

II.
'_he third series of "" Songs of Two Worlds,"" by ""A New Vriter"" (Henrv S. King and Co., London. 1875), is not unworthy of its predecessors. It presents the same command of metre and diction, the same contrasts of mood, the same grace and sweetness, perhaps the same strength and weaeness, ns the volumes which have already met with so favourable a reception. WYe confess the title is still a puzzle to us. Perhaps it wvas meant by its author to be an enigma with more than one solution, and, as Ave have no taste for that kind of guessing, we prefer to let it go unsolved. ""A NeL\w Writer "" owves some of the popularity his poems have achieved to the way in wvhich they harmonize wFith some passing mood of contemporary thought. The perplexities and strivings of modern thought and the bewildering contrasts of muodern life are the chief theuies of "" A New Writer."" Subjective poetry, to borrow the useful phrase of a criticism now almost obsolete, is, perhaps, the most difficult poetry of all to treat wvith supreme success, and the poetry of "" Songs of Two Worlds "" is intensely subjective. Nevertheless, though it needs a master hand to handle such themes with perfect success so as to bring light to the world from the smoke and heat of the struggle, it behoves us to do justice to the "" New Writer's "" merits in the line of work he has chosen for bimself. He has ample command of musical and vigorous diction, and of varied and skilful rhythm. It is true that in "" Evensong,"" the most considerable poem in the present volume, the line of demarcation between philosophic and poetic diction is not very clearly observed, and the thought is not completely fused in the poetry. Thus, such a line as "" How atom with atom at first fortuitously combined "" is an ingenious and praiseworthy attempt to fit philosophy to metre, but it reminds one rather of the drearyspeculations ef Lucretius than his magnificent bursts of poetry. The poem, howvover, as a whole, Is vivid and suggestive, if not entirely satisfying. But to take a comrmon and familiar object and show forth its ideal side with graceful skill and delicate imagination, to see the poetry and the pathos of daily life is the special powver which "" A New Writer "" possesses, and this he enjoys to a degree wvhicb poets of greater range might envy. In a former volume a poem called "" The Organ Boy "" struck this note with considerable force and power. It is, perhaps, still the best example of "" A New
Vriter's"" special and intrinsic poetic faculty. In the "" Org,an Boy "" the contrast between Italian
ivilization, ancient and modern, andthat of England iS finely wrought. Somethling of the same note is struck again in the "" Street Children"" of the present volume, but we fear it shares the proverbial fate of repetitions. Many of ""A New WYriter's"" siighter poems are reaUy songs, and could they find a sympathetic composer would afford a welcome relief to the vapid monotony of ordinary drawing-room music. It is ditlicult to see why amidst the inexhaustible wealth of English verse so much trash should be thought good enough for musical treatment and tolerated both in pu'Dlic and private. On the whole it cannot be denied that ""A New WVriter"" has won a definite position among contemporary JEnglish poets. If we cannot as yet place him in the front rank, yet he has written enough to showv that he has powers which may some dav make good his claim to it. At present, it is true, his themes lack variety, and his treatment independence,but lie is always thoughtful as well as graceful, and frequently vivid.
*"" it and Humour,"" by the late genial editor of IPunch (Bradbury, Agnew, and Co., London, 1875), is a collection of verses which have from tiue eto time appeared in that periodical. ""It shouldbe borne in mind,"" says Mr. Shirley Brooks's son in a brief preface, "" how these poems were written. There was no time for choosing of epithets, for weighing of phrases, for polishing of liiies; there was no time to wait for favourable seasons and conditions, they had to bo written from week to week in whatever bodily pain or mental grief their author might chance to be. Many of the epigrams in this volume which seem the most higghly polished were written off impromptu,and even of the longer poems -to give an example of the rapidity wvith wvhich they were produced-' The lRime of the Ancient Alderman' was begun and finished in an hour."" It is inevitable in a volume of verse composed in such a manner that there should be much which has but an ephemeral interest. But the volume wvill serve pleasantly to beguile an idle hour, and it will hereafter be of real value to the student of conteinporary manners and politics. Unfortunately, there is nothing which so quickly loses its interest as occasional verse of a humorous cast. The secret of its success lies in its hitting the mood of the passing moment, and its essence is so volatile that it evaporates in a few days. It is no slight testimony to the vigour and versatility of Shirley Brooks's peculiar talent that so much that he wrote retains a permanent interest, and will bear reading again whenthe special occasion which called it forth is forgotten. It is impossible to characterize briefly the contents of a volume so varied, or to single out special parts for commendation where so much deserves it, but the writer seems to us especially felicitous in parodies and brief epigrams. "" The Baby in the House "" must lhave hit Mr. Coventry Patmore very hard. "" Gladstone Unmasked "" is so clever a parody of "" the Spanish Cloister "" that Mr. Browning himself must be almost inclined to forgive it. Mr. Tennyson has more reason to complain. ""H ome they brought her hipdog dead "" is amusing enough, but the exquisite song it mimics is scarcely a fit subject for such a travesty. The volume contains several sets of verses of a more serious type. It often fell to Shirley Brobks's lot to have to write the "" In MIemoriam "" verses in which Punch from time to time records the nation's mourning for distinguished men, and he acquitted }iumself of the difficult task with unfailing grace and feeling. It cannot be denied that there is much in this entertaining volume vhich reads rather flat, and though the editor boasts of the wealth of his material, -we are not sure that ho would not have exercised a sound discretion in rejecting a good deal of wlhat he has retained. Flat champagne is not an exhilarat-
ing oeverage, anr wlen Jokes are stale, they need more than ephemeral wit to carry them ofi Still, c.onsidering the circumstances of hurry and pressure under wvhich many of these poeins were produced the reader will probably be disposed to judge the least attractive of them as leniently as possible. Versatility, promptitude, abundant wit, an unfailing command of varied metre, a fertility and aptitude of allusion, and unflagging good-humour are qualities rarely found in suclh profusion as that exhibited byShirley Brooks. Mlany of his poems are as amusing now as when they were first penned, and this is much to say of jeux d'eaprit which were all prompted by a passing occasion; even if some of them haye lost their flavour, they were probably quite as highly appreciated on their furst appearance. It is only just to add that, though his satire is often keen and his wit sharp, he is always generous, and the volume does not contain a single bitter or ill-natured sarcasm.
The "" Poetical Worka of SydneyDobell"" (Smith, Elder, and Co., London, 1875), have been published in a collected form, with an Introductory Notice and Memoir by Professor Nichol, of Glasgow. They cannot be strictly reckoned among recent poetry, for Sydney Dobell died a year ago, in his 51st year, and, as his biographer tells us, "" his literary labours may be said to have well nigh closed with his 30th."" But this is the first collected edition of his poems that has appeared, and in their present form they make a fresh appeal to a new generation of readers. What the result of that appeal may be it is very difficult to say. There can be no doubt that the author of "" The Roman "" was a poet, and a poet of very high quality. Had he fulfilled in later years the promise he exhibited in his first poem, there is no living poet whom he might not have rivalled. In "" The Roman "" there is vigour, originality, melody, dramatio force, tenderness, and political fervour enough to make the reputation of half-a-dozen minor poets. It has its faults, it is truo; it is immature in conception perhaps, and somewhat monotonous in structure, and the blank verse is disfigured byS the tuo frequent use of the eleven-syllable line ; but it is undoubtedly a work of power and genius, and alone would vindicate Sydney Dobell's claim to a recognized place among Enalish poets. Of ""Balder"" it is more difficult to speal- decidedly; it may be as Professor Nichol declares, a poem for poets, but it is undoubtedly a tax on the patienco of ordinary mortals. We may be permitted- to rejoice that it was never completed on the scale which the author projected. Its structure bears the same relation to an ordinary drama that a Dutch laudscape, without figures, where the monotony of swindmills is only brokeni by the mhonotoug of poplar avenues,
hoar:to tinarv acener.-It is an in terminable monot
logue varied only by ""pauses"" and ""interludes of music "" (left, no doubt, respectively to the discre.ion and imagilatiOn of the reader), and not very mUelOdious SOllgs. It contains noble passages anud splendid hoists of poetry it is true ; but thes3 are bot enough to make a great poem. Perhaps the best criticism on it iz that *written by the autlior himself :-"" Poetry, by w.hatsoever other qualities it be distinguished, has this common characteristic -that it will live. AWhether, therefore, this work be poetry or not, I think its assailant may equally claim our condolence. On the one hand lie assaults it to no detriment but his own ; ou the other, I liave imposed on him the labour of killing wvhat, if it can die, should never have been born."" Perhaps it is not unfair to add that whein a ccrpse is found, thepresumptiun is equally strong-infavour of suicide as in that ut mnurder. "" Balder"" was not very successful at its first appearance, though the author of "" The lRoman"" was a man whose 'aterary reputation was sufficient to sec-rre him a swecis d'estiine at least. If it could not live when it wvas first published we fear its vitality is not likely to be increased by age. There is truth and force in Professor 2Nichol's judgment of his friend's poem. "" Every part of a consummate 'work of art ought, like the hand or foot of a finished org-anism, to bear evidence of its purpose. Did the ' Inferno' stand by itself it would still have a terrible unity. Mr. Dobell's tragedy is not only incomplete, but confusedly chaotic."" We fear th-at the admiration and even adulation of his' friends to which Professor Nichol's memoir bears abundant witness, may have been injurious to the developmient of Sydney Dobell's genius. He was educated at home, and pursued his mature studies under no better gsudance than Iis own. He lived apart from the great world, and tho singular charm of his personal character seems to have disarmed the wholesome criticism of those who surrounded him. Hence he never learnt to correct Iiis faults, and gave the rein to a wayward, and, perhaps, somevhat morbid genius. Balder"" contains the materials of a great poem no doubt, and ""The Roman"" very nearly is one. But the uncorrected faults of the earlier poem are reproduced and multiplied in the later. The theme of "" Balder"" is less interesting and its treatment is more prolix and monotouous. Thehalf of it is certainly greater than the wvhole, and a tenth of it would be more likely to live than either. The poems entitled "" Sonnets on the War,"" and "" Enoland in Time of War,"" are just what might have been expected from the author of "" Balder"" and "" The Roman."" They contain much that is attractive, much that is indifferent, and not a little that is positively repulsive. If their better strains provoke an unfavourabie comparison with the poet who wvrote ""M Milton, thou shouldst be living at this hour,"" the parallel is still more to the disadvantage of Sydney Dobell in their wreakest. parts. It is a pity Sydney Dobell's friends were not ashamed to reprint "" The Orphan's Song,"" ""W Vind,"" ""Farewell,"" and others, which do not seem to us to rise above the level of doggrel. Mr. Dobell's latter years were saddened by failing health, and his public literary efforts ceased when he was little over 30. It is possible that his early poetical impulse wvas quenched in suffering, and that he had not the patience to undertake the task of revising his poems, and rejecting those which a mnaturer taste must have condemned. WVe cannot but think that the editors of the present volume would have been -wise had they su pressed some of these poems; at least, they would have raised a more enduring monument to their friend's memory. Some poets live in selections when the bulk of their worlks has passed into oblivion. There is mucll of Sydney 3obell's work that deserves to live in this way, but there is not a little that his greatest admirers might -well wish to be forgatten. It is difficult to believe that the same man was the author of the best and the worst poems which these two volumes contain. They are a striking proof that real genius is not inconsistent with the most childish and wvaywvard taste.
M1r. NVilliama Bell Scott, painter and critic, as well as poet, has collected and republished his ""'Poems"" (London, Lon,,mans, 1875), inavolnue ""illustrated by 17 Etchings by the author and LAlma Tadema."" Likie Sydney Dobell, MIr.. bott is good enough to give us a canon for deter-mining the value of his wvork:-"" 19'o external or adventitious-merits, nor even purely intellectual qualities, can altogether determine the value of poetry. It must affect us like music or wvine, but it must certainly have wvisdom, like an instinct, directing it from vithin. Every excellent poetic work has a physiognomy of its own, an organic character of its o-n, the possession or non-possession of which the world will sooner or later sympathetically determine."" This is a bold appeal to the judgment of the world, and we are not quite sure that the verdict will satisfy the appellant. There are many names transmitted to posterity, says a witty French critic, which never reach their address, and it is just possible that posterity may have very little to say about M1r.
Scotts - -oems."" -ixternal and adventitious merits, to use his own test, they, no doubt, have in abundance. They are rhythmical, varied, picturesque, vivid, but -we cannot find in them much of the stuff of which immortal poems are made. As for "" wisdom,"" we are not quite sure that we understand what Mlr. Scott means by it. We look for such a quality in a didactic poem, but it has not much place in a ballad or a descriptive piece. WVe certainly look in vain for it, in its ordinary sense, in such a poem as "" Tuie Duke's Funeral ;"" in this poem, wshich stramngely enough comes underthe heading "" Studies from Nature,"" and in the sonnet "" On certain Critics at the beginningof tho Century,"" there is, in our judgment, neither wisdom nor dignity. Mr. Scott is more successful in Lis "" Ballads "" than in the rest of his work ; his more serious and, so to speak, personal poems leave the reader cold and unumoved, but the B.3allads are vigorous and musical. Mlr. Scott felt early the influence of that revived medi.evalism, wfhich, like tbe earlier Romanticism in France, took so strong a hold of our leading poets and artists a quarter of a century ago. The Ballads are a product of this influence; if they bear the marks of arevivalin a sliaht lack-of spontaneity and simplicity, they are skilful imitations, though even here Mr.
bcott's eltorts nave been surpassed by the more finished performance of his friendl, M!r. D. G. Rossetti. Ve could wish Air. Scott had been more sparina in tha use of obscure and irrelevant burdens in some of his poems of this character. They serve, no doubt, to exhibit the poet's sldll, but wre doubt if the reader is not gonerally tempted to skip them and to get at the drift of the poem undisturbed by such troublesome interruptions. In Mr. Rossetti's "" Sister Helen "" the burden is so wrought into tahe texture of the poem that it enhances its weird force, and gives it unity and purpose. But Mr. Scott's burdens are too often grotesque acnd unmeaning, or, at least, their meauing is so far-fetched and obscure that they mar instead of aiding the effect of the poems in which they occur. I'oets addicted to ballads with burdens should bear in mind the immortal parody of C. S. C.-"" Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese ;"" the memory of this homely line has spoilt the fortunes of imany a pretentious ballad. We cannot call 2r. Scott's first-rate poems, but the reader will find in this vol-ume much melodious verse, muchgraceful description,some line reflective sonnets, and little of positive failure. The attractiveness of the volume is considerably enhanced by the illustrations. I1r. Scott's Jkijll as an artist is well known, and that of Mr. Tadema needs no commendation from us. The three etchin's of ""Love Originating Art"" ""An Old Chest,'? and ""Pygmalion "" are quite chirming. Mr. Scott tells us that MIr. Tadema's illustrations are his first efforts with the etching point, and he favours us wivith his own opinion as to their success. We hesitate to differ from a critic whose judgment is so much respected, but we seem to de'ect in Mr. Tadema's drawings some traces of his unfamiliarity with his instrument. "" The Great Sphinx "" is very fine, but "" Fair Rosamond "" is stiff and somewhat ungainly, the background of "" Eric aud tne Waterwitch"" is sbapeless and confused, while parts of "" Lady Janet"" are grotesque and almost hideous. Nevertheless, the illustrations, as a whole, are so far above the level of ordinary works of the ldnid as to belongtoadifferentcategory.lVhatever opinion may be formed of Mr. Scott's merits as a poet, his gifts as an artist, and those of his friend,will render his volume acceptable.
"" The Ship in the Desert"" is the title of a new poem of the Far West, by Ir.Joaquin Miller (London, Chapman and Hall, 1875). The author is well and favourably known to the public Irom his earlier works "" Songs of the Sierras"" and "" Songs of the Sun Lands."" America has produced several poets and a good deal of verse, but with the exception, perhaps,of Walt Whitman, none of its native singers bear a more genuine impress of its soil and life than lMr. 3,Miller. %Vhitnman is the noet of democracy
andl the future, 1.r. lVliler of pioneers and thprairies. The "" Ship in the Desert"" is a series of transcripts of the sueeiery and life of the Westein deserts, strung together on a sli_ht and rather ubscure story. lt is evident froim the preface that Mr.I Miller does not set much store by tbe narrative part of hiis litest wvork. * Thle world,"" he says, ""w will have its way, anid, like a spoilerl child, demands a tale."" His ow-n taste is for "" sceines and descriptions of a inigity land of mystery andl wild and savage graudeur"" as lie fnds ther on the banks of the hidgher Nlissouri,-the Rockv Mountains, and the plhaiis of Upper California, the weird and desert craule of the Aztec race. Btnt a poemn canl scarcelv be made up wholly of descriptions, and AIr Miller has shown in his former works that he can fit his descriptions of the scenery he loves wvith appropriate motives of human feeling and passion. Perhaps the pictures of the scenery he dascribes are enhanced bv the dfeampv and unsolved mystery of the tale he tells ; but we agree vith lhim that it is but a "" slight thread of fiction,"" and though not inappropriate it mi?ht have been wrought out nmore fully and developed to greater purpose. However this may be, 1r. MIiller's descriptions are fresh, vigorous, poetic ; they bear the stamp of personal and loving observation; as we have said, they are genuine prod nets of a gennune American minse. 'The following brilliant picture from the preface, vwhich will remind many readers of Walt Whitman by its concentration and directness, is alumost a summary of the poem
The frail and baffeted rafts on the river, the women and children huddled together, the shouts of a thousand men as they swam vith the bellowing cattle; the cows in the stormy stream, eddying, whirling, spinning about, calling to their young, tkeir bright lhorns shining in the sun. . . . The wild men waitinO on the other side, painted savages leaning silent on their bows, despising our weakness, opening a way, letting us pass on to the unknown distances, where they said the sun and moon lav dowrn together and brought forth the star,. . . . The long and wvinding lanes of waggons, the graves by the wryside, and women'weeping together as they passed on. Then hills, then plaiLns,palched lands hlke Syria, dust, and ashes, and alkali, cool streams with vwoods, camps by night, great wood fires in circles, tents in the contre, like C:esar's battle camps, painted men that passed hke shadows, Showers of arrows, the wild beasts howling from the hll.t
'These are sonme of the scenes wlhich MInr Miller describes with considerable force and poetic insight. I3is feeling for the Wlrestern world is genuine and intense; and there is, perhaps, no finer passage in the volume than that wherein he commeemorates the forgotten labours and
""The still endurance of the rude, unpolished sons of
solitucde.""
The pioneers of Western civilization. His versification is flowing and graceful, though occasionaLy disfigured by a too uncouth colloquialism.
"" ' She sleeps uncommon sound,' he said,""
is a specimen of the rare freaks of imperfect taste in an otherwise very striking poem.
F'rom the Far West to the Far East the transition is easy, and the joiuney from the Pacific seaboard to the shores of China is a common one. It is not often that China furnishes a theme to an English poet, but in ."" Yu-Pe-Ya's Lute"" (London, Macmillan, 1874), MIrs. Augusta Webster has sought her inspiration from this uncommon source. The tale is founaed on a Chinese legend, translated under the title of "" Le Luth Brse,"" by BE Pavie. The story is very slight, and loses much of its delicate charm when reduced to simple prose. YuPe-Ya is a high-born and wealthy noble, and a consumunate master of the mystery of music and the lute. In his travels he meets with a peasant, TseKy, whose musical skill is revealed by the mystic sympathy of the lute. Yu-Pe-Ya at first scorns his lowvly craft-fellow, but soon discovers that his command of the instruiment and its lore is not inferior to his own. Thereupon a friendship springs up between the two, and Yu-Pe-Ya invites Tse-ky to accompany him to the great city ; the latter refuses, as his aged parents are supported by his labour, and the new friends part, Yu-Pe-Ya promising to come back shortly and seek out his brother in song. After a year he returns, and as the summons of lds lute brings no response from Tse-Ky, he sets out to seek his dwelling. On his way he meets an old man, Lao-Pay, who turns out t, be Tse-Ky's father, and from him he learns that Tse-Ky is dead. LaoPay conducts him to Tse-Ky's grave, over which Yu-Pe-Ya breaks his theasured lute, and then he returns sorrowfally to the city, having taken upon himself, as a pledge of his brotherhood for Tse-Ey, the burden of supporting his lost friend's parents. Such is an outline of the story told with skill and delicacy bv Mrs. 'Webster. Ve hate here an Oriental theme, and the motives it deals wvith seem s;trange enough to WVestern ideas, but -IMrs. WVebster has managed to invest it with a tender interest. So attempt is made to makce it an accurate transcript of Chinese sentiment or life, nor to deck it vwith what is commonly called local colouring. This is, perhaps, wise. Chineselife and manners are so unfamiliar to our literature thiat to transplant them without modification is the -work rather of science than of poetrv. But Doetry is -well eDtitled to take a striking theme from any source, and treat it according to its own fancy. This is -what Mrs. Vebster has avowedly done. "" Yu-Pe-Ya's Lute "" is slight, but it is graceful and attractive. The versification is very smooth and sweet, and several of the songs-especially "" WVaiting, waiting ""-are beautifuL Taken for vhat it is, a simple treatment of an exotic theme, with no claim to be called a great or original poem, "" Yu-Pe-Ya's Lute "" achieves a success which is denied to many more pretentious efforts. It is a quaint and pleasing trifle, all the more attractive that it afibrds at least a glimpse into a life and literature which to maost English readers is as strange as that of another

Null,Poetry And Photography.*,The Times,1875-Feb-01,"London, England","YOETRY AND PHOTOGAPEY.+
In this beautiful volume Mrs. Camer n ha,; given to the public, in their original size, the plates which, at the desire of the poet she prepared for the illustration of the Peoples3 Edition of his Idylls. In that work the vigour and grace of those photographs are much marred by the necessary reduction of the plates to a cabinet form. AIIr Camueron has, accordingly, determined that these illustrations of Tennyson should appear in a separate volume in their untouched state, and in this determination she has been strengthened by the desire of the poet himself as wel as of many artists. It has been Nlrs. Cameron's ambition in illustrating Tennyson to catch as far as possible the ideal character of the subjects, and, as Milton says of mUusic, so to treat tho pnet's noble conceptions that her art too might he ""married to immortal verse."" This principle of illustration may be well exemplified in the case of Artiur himself, theflos cyguin, "" the blameless King."" Any oue who u-ill turn to the two illustrations in this volumo in which the E ing appears wvil recognize at once the mythical and, at the same time, spiritual expression of his face,fitly embodyinTennyson's own declaration .that Arthur "" moved like a conscience 'mnong his knights."" How difficult such artictic treatment of a great subject is, and, at the same time,how severe Mrs. Cameron's judgment has been on her own attempts, is proved by the fact that befora satisfactory photographs of these 12 plates were pioduced no few,er than 200 plates Mwere taken. Such fastidiotis perseverance brings indeed its owln rev;ard in the consciousness that nothing has been left undone to make these illustrations perfect. May their success encourage others to enter on the same field wvith something of the same genius and spirit; in that case we nmay hope to see poetry illustrated vwith nmore reality and life than are to be found in the meagre attempts hitherto produced.
Turning- now to the plates tbem selves, the frontispieca of the volane is a lively representation of Tenny:on himself, which gives the character of tbo poet in all his serious thoughtfulness, ""full of noble things."" Next comes a scene from ""Gareth and Lynette,"" where in a care-
""Sir Gareth drank and a.te, an all hm life "" Past into sleep.""
h7nd Lrynette, watching himI. savs
""Seein I not as tender to him ""Asoanymother Ay,but sucha ono
* s all day long hath rated at her cha
"" And vext his tiay, but blesses him asleep.""
In rendering this scene T4rs. Cameron-us, indeedi, it is but fair to say she has been all throuah the volume-has been most fortunate in her models. Nothing can exceed the beauty of the slumbering knight, nor tho tender grace of the maiden whho leans over him and touches him gently with her hand. :No. 2 is a well-known scene from ""Geraint and ,Enid,"" whe.e she arrays herself in ""a faded silk, a faded mantle, and a faded veil,"" at her husband's bidding. We know nothing in photographic manipulation that surpasses the skill and grace with wvhich the white tints are produced in this plate, a feat which, we may observe, is repeated in No. 6, ""Lancelot and Elaine,"" perhaps the finest plate in the volume, as well as in No. 9, where we see the guilty Queen, and how she-
""hose again,
""And mnoved about her palace l)roud and pale.""
Returning to the plates in their order, in No. 4, a dark plate, we behold hnid us she touches her lute, aud sings of Fortune and her wheel, alike careless of her smile or frown,
""y ornsan is man and master of his fatea.
In No. D we see howr the ""' lic3some Vivien "" sits on Merlin's knee,and clinging to him combs hisbeard-
I And such a beard as youth gone out ""EHad left in ashes "" -
where the full, supple form of the wily maiden and her material face are brought into ful contrast wvith the full white beard and flowing silver locl-s of the aged enchanter. No. ( is a scene from the same Idyll, where Vivien has had her will and heard the charm, and Merlin lies as dead in tho hollow oak , "" lost to life and use and name and fame."" In this case we may mention that the hollow oak in which Merlin is represented us sunk to sleep is one which stands in the grounds of the Poet himself at Farringford, near Freshwater, in the Tile of Wight, near which place Mr Cameron heraelf resides. Nos. 7 and S are two plates,from the Idyll of ""Lancelot and Elaine."" In the first ""the lily maid of Astolat"" is represented as guarding Lancelot's shield; and in the second she sits in hopeless love in her tower after the shield was gone, and mado and sang her "" little"" song of Love and Death. We have already expressed our opinions of the first of these plates. lNo. 9 is taken from the "" Holy Urail,"" wlhere ""the wan sweet maiden,"" having shorn her hair and made it into a belt for Sir (ialahad, binds it round him with the words-"" 1, maiden, round thee, maiden, bind my belt.' The pure, passionless faces of the spirituial lovers are rendered with a sober grace, wbich is a fitting preparation for Nos. 10 and 11, both taken from "" Guinevere,"" the first when, as we have already said,shemoved about her paLace proad and pale, thinking herself slighted by Lancelot; the second where, whon Lancelot still lingered in spite of the Queen's warning-
"" Oh lancelot, if thou love mne, get theo hence,"" and they met once more-
"" To meet
"" And part for ever. Passion-pale they mcf "" And greeted.""
This photograph, which represents the passionate greeting of the guilty pair just before their detection by Arthur, many will think the fineBt in the book. It probably is tle finest in grouping and composition; but for ourselves wev adhero to oiur old love and admire Elaine the most. Lnst of all come Nos. 12 and 13, in the first of which wa see Arthlur as he parted from (juinevere, and she could not see his face,
"" WVhich then was as an angel's, but she saw.
"" Wet with the mists and smitten by the lights,""
the Dragon of the great Pendragonship, which ho bore upon his helmet for a crest,
- ""BIlaze, maldng aUllthe night a strcam of fire,""
-vhile in the mist her husband seemed the phantom of a giant-"" moving ghost-like to his doom."" In lNo. 13 we behold the King, as he is denicted in "" the Passing of Arthur"" wlhere he has come out of his last disastrous battle betrayed by those of his owvn house, his crest all but shorn off, the fiery DAragon a mee stmnp, the rings of his mail torm nnd rent, and, his eyes glaring before they are glaed in death, and sorely smitten though he is and sick at heart at being thus done to death by his own kindred, declares-
""'Kin"" am I, whatsoever be their ery,
""'And'one last act of Kinghood shall thou see, ""'Yet ere I pass,' and uttering this, the ing ""2MIade at the n.;3^""
We sincerely hope that this artistic volume may be as profitable to Mdrs. Cameron as its preparation has been laborious, We had nearly forgotten to add that it is dedicated, by permission, to the Princess Imperial of Prussia, whose love for art and generous encour-agemeut of -it both in England and Germany are well-known.

Null,Mr. Matthew Arnold's New Poems.*,The Times,1867-Oct-31,"London, England","MRI. AATMAZEW ARNOLD'S NBW POEMS.+
A critic does not often vwrite poetry. But Mr. 3Iatthewr Axrnold was a poet before ho was a critic. Iai his criticisnms-whether this be to their praise or blaae-he is still something of a poet, and in his poetrY he is aiuch of a critic. Thero was a time *hen he sang for singing's sake; and the melodv of tome of those strainus is still pleasant to tlle ear. But his ""Shepherd's Holyday"" has, he laments been lost many a year; and if ever he wvrites now it 2slr-nifestly because he has something to tell.
z!Ldtama on Empedocles,-the bard,the orator,the Dl1aster of the great sophist, Gorgias, the philo60pher who vvaudered over the earth subduing naature, whether by science or by magic, the patriot who expelled tyrants, and might have been himself a king, now worshipped as a god, now an exile,and the story of his mysterious end on Etna, comnmences this long-defefred volume. it is all attempt to showv that Thought mayprove a taskmaster as cruel as Sense. Empedocles, compelledto fly the debasing society of mankdin on pain of absence fromI himself, had.sought refuge with Apollo inhis moonlit peaks and caverns. But the votary of the God, "" youthful but scornful,"" and "" intolerably severe,"" finds that he has escaped the slavery of sense only to have wandered far from his own soul, to have become-
"" Thought's slave and dead to every natural joy-
. . . . a living man no more,
"" Nothing but a devouring flame of thought, "" But a naked, eterually restless mind.""
He will not return and seek shelter from himself in the companionship of men,whom he denounees as a people of children, who asked of him, the inspired sage, not wisdom, btt ""sDells to mutter,"" and listen gladly to the sophist brood which overlays the last spark of man's consciousness with words. And his pitiless solitde nmaddens him. Bandied between the two he longs for rest, to be resolved into hsis ""well-tried friends and ministers,"" the elements, fiom which he came. But on the brink of death he pauses, terrified by his own reasoning, that, when death comes, the mind, the thought, if we have suffered them to be the master part of us, will, since they, unlike the body, can have no parent element to return to, forbid the material parts from returning to their several elements -to earth, wvater, fire, air:-
But we shall still be in them (miad and thought), and
they in us,
""And we sball be the strangers of the world,
""And4hey will bo our lords as they arc now; "":And keep us prisoners of our consciousness, ""And never let us clasp and feel the All
""'Bat through their fornis, anud modes, andstifling veils. "" And we shaU be unsatisfied as now,
""And we shall feel the agony of thirst,
"" The ineffaolo longing for the life of life
""Baffled for ever; and stiu thought and mind
""Will hurrv us with them on their homeless march.""1
For such he believes to be the doom of those who have not reverenced the harmony of their nature, but have let one part play thle tyrant over the soul, and so, becoming isolated from the general universe, have fallen away
'nlto some bondage of the flesh or mind,
"" Some sloughl of sense, or some fantastic maze
"" Fored by the im erious lonely thinking power ;"" who have, in short, Teen disloyal to their
""i Oew only true deep-buried selves,
' Being one wvith which we are one with the whole world."" We confess to rather grudging the prominence and space assigned by the author to this very undramatic drama. Yet the conception of Empedocles is fine, though not sufficiently beaten out; and there is a ringing sweetness in the contrast of the sombre complainings of the old !self-doomed prophet on the charred, blackened, melancholy waste above, with the joy9us music, far down in the greon and dewy glades, of the boy Callicles, ""the sweetest harp-player in Catana,"" who has followed him through the night to chann away with his lyre the gloom which, 'with a poet's subtle intuition, he appreciates more truly than the master's wisest disciples, but fancies might be soothed away, like his own, by the mere spectacle of "" the lovely mountainpaths""
""What mortal could be sick or sorry here 1""
The two several utterances, seer's and harper's, in their rise and fall, seem to melt together into a dialogue; and the Tennysonian grace of the minstrel's tale of Cadmus and Harmonia in their Illyrian glen, or Typho writhing under Etna, and letting the seastream wander through his hair, compensates for the twenty-three preceding pages, through which Empedocles has been "" accompanying himrself in a soleman manner on his harp,"" the merit of which, whatever else it may be, Mr. Arnold will acknowledge is hardly the merit of poetrv.
The poem was printed some years ao, though soon withdrawn from circulation; and its real date is legible everywhere. Yet Mr. Arnold is justified in now issuing it as a "" new "" poem, by the very distinct unity of philosophical conception traceable between it and its later-born companions. There is, indeed, a sort of undesigned conthiuity running through all the poems in the volume, which gives them a- common interest independent of their different degrees of individual poetical merit. Everywhere we find marked the same impatience of isolation, ifi respect whether of physical or social existence, or of idceas. The fear of the Sicilian that, in the several e.lements of his being,he may be debarred after this life friom reunion with universal nature, takes the form, in the later poems, of a cravinig to be emancipated,at least in dying, from the local eddies of humani life, to be confronted alone with Nature, with
""The world which was era I was born,
""The wvorld which lasts wheon I am dead. ""Which never was the friend of one,
""Nor pronmised love it could n ot give, ""But lit for all its generous sunu
"" And lived itself, and made us live""and so at last
"" To feel the universe my home.""
The horror of Empedocles at being doomed to dwvell, "" far from my own soul,"" in a web of ideas spun by the inteUect, reappears later under the reiterated complaint that we Englishmen travel otir round of labour,
""And never once possess our soul ""Before we die.
The feeling of the need of living the life of the "" soul,"" that is of living in tlle whole and not only in part of our being,as it was the clue to the self-reproaches of the votary of Apollo for havina wasted his life in disputing with folly, so it is the motive of the poet's lament for his friend Arthur Clough, the mnonody on wvhom, under the pastoral name of Tliyrsis, is, perhaps, the most charming poem in the avolumwe, that
"" his piping took a troubled sound
"" Of storms that rage outside our happy grouud; "" He could not wait their passing.""
And there is the samne apology for all his taunts against the present for its absorption in the present, forits blind hopes and blind despairs. The soulr he teaches, is alone worth living, or fighting, or dying for. It isi the Palladium of human life.
"" Set where the upper streams of Simois flow
""Was the Palladium, high 'mid rock and wood; ""And Rector was in Ilium, far below,
""Aud fought, and saw it uot, but there it stood.
""It stood; and sun and moonshine rain'd their light ""On the pure columns of its glcn-built hall.
""Backward and forward roll'd the waves of fi7ht
""RoundTroy; but while this stood, Troy could not falL ""So, in its lovely moonlight, lives the soul.
""Mountains surround it, and sweet virgin air""Cold plashing, past it, crystal waters roll; ""We visit it by nioments, ah! too rare.
""Men will renew the battle in the lain
""To-morrow; red with blood will Xianthus be; Hector and Ajax will be there again, ""Helen will come upon the wall to see.
""Then we shall rust in shade, or shine in strife,
""And fluctuate 'thixt blind hopes and blind despairs, And fancy that we put forth aU our life,
""Asid never kuow how with the soul it fares.
""Still doth the soul, from its lone fastness high. Upon our life a rujin effluence send -
""And when it fails, fight as we will we die, And while it lasts we cannot vwhollv end.""
13ut, although thus a common ground for what may be considered the two divisions of the volume, is supplied by the idea, underlying both, of the harmaony of Nature in all its phases, and of man's duty to be loyal to his own "" deep-buried self, the soul,""
as the only meansof vindicatig his place in the general system, another positive element is imported n3 ~the later portion.viz., a demand for sympathy,- not only with the universe, but specially
with our fellowY man, a refusal to bel
""Alone elate "" While the world lies forlorn ""
a looking forward to a possible future flood which shall sweep men free from a dead doctrine, nnd, still more, the dawning of a sense of obligation
"" That end to help men gain:
"" Ono mnighty wave of thought and joy i""Lifting mankind amain.""
The negative side, however, is more strongly developed in the sentiment even of the later poems than the positive; even if much of what we have treated as positive may not itself from one poinit of
view be considered to be negative. Hardly a single poem except "" Calais Sands,"" and a Bonnet or two,
but has its cry against what is accepted. Mfen are told to battle, but against what is, ratlier than for what ought to be; and, even so, in the hope not to win victoryliving but dead, Mr. Arnold's Psalm of Life is a requiem:-
"" Creep into thv narrow bed,
""Creep, and let tiOmore be said !
'Vain thy onset! all stands fast;
Thou thyself must break at last. ""Let the long contention cease !
""Geese are swans, and swans are geese.
Let them have it how they will! ""Thou art tired ; best be still !
""They out-talk'd thee, hiss'd thee, tore thee. ""Bettermen fared thus before tlee; ""Fired their ringing shot and pass'd;
Hotly charged-and broke at last.
"" hageonce more, then, and be dumb i
'Let tevnictors, when they come, 'I ""When the forts of folly fall, ""Bind thy body by tke waIl,
This, itself no jubilant ode of triumph, is sung over the champions of truth; for otlier combatants, triumphant in their own way, in the battle of life, a dirge of admirable dreariness is- suggested by the text, "" What is it to grow old ?""-
It is-last stage of all.-
""When we are frozen up within, and quite ""'The phautom of ourselves
To hear the world applana the hollow ghost ""Which blamed the living man.""
England, more than all other nations, seems to Mr. Arnold, as we all know, to have lost the keynote of the scale of her destiny; and, lettin-
""Slow die out of her life
""Glory, and genius, and joy"":The wearyTitan ! with deaf
Ears and labor-dimm'd eyes, "" Regarding neither to right, "" or left, goes passively by.
Staggering on to her goal.""
But so, too, the whole world about us is to him a chaos, which--
'?ath reaUy neitber joy, nor love, nor light,
Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain; ""And we are here as on a darkling plain,
Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight, Where ignorant armies clash by night.""
With tolerance, which is not eclecticism (but which, if poets were not privileged, and he were on his trial before a tribunal of the orthodox for the heresies of this volume, would hardly serve him), he holds, indeed, that to believe in som religion, however credulously, is better than to believe in none; for, among religions,-
"" Which has not taught weak wills how much they can ? ""Which has not fall'n on the dry heart like rain? Which has not cried to sunk, self-weary man, ""Thon must be born again?""
But, speaking in the name of Obermann, he cries that the religion of the world at largel is a collection of dry bones-that a storm has split up the old beliefs, on fragments of which men go tossing about the open ocean, unconscious that they are severed from the shore, and thatChirist is dead again.
""While we belioved, on earth he went, ""And open stood his grave.
""Men call'd from chamber, church, acd tent, ""And Christ was by to save.
""Now he is dead. Far hence he lie
'In the lorn Syrian town,
And on his grave, with shining eyes, ""The Syrian stars look down."")
Mr. Arnold reverences the living past 'le reverences even the faith in the dead past, by whose tomb its votaries watch and look for an awakening. He has not their hope; but he lingers by their side in sympathy with their grief. To the austere teachers of his youth, who ask-
""What dost thou in this living tomb?"" J He answers-
""Not as their friend or child I speak!
F ""But as, On some far northern stranld, T
"" Thinking of his own gods, a Greek
"" In pity ancd morllnful awre might stuand
"" Before seme fallen P.unie stone- ;
"" For both were faiths, audhoth are gpne. I ""Wandering between two worlds, one dead1 :
The other powerless to be born,
With uowhere yet to rest my head, ""Like these, on earth I wait forlorn.
Their faith, my tears, the world deride.; I come to shed them at their side.""
To gaze down upon the flood of to-day's dogmas and syatems rushing past, not to seek, but to wait the advent of, and be readv to accept, the new faith, bravely to stem the tide vwhen it rises and threatens to carry us along, but more gladly still to sit retired on our lonely hill in silence,-such, after all, is what Mr. Arnold's philosophy advocates. It does not, perhaps, seem a genial faith, this religion of tears; it does not seem a working-worlt's faith. Mr. Arnold is like a captain engaging sailors for his ship commissioned fora voyage under sealed sailing orders, which he himself may not open till in mid ocean. But the captaindoesman his ship; and Mr. Arnold will not be left to make his forlorn cruise alone. He need not fear-is it a fear or a hope ?-to be
"" Last of the race of them who grieve.""
M.any are ready like h im-there is no one who in certain moods is not-to suspect the equity of a generation's noisy judgments as to its own achievements in art and faith, and pause till
"" In the after-silence sweet,
Now strife is hush'd, our ears doth meet, Ascending pure the bell-like faLme ""Of this or that down-trodden name,
""Delicate spirits, pushed away
*In the hot-press of the noon-day.
""And o'er the plain, where the dead age ""Did its now silent warfare wage-
O'er that wide plain, row wrapt in glooin, ""Where many a splendour finds a tomb, ""hany spent fames and fallen mights-
The one or two immortal lights ""Rise slowly up into the sky
""'To shine there everlastingly,
Like stars over the bounding hill. ""The epoch ends, the world is stilL""
Mr. Arnold does not cease to be a critic when he assumes the poet. The "" Epilogue to Lessing's lLaocobn"" is an essay on the Fine Arts, in which the nobility of the verse does not blunt the keenness of the criticism.
We have space only for the description of thle musician's office in art:-
""Some pulse of feeling he must choose "". And its lock'd fount of beauty use,
"" And through the stream of music tell ""Its else unutterable spell -
""To choose it rightly is his part,
And press into its inmost heart. "" Mi.crere, Domine /
The words are utterd, and they flee. Deep is their penitential moan,
""lighty their pathos, but 'tis gone I
They have declared the sairit's sore
""Sore load, and words can do no more.
Beethoven takes them then-tbose two
""Poor, bounded words-and makes them new;
'Infinite makes them, makes them young, Transplants them to another tongue
Where they can now, withoutconstraint, Pour all the soul of their complaint, And roll adown a channel large
""The wealth divine they have in charge.
""Page after page of music turn,
And still they live and still they burn, ""Eternal, passion-fraught, and free""IMiserere Doinie l ""
A philosophical thinker, a critic, there hardly seems to be room left here for the poet. But Mr. Arnold is a poet, and not the less so that he criticizes Homer and theorizes on his countrymen's lamentable deficiency in Geist. This volume is no mere collection of psychological studies in verse. He has a poet's sensibility vibrating to the lightest touch. A burst of cynicism against social fetters and hypocrisies is interrapted by-
""I ask not each kind soul to keep
""Tearless when of my deatlh ho hears; ""Let those who will, if any, weep I
""There are worse plaues on earth than tears.""
In passing under review the legion of calamities that might have happened in a ten years' absence from one once loved, hiis fancy just suggests death, and in a moment the possibility becomes to his imagination a fact-
""Dead ?-and no warning shiver ran ""Across my heart, to say thy threadl
""Of life was cut, and closed thy span '
""Could from earth's ways that fiure sligbht
""Be lost, and I not feel 'twas so?
Of that fresh voice the gay deEght
""Fail from earth's air, aud I not know ? ""
Mir. Arnold is a master, too, in the poet's art of giving a local colouring to his fancies. Here is a picture from Kensington-gardens
""In this lone open glade I lie,
""Screen'd by deep boughs on either hand;
And at its head, to stay the eye,
""Those black-crowned red-boled pine trees stand, ""Birds here make son;, each bird has his,
Across the girdling city's hum.
""How reeu under the bougbsit is!
EHow thlick the tremulous sheep-cries come !""
The scenery of the ""Thyrsis"" is redolent of reality. We take almost at random:-
""Runs it not kere, the track by Chldsworth Farm,
""Up past tho wood, to where the elm-tree crowns
""T nill behind whose ridge tho sunset flamnes? ""The signal-olin, that looks on Ilsley Downs,

A guide-book could hardly portray more minutely, as it certainly would far less distinctly, the October afternoon's pilgrimagre to the Graude Chartreuse, the Alpine meado;vs soft suffused vith rain,the spectral vapours rushing past the limestone ?cars, and their ragged ""pines,"" and the Dead G stream far down in the ravine complaining with strangled sound.

It is nearly a hundred and thirty years since Gray made the samo autumnal journey. The almost savage solemnity of nature, the nine trees hanging from the crags, tho thunder of the torrent, the clouds, impressed hint witlh more awe than the younger poet could spare from the human spectacle, from the contemplation of these
"" Last of the peoplo who believe.""
But, on the other hand, the poet of the eighteenth century, if he saw Spirits and Death in the ravine below, remarlced no terrors, or mystery, or gloom within the Carthusians' ""solemn seats of holy pain"" above, but only "" extreme neatness,"" and ""C wonderful decency, with nothing of finery.""
Mr. Arnold's verse is aLways melodious,except by caprice, as in the strangely jarring close of ""-eine's Grave,"" and in a few heedless rhymes. He can be, however rarely, carelessly graceful, as in ""Calais Sands."" He achieves didactic stateliness, as in the ""Palladium."" The ""Epilogue to Lessing's Laocoon"" and ""Obermann Once Morc"" showY -what powers of expression are at his command. He has a choice of Dead Mlarches, but rather sombre, like Beethoven, than triumphant, like Handel; and he absolutely revels in elegies,-from the dainty melancholy oE "" Thyrsis,"" where the personality of the dead friend is nearlyhidden in the roses heapedover his memory, to the noble simplicity of ""Rugby Chapel,"" whiclh is rather a funeral sermon by a son over a father than an elegy, and the bitter-sweetness, the quality in which Mr. Arnold most delights, of "" Heine's Grave."" Whether he have the gift of depicting the movement of life (according to him the peculiar province of poetry among the arts), by wvhich, in the ""E]pilogzue to Lessing's Laocoon,"" he appears to signify a sympathetic intuition and power of representation of the shifting currents and groupings of life, cannot well be tested by a volume concerned almost exclusively with the poet's own moods. But so far as the movement of the inner individual beingand moods comes within the definition of the attribute, it is visible in "" Heine's Grave,"" which is, indeed, too dramatic in essence to be worth quoting in fragments.
We have enumerated what apDear to us the chief poetical merits of the book. - In considering its shortcomings we feel for the first time conscious of a regret that Mr. Arnold is its author, and thus forbidden, lwO fear, by les convenances, to analyze and pass judgment on his own work, as no one certainly could moro subtly, or would more impartially. For ourselves we are contented to note something of apparent effort, a want of spontaneity and naturalness, but, especially, a want of terseness. This want of terseness and compression is the most serious charge, except the one great charge of intellectual fastidiousness, to which this volume lays Mr. Arnold open as a poet. He touches, and retouches, not an expression, like Gray, but a thought, till all its pleasant angles get wern away. He never seems able to pursuade himself that his readers can be trusted to draw a moral or complete an antithesis, or, even with both premisses given, deduce a conclusion for themselves. And yet even this troublesome tendency would appear hardly to be somethinginseparable from Mr. Arnold's genius. It undoubtedly blunts the edge of many noble thoughts in "" Obermann Once More,"" and is the one fault of the poem on the Chartreuse. But in a sonnet he can be musical, yet brief and self-contained. ""Immortality,"" or ""The Good Shepherd with the Kid,"" would bear us out; but we quote in preference ""A A Picture at Newstead,"" as exhibiting in addition the power of telling a story, as well as suggesting its lesson, which is Mr. Arnold's specialty as a sonnetteer:-
"" What made my heart, at Newstead, fullest swell ?
'Twas not the thought of Byron, of his cry, "":Stormily sweet, his Titan agony;
""It was the sight of that Lord Arundel
""'Who struck, in heat, the child he loved so well, ""And the child's reason flickered, anrd did die. ""Painted (he will'd it) in the gallery
"" They hang; the picture doth tho story tell.
"" Behold the stern, mail'd father, staff in haud l "" The little fair-hair'd son, with vacant gaze,
""Where no more lights of sense or knoxvledge are ! ""Methinks the woe which made that father stand,
' Baring his dumb remorse to future davs.
""Was woo than Byron's woe more tragic far.""
There is one other very conspicuous characteristic, we do not say defect, of the volume. We hardly, indeed, know whether to rank it amongr its merits or its defects that it is impregnated with allUsions, literary and historical. There may, it is true, be danger of temptation to malke extravagant draughlts on the associations clustering about great names and famous memories, wvhen a poet seems gifted with power by the spell of a line, or a word, -"" Achilles pondering in his tent,"" "" The wizard Merliniin his forest grave,"" "" The walls whereByron came""-to conjure up aUlforl ' &Arthu,re, and Childe Hai-old, anld "" the tale of Troy divine,"" to follow in bis train. But Mr. Arnold's allusions are always so much to the purpose, tinting, but not obscuring, his own conceptions, that the audience to whom chiefly he speaks, and whose intelligence is flattered by the constant appeals to it, will not have the heart to complain that the atmosphere of the volume appears absolutely to rustle witlh the wings of invisible spirits from all the four corners of literature.
Our catalogue of MIr. Arnold's defects appears soon closed; and it may be supposed that we anticipate wide popularity for a volume displaying such gifts as thoso to which we have directed attention. We dare anticipate no such thing. He has melody, grace, and power of expression. Within his own limits, and for his own class, he even has
""Charm, the glory wbtich makes ""Song of the poet divine.""
It remains to be seen whether these qualities will tempt the public, outside Mr. Arnold's public, to brave Mr. Arnold's intellectual morgue, or whether
popular curiosity, if not sympathy, can be roused to watch the development of an intellectual type more purely academical than perhaps English poetry has ever yet been made to reflect.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS84059487/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=cf379869
Null,Locker's Poems.*,The Times,1865-Jun-06,"London, England","LOCKRR'$ POERM.*
. .oxonWi Miniatture Poets is the odd name under which some admirable selections from ou-r recent poetry. are now ofrerd to the world, We have a - selection from the works of Tennvson; a selection of the' best things in Browning; and now a selection. from the writings of one who is not -so well: known, but who-since he appeta in such companionship-nmust be greatlyl esteenie&,Tere he is known-Br. Frederick Locker. It is to tlu&liast'n,eutioned selection that we propose now in particulir ""o c'U ihe attention of our readers; but we may begin with a few words onf
tho series as wlhole. It has been much wanted, and I has been much run after. Our foremost poets have become voltuminous and fill ordinary readers with despair.. We can now carry about with us the best piece5 of Tennyson and Browning in a tmall a pocket volume. The publishers, however, have not beencontent to rest the claims of this miniature edition of the poets on the merits of good selection; they have mingled original poems with the solections, to as to give the new eaition an independent value. Thus, in tho miniature edition of Tennyson there is a new poem called""The Captain, a legend of the navy,"" and three new sonnets addressed to a coquette; but the volume is especiaUy curious as containing a version of one of the p oes finest songs which will be a surprise to all his readers. Who has not by heart thiiwonderful song in ThleFrincess?
""Thy voice is heard thro rolling drunms
""1 That beat to battle where he stands; Thy face across his fancy comes, ' S And gives the battle to his hands
""A moment, while the trumpets blow, "" He sees his brood aboutt ty knee; The next, like fire, he meets the foe,
""t na stdrikes him dead for thine and thee.""
Nothing can be finer. Every word is the right wordin the right place. Mr. Tennyson now presents us with a new version of this absolutely perfect song-a new version that will hereafter be quoted as one of the curiosities of literature
""Lady, let the rolling drums
"",Beat to battle whero thy warrior stands ""INTow thy face across his fancy comes, S And gives the battle to his hands. ""1 Lady let the trunmets blow,
""Clasp thy little babes about thy knee-
sNow their warrior father meets the foe,
""And strikes him dead for thine and thee.""
I1 Is (1incust to conceive of the two songs pro-
ceeding from the same brain; very difficult to
imagine how a poet of such taste as Mr. Tennyson,
who rarely makes a correction which is not an improvement, should give us this other version after the first. Such a freak of a really great poet gives to the new edition of the Laureate's works a curiosity of interest in addition to the value which it otherwise possesses as an admirable selection.
Mr. Frederick Locker, who now follows in the wake of the Laureate and of Mr. Browning, has a
genuine poetical gift, but he belongs to a peculiar class. In him is maintained the succession of that line of poets, from Suckling to Praed and Thackeray, whose effusions may perhaps best be described as masked poetry. The true feeling of the poet is masked with laughter. It is the poetry of men who belong to society; who have a keen sympathy with the lightsome tone and airy jesting of fashion ; who are not disturbed by the flippancies of smaU talk, but, on the contrary, can see the gracefulness of which it is capable; and who, nevertheless, amid all this froth of society, feel that there are depths in our nature which even in the gaiety of drawing-rooms cannot be forgotten. Theirs is the poetry of bitter sweet-of sentiment that breaks into humour, and of solemn thought that lest it should be too solemn plunges into lauginter. It is, in an especial sense, the verse of society. When society ceases to be simplo it becomes scepticaL Nor are we utterly to condemn this sceptical temper as a sign of corruption. It is assumeed in selfdefence, and becomes a necessity of rapid conversation. NVhen society is refined it begins to dread the exhibition of strong feeling, no matter whether real or simulated. If real, it disturbs the level of conversation and of manners, if simulated so much the worse. In such an atmosphere emotion takes refuge in jest, and passion hides itself in scepticism of passion. We are not going to wear our hearts upon our sleeves; rather thau that, we shall pretend to have no heart at all; and if, perchance, a bit of it should peep out, we shall hide it again as quicldy as possible, and laugh at the exposure as a good joke. If a lady in a baUroom finds that her back hair has escaped from the ligaments with which it is wonderfully and fearfully held together, the best she can do is to laugh; we may laugh at ourselves also when we give way to feeling and pass it off as a momentary weakness. In the poets who represent this social mood there is a delicious piquancy, and the way they play at bo-peep with their feelings makes them a class by themselves.
In this class M1r. Frederick Locker holds a good rank. He writes gracefully, andamidthe mockeries with which like the rest of his kind he amuses Us he shows just so much of his deeper nature as wiU establish between us a genuine sympathy, while we are stimulated and tantalized by the sauciness with1which when we are in full expectation of seeing emotion rise to its height he breaks into a smile, and seems to say that he was only jesting. This was the sort of temperament to which Mr. Thackeray had a strong leaning. He showed it in his own writing, andl he showed it in his appreciation of Mc. Locker, one of the best of whose poems he inasertedin one of the early numbers of the Co-nhill Magazin. These are the verses on a skul which proceed in the following strain:-
A human skull ! I bought it passing cheap 44It might be dearer to its first emplocyera; I thought mortality did well to keep
"" Some mute memento of the Old Destroyer.
""Time was, some may have prized its blooming skin
""HereUps were wooed perchance in transport tend'er; ""Some may have chucked what was a dimpled chin,
' And never had my'doubt about its gender! ""'Did she live yesterday or ages back?
"" What colour were the eyes when bright ancd waking? Ancd wvere your ringlets fair, or brown, or black,
"" Poor little head! that long has done with aching. 'It may have held (to shoot some random shots)
*' Thy brains, Eliza Fry, or Baron Byron's, ""The wit of Nely Gwynne or Doctor Watts,
""Two quoted bards! two philanthropio sirens !""
The rest of the poem, though by no means bad and though it indeed contains one vigorous verse, is
not equal in merit to these lines; and that deficiency reminds us that Mr. Locker's w ork is unequal. It is eight years since the first edition of London Lyrics was published, and we can trace a continual progress in the author's style since then; but he has much yet to do before his poems ciiu be accepted as finished works. And we insist upon this point because in the particular kind of poetry which Mr. Locker has attempted as most congenial to his tastes styl'e counts for much more than in any other kind. In other forms of poetry the fulness of the heart may excuse some roughness rof expression. In this the thing to be expressed is, so to speak, a jumble, a confusion of laughter and tears, sentiment mangled by scepticism. It is the business of the poet to make this mutilated sentiment endurable, therefore to smooth over the sense of mutilation by the finish of style, to reconcile the contradiction of passion and scoffing by the utmost delicacy of treatment that avoids alike roughness on the one hand ana commonplace on the other. The deadliest sin of all in such a style is commonplace. A poet pursuing a different style mnay lapse into commonplace in the intervals of greatpassion; but whenhemakesajestof feeling-pretends to make light of it, nothing can justi-f bim, nothing can save him from our re-
oaces but the sense that he hassgiven us a delicate substitute which is beyond theintermeddling of the commlonplace. -:
In the copy of this work, which has been sent to us, we have evidence of the auth9r'a carefulness. There is a pretty little poem called The Oiaszgc, the last line of w hich reads rather flat:-
""It ripened by the riveibank3,
""Where, mask and moonhgghtaiding, ""Dons Blas' and Juans play sad prauks,
""Dark Donnas serenading.
By loorish maiden it was plucked,
""Who broke some hearts they say then: By Saxon sweetheartit was sucked,
Who Mung the peel away then.
H Bow should she know in Pimilico, "" Or t'otber girl in Seville,
""That I should reel upon that peel,
"" And find iny proper leve""
In the copy of. Mr. Locker's work which nas reached us this last verse has a manuscript correction for which we must suppose the author to be responsible. It i3 a great improvement and wor-

' I saw her then, and now I see,
- Thongh cheerful and resign'd, still the

-She has-He gave it tenderly-
""Much faith-and carefully laid by
"" A little crutch.""
But it is needless to point out here the faultiness of execution. Some of the critics have remL.arked upon the poem in the beginning of the second verse, and have even praised it. it is n6 great matter; the poem is a very small one; but as Mr. Locker has a tendency to these calembourgs, we may ob3erve that punning is scarcely in accordance with the vein of poetry which he cultivates. The example of Hood is quoted in favour of it; but it is a mistake to suppose thatthis is Hood's style. The mistake is made because we see in Hood's mind a mixture of grave and gay. Hood could be very tragic and he could be very comical, but he never properly fused the two in his poems. Ie kept comedy and tragedy apart. There is no fun in ""E 1Eugeno Aram ;"" there is no emotion in -'Ben the Boatswain."" We have not the persistent battling in every page of the heart that feels with the spirit that mocks, which characterizes writers of the school of Mr. Locker. If Hood belonged to it, however, we might pardon a good deal to such amazing puns as he could put forth. Ir. Locker's puns, on the other hand, have nothing extraordinary in them to justify their existence, and have little more than the merit of alliteration. Talking of his old schoolfellows, he says
""; Poor Pat, who once did nlothing right,
""Has p roved a famous writer;-
"" While miat shirked praers (with aU his might),
"" And wear,. witha hi. ,,,e, X
There is no justification for puns such as these. We have not much to say against them. But as it was scarcely worth the while of the writer to invent them, he need not have disturbed his style by details which are not in keeping with it. And how do we prove that punning is not fit for this style ? We prove it in this way :-The essence of the style is irony-dissimulation as opposed to simulation. If, in the art of simulation, we pretend to be what we are not, in that of dissimulation we pretend not to be what we are. In the masked poetry of society, the singer pretends not to have a heart, which nevertheless continually peeps out. Now with this secret refined dissimulation, -which it is very ditficult to handle, it will not do to mingle the obvious and vulgar dissimulation of punning. The dissimulation of feeling cannot co-exist with the dissimulation of words. The sense of dissimulation should be kept down, andc that is not easy amid all the doubledealing of numerous puns.
Mr. Locker's dissimulation is that he is only a jester. His philosophy is summed up in threo of of his own lines:-
""If life an empty bubble be,
""How sad are those who will not see
""A rainbow in the bubble !""
And in another poem, which he has entitled 2lie Jester's Plea, he leads off in this fashion:-
""The world ! Was jester eyer in
"" A viler than the present? "" Yet if it ugly be--a sin,
"" It almost is-as pleasant!
"" It is a merry world (pro tem.),
""Andsomearegay,andtherefore -'eazs%them- but some condemn
"" The fun ti'_y do not care for. ""It is anugly world. 0.Gfnd
"" Good people-how the), wvrangle!
""The manners that they neve'rtenda! -
""The characters they mangle
""rThey eat, and drink, and scheme, anzd plod,
""And go to clurch on Snnday""And many are afraid of God-
""And more of Afrs. Grundy.""
But that he can do more than jest we prove by the graceful poem entitled To My Grandmothtr. It is the most finished piece in the volume, and, concluding our notice of Mr. Locker's poems with this extract,we doabt not that we leave a favourable impression of his powers on the minds of all its readers:-

Null,Praed's Poems.*,The Times,1864-Oct-07,"London, England","PRABRDS POEMS.*
There is a species of poetry which was more in vogue in ante-Reform Bill times than it is at tho present day-a poetry which bears somewhat the same relation to the sablime genius of Shakespeare or Milton, that Clodion, orFiammingo, or even the Dresden China shepherds and ahepherdeses of the last century do to the sculpture of Praxiteles or Michael Angelo. Smoothly written ters de aociitf,
where a boudoir decorum is always preserved, I where sentiment never surges into passion, and humour never expands into boisterous merrimentexquisitely rounded and polished,-such was tho kind of poetry by whichWinthrop MIaekworth Praed won his reputation. In his peculiar walk he has never been surpassed, but his walk has ceased to be popular. Perhaps this is partly owing to the fact that the taste of the present day is opposed to delicate sentinentalism, and that this sort of verse, except in the hands of a master of the art, such as was the subject of our notice, is apt to degenerate into the pretty inanity which, except in a very few songs-such, for instance, as "" I'd be a butterfly'characterizes the writings of the lateThomas Haynes Bayley.
Winthrop Mackworth Praed was the youngest son of Winthrop Mackworth Praed, seijeant-at.law, and for many years chairman of the Audit Board. He was born in London on the 26th of July, 1802. His mother died when he was about seven years old, but her place was well supplied by the care of an elder sister, and at eight years of age he was placed at Langley Broom School, near Colubrook, and after remaining there for four years was sent to Eton. At Eton his progress was rapid. From an early age he had shown a very remarkable poetic faculty, and his first efforts in English and Latin verse exhibit marked indications of the wit and fancy which were so conspicuous in his later writings. Some. of these pieces are to be found in the volumes beforeus, and they are interesting, inasmuch as they throw light on the formation of the author's mind.
In the year 1820 Praed set on foot the Apis Mat sa, and soon afterwards the tEonian. It is noon his contributions to the latter periodical that the brilliancy of Praed's early reputation was
founded, and is still maintained.|
PraedXi health was delicate, and his amusements were principally of an intellectual character. He was fond of chess, could beat all the boys of his own' age, and it in remembered that he was selected by a schoolfellow much older than himself-the celebrated Dr. Plsey, as an antagonist worthy of his skill. He stone in school theatricals, was exceedingly expert at the game of fives, and afterwards became an excellent tennis player. He was fond of whist, and spoke with effect at the debating society, and while still a schoolboy took a leading part in founding the Boys' Library.
Much was expected of Praed when he went to Cambridge in 1821. His scholarship was pre-eminently of the Etonian cast, and the following critical remarks by a friend of the poet are so much to the point that they ar given in his own words:-
""The character of Praedsratin and Greekerse Is peon.- lar. It is the exact translation, for the most part, of the same style and diction which he wielded with hardly greater ease in his native language. The same parkling antithesis, the same minute elaboration of fancy, whether employed in depicting natural or mental objects, and the mas aver present undercurrent of melaneholy are fonnd in both. Of a certain kind of Greek, adapted to the curious production caUed at Cambridge a Sapphic ode, and of a certain degree of Latin soholsrhip, competent toexprem alltheide3s necessarytohis verse, but not to sondthe depths, or exhaust the capacities of the language. he was master. His epigrams are, perhaps the most scholarlike of his productions in clasic verse - but it may be said of them all, what cannot be maid of many such exercises, that they were Greek and Latin poetry.'
The long list of Praed's academic honours proves that he worked hard at College. But he was no mere University bookworm. He was a constant speaker at the Union, where he was contemporary with Lord Macaulay; he cultivated generat literature, and mixed largely with his fellow atudents.
In the'autumnn of 1822 he became conneoted with. Mr. Charles Knight's Quarterly Magazine, and was soon its animating and directing spirit. Among the contributors were the Rev. John Moultrie, the Rev. Derwent Coleridge, (the author of the Memoir, excellent as far as it goes, from which these details are extracted), Lord Macaulay, Mr. Sidney Walker, and Mr. Nelson Coleridge.
The Quarterly Magazzne did not live long, and in 1826 a new periodical entitled the Brazcs Head was commenced by the same writers; however, notwithstanding the talent that Praed brought to its support, it failed to attract public attention, and it was abandoned after it had reached the third number. One of Praed'a most characteristic pieces "" The Chaunt of the Brazen Head,"" first appeared in this miscellany. We extract a few lines which are very felicitous. The poem contains many light touches of fancy and feeling.
""I think the studies of the wise,
""The hero's noisy quarrel,
""The majesty of woman's eyer,
"" The poet''s cherished laurel,
"" And all that makesual ean or fat,
"" And all that charms or troubles,-
""This babble is more bright than that,
""But stil they all are bubbls.
""I think that friars and their hoods,
""Their doctrines and their aggots, ""Havelighted up too many hoods,
""And far too many faggotsa
""I think while zealots fast ana frown,
""And fight for two or seven.
""That there are fity roads to town,
""And rather more to Heaven.""
The year 1825 found Praed once more atEton, as private tutor to Lord Ernest Bruce and it was during his second residence there tiat he commenced the series of poetical contributions to the magazines, &c., of the day, which form a considerable portion of the volumes before us.
He was called to the bar in May, 1829. He went tha Norfolk Circuit, and was rising, rapidly into practice, when, in 1830, he was returned to Parliament for the borough of St. Germain's, and again for the same place in 1831. In 1832, after the passing of the Reform Bill, he unsuccessfully contested the boroulch of St. Ives, and to this period, we believe, may be attributed many of his exccellent political squibs. Of this most difficult species of composition he is said to have been a consummate master. Hlispoliticalwritingsare not included in the present volumes, but Mr. Coleridge holds out the hope that they may hereafter be reproduced in a collected form.
In 1834 he was returned for Yarmouth, and about this time he was successfully employed by the Duke of Wellington to defend him in the columns of the Morning Post agyainst the attacks of some of the Liberal papers.
Under the Ministry of Sir Robert Peel, in 1834 and 1835, Praed held the office of Secretary to the Board of Control, and, during the latter years of his life, that of Deputy High Steward of the University of Cambridge.
In the sumimer of 1835, while his hopes of public advancement were yet high, he was most happily married to Helen, daughter of Mr. George Bogle. Little remains to be told. His health began to fail
in 1838, giving serious anxiety to his friends, and though the vigour of his mind and the interest which he continued to take in public affairs still supported him, he grew rapidly worse, and expired in his own house in Chester-square on the 15th of July, 1839. He addressed the following very touching verses to Mrs. Praed only a week before his death :-
"" To Hrnmz.
""Dearest, I did not dream, four years ago,
""W hen thro' your veil I saw your bright tear sbine, ""Caught your clear whisper, exquisitely low,
"" Aud fell your soft hand tremble into mine, ""That in so brief, so very brief a space
"" He who in love both clouds and cheers our life, ""Would lay on you, so fuln of light, joy, grace,
""The darker, sadder duties of the wife,-
""Doubts, fears, and frequent toil, and constant Care
"" For thisupoorframe, by sickness sore bested, "" The daily tendawnc on the fractious chair,
"" The nightly vigil by the feverish bed. ""Yet not unwelcome doth this morn arise,
"" Though with moregladsome beams itmIhthave chone Strengthof these weak hands, light of these dim eyes,
"" In sickness, as in health, bless you, my own."",
It is under the authority of his two daughters that the present collection of their gifted father's poems is given to the public.
The poems of Praed are an acceptable addition to
*The Poetiea2 Work-s of W7. A. Praed, M.P. Peae by a Memoir by the Rev. Derwent Coleridge, M.A., lt Principal of St. Mark's Colle-e, Chelesea Two vols., co I-oden: BdadAq9IC-Pvrarg. '
English literature; there iS nothing qiuite like thom in tho language, certainly nothing so good in their own way. As we said before, the poetry of Praed is not of a very higlh order but it has a depth and a delicacy which at first sight are hardly appreciated. He wrote in several styles; his most ambitious flights are not his best. It seems to us that he was most successful when he blended the humorous with the pathetic as in the following lines, where he speaks of ""sclhool and schoolfellows :""-
"" Whereae n; friends? I am alono;
""9 No rlamate shares my beaker:
Some lie beneath the churchyard stone, ""And some-before the Speaker; "" And some composo a trageay,
And some compose a rondto;
' And some draw sword for Liberty,
""And some draw pleas for John Doe.
"" For hours and hours I think and talk
"" Of each remeinbered hobby; I long to lounge in Poet's-walk, "" I whiver in the lobby;
""I wish tht I could run sway
"" From House, and Court, and Lev6%e ""Where bearded men appear to-day
""Just Eton boys grown heavy,-
""'That I could bask in childhood's sun,
"" And dance o'er childhood's roses,
""And find huge wealth in one pound one,
"" Vast wit in broken nose.
"" And play Sir Giles In Datchet-lane,
"" Andcald the milkmaids nHouris,That nd could be boy agains"" A happy boy,-at Drury's.
And aggain in ""My Little Cousinse:-
""You've not been introducead to Care,-
""Laugh on, laugh on to-day.
- "" Old Tia wi flin ' 'ils cioudes e long
"" Upon those sunny eves;
Tho voioe whose every word is song "" Will set itself to sighs;
""Your quiet slumbers,-hopes snd fears
"" Wil chue their rest away:
""To-morrow you'll be shedding tears,-
"""" Iaugh on, laugh on to-day I
""Iued to avea gl; d a ae,
""As shadowless a brow; J ""I once could run as blithe a raoe
""As you are running now;
""But never mind how I behave I
"" Don't interrupt your play;
""And tho' I look so very grave,
"" Laugh on, laugh on to-day!
These verses do not show the breadth of humour and deep pathos of Thomas Hood, but they are very charming An their way. They exhibit a most delicate handling, and there is a sweetness of temper about them which is, and always must be, very attractive.
There is a sparkling vivacity of expression in some of his lightest pleces, such as "" the Belle of the Bal,"" ""'Our Ball>' and ""A Letter of Advice,"" which render them inimitable. We give a short extract from the last, which is perhaps less well known than the two other exquisite piecea of airy banter
""If hestudies the news In the papers

""If he talks of the damps and the vapours

It would not be fair to compare Praed wkth Mr. Tennyson or the poets of the first class; but if Byron is the Rubens, Praed is the Watteau of Ensh poetry. Can we award him higher praise IFor did not Reynolds sy of Watteau that the French pssed a Correggio without knowing it. Like Watteau, he is the caposmo?a of his style. Each is stupendouis in his own walk, and what Horace Walpole said of Watteau may be applied with almost equal propriety to Praed:-
I He panted imagenarynymphs and swains, and described a kind of impossible pastoral, a rural life, led by thoso opposites of rural simplicity, people of rank and fashion. Watteau's shepherdesse_, na, his very sheep are coquettes, yet he avoided the glare and cUii7tant of his countrymen, and though he fell short of the dignified graee of the aItalians, there is an easy air in bis figures, and that more familiar ecies of the gracefol which we call eenteeL His nymphs are as much below the forbidding majesty of .goddesses, as they are above the hoyden awkwardnessc of scountrygrls. In his laltaand marches of cavalry, thecare-
less slouch of the soldiers stil retains the air of anDatloist aspires tobe agreeable as well as victorious""
Praed's mostnotable characteristic ishiselegance, ,but he is often coxcombical, and we are bound to say that he has more the air of an exquisite than of a fine gentleman. His coxcombry occasionally ininUates itself into his sentiment but even there it is never offensive. He has all the grace of Prior, andmuch of the vigour of Swift, with,the advatage of having lived in a more decorous age, and of possessing more refinement of mind.
The most important poem that Praed ever wrote is the "" Red wisherman ;"" it is so well known that it is not necessaryto quote it here. The versification. is as admirable as that of Thomas Ingoldsby's dief d'mu're, ""HamiltonTiPhe;"" while asa poem it is,perhaps? equalain power, it has almost as muchhumour, and infinitely more fancy and refinement. If the shade of Thomas Ingoldsby should feel hurt by this criticism let him take comfort in the reflection that he has amply avenged himself in his exquisite parody of Praed's, "" I remember, I remember,"" which certainly approaches thelimits of the namby. pamby, if it does not overstep them.
As a specimen of Praed's songs his ""Lord Roland "" is excellent, and no one ever equalled him as a writer of charades, the peculiar form of which he may be said to have invented. That on the poet Campbell is perfect.
Then we have the poem entitled ""The Vicar,"" hEich well deserves its popularity. How admirable isohi dpemsciveipin th eicneiio-ti

Three editions of Praeds' Poems have been published inAmerica They are all, necessarily, very imperfect, but still they reflect great credit on their respective editors, and, indeed, on the American people who demanded them. The first edition was published in 1852. It is very incomplete, for it contains only some 50 pieces, and those not all by Praed. Yet, curiously enough, 'nearly all Praeds best poems are to be found in it; and this is satisfactory, as showing that the best poetry remains in the memory, and( is not easily allowed to sink into oblivion. It is significaint that when only a portion of a poem is gven in the American edlition it is always thebet
We have the last American edition before us,. and among the verses attributed to Praed, buit 064hw ut~~ W o written by him. as
they do not appear in the present volumes, are fome lively couplets entitled "" Chivalry at a Discount."" We select one stanza as a fair sample of the whole, and should feel much obliged to the editor of this edition if he coiild inform us who wrote them, supposing Praed did not do so:-
""Yet weeping beauty mourns the time
"" When love found words in flowers;
""When softest sighs were breathed in rhyme,
""A And sweetest songs in bowers; Now wedlock is a sober thing-
""No more of chains or forge3!-
""A plain young man-a plain gold ring-
"" The curate-and St. George'x.""
Again, the ""' Sono' for the 14th of February,"" which was first pubsished in the New Monthly, in this edition eonsists only of eight stanzas, whereas, on reference, we find that four staiZas have been omitted. They are so funny and fantastical that we give them beow, and we are curious to know why they were not republished with the others.
""Alas I ere rm properly frinVic
With some such pure figment as this, ""Some visionx, not quite so romantic,
""Start up to demolish the bliss;
""Somue Will-o'-the-Wisp in a bonnet
"" Still leads my lost wits quito astray, ""Till up tomy ears in a sonnet
"" I sink upon Valentinie's Day.
""The Dian I half bought a ring for
""On seeing her thrown in the ring; ""The Naiad I took such a spring for
"" From Waterloo-bridge in the spring; ""The trembler I saved from a robber, ont
""M My walk to the Champs Elysees; ""The warbler that fainted at Oberon,
"" Three months before Valentine's Day. ""The gipsy I ouce had a spill winh,
""Baa luck to the Paddington team;
"" The Countess I bhanced to be ill with
"" From Dover to Calais by steamu;
"" The lass that made tea for Sir Stephen,
""The lassie that bringp in the tray, "" It's odd, but the betting is even
"" Between them on Valentine's Day.
"" Tho white hands I helped in their nutting,
"" The fair neck I cloaked in the rain,
"" The bright eyes that thanked me for cutting
""M vy friend in Emmanuel-lane;
"" The Blue that admires my Barrow;
"" The saint that adores Louis Way
""The nameless that dated from Harow
"" Throe couplets last Valentino's Day.""
There are several poems in the American edition which we believe were written by a Mr. Fitzgerald, such, for instance, as ""gHobblodehoys "" 4 A Letter from Miss Mortimer"" ""I Good Night 'J "" A Chapter of Ifs,"" &c. They are by no means tad verses, but besides being more or less imitations they lack the vigour and refinement of the master, and every now and then the cloven foot peeps out. But they contain some pretty lines, and there is a quatrain in "" Good night,"" which is very picturesque, and will dwell in the memory.
And I, while my cab in a shower "" Is waiting, the last at the door,
""Am looking aU round for the flower
"" That fell from your wreath on the floor.""
There are some exoellent verses in the Gem for the year 1831, called ""M Mars Disarmed,"" which should also have been included.
As we have already remarked, we do not think that Praed's longer poems are as successful as his shorter pieces; but they are aU full of admirable touches. He hadva keen perception of surrounding influences, as well as powers of minute observation, and he added to these a bright and abundant fancy. He had also a wonderful gift of verse, and this, with his fertility of expression, was almost a snare to him. He is occasionally too diffuse to satisfy the rigid critic.
Mr. Coleridge's memoir states taat after Praed's death he was spoken of by Lord Russell as a rising statesman, but we are inclined to think that, if he had lived, his chief reputation would stiU have been that of a poet. His gifts were such as might, in some measure, have disqualified him from shining in the sterner and more earnest career of politics, though certainly the possession of the same sort of ability did not prevent Canning from taking a first rank as a statesman.
It is possible that these volumes have appeared at rather an unfortunate time. Mr. Tennyson is justly considered the first poet of the day, and the tendencr of the-lesser poets is to imitate hin. He is admired by the publicevenforhis mannerisms; and It is not, therefore, likely that Praed, who is opposed to him in nearly every respect, will at once attain the positionto which he is entitled. Some day a reaction will set in, and another fashion wiiU be in the ascendant. Then Praed, with Iiis idiomatic terseness and pith_4is distinctness of thought and accuracy of expression, will, perhaps, be as unduly elevated as he may now be depressed; but both he and Mr. Tennyson, in their respective a:Ls, winl always be looked up to as genuine poets, and that of no mean order.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS134520647/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=5703fb99
Null,Tennysons New Poems.*,The Times,1864-Aug-17,"London, England","TBNsoNYON8 EW POE3LS.*~
In these times, when satirists tell us that poetry has died out, and that the most unsaleable of warer is a voliune of poems, the Laureate issues a little book whllich, although this is for publishers the dead season of the year, goes off like a praiirie on fire. Thouisands on thousands of copies of it are now in circulation over all Enlgdand. The young ones of our fainilies rushl to Tennyson as k the god of their idolatry; tho middle-aged, less enthusiastic, find that he is tlhe only living poet whom they care for: and the old folks, although they scarcely undorstand himn, and have soii1e doubts as to his rnetA s, are-anxious to witness this new appearance of one whoioccupies a fronit placeinumodernliterature. We re-erve any criticism which we may have to offer on the long-expected work till another opportunity, but this need not prevent us from at once satisfying, the curiosity of readers by giving them a short descriptioi andsome specimensof it. Thevolumeis toleraeoly well des.ribed in, the Anierican acvertisements as tdylts of the Hearth, a title under which it was at one time supposed thiat it would appear in this country. We refer to this title as vell enough indicating a lhomeliness of subject and of treatment which stands in contrast to the heroic outlines of the odyUs of the King. Two of these domestic Irlylls, one called Thtoch'Arde,t, the other Aylhnr s F ield, makle up more than half of the volumc. The former is tme story of unknown sin, one of thoso tragedies which the Greek mnind loved to dwvell tupon, and look into. Greek tragedy revolves in two cycles around tho tale of Troy and -the tale of Thebes. About thlat tale of Thebes-how CEdipus unknown to himself came to murder his father and marry hiis mother-heaps of tragedies lhave been written. Christian art on the other hand has avoided the questions raised by the fact of unknown or unconscions guilt, and MIr. Timnyson, in the first of liis tales, touches it with a light hand. Enoch A?rden is the story of a ,woman who commits bigamy without knowing it, the name of the tale being derived from the na-me of her first husband, who, having lived abroad as a sort of Robinson Crusoe, on a far away island, for about a dozen years, comes home an old broken mnan to find his wiife the wife of another, his oldl schoolfellow Philip Ray. Lonig years of solitudl e had, of courvse, much altered E1noch Arden, and the poet describes hima wvaiting alnd longing in Lis distant island as follows:-
"" The mountain wondc(l to the pasa, the lawns
"" And winding glales high up like ways to Heaven, "" The slender coco's drooping crown of plumes,
The lightning flash of insect and of bird, T""'rie lustre of the long convolvulses

He busied himself about the place, took any jobs that offered, and so held on to life for about a year longer. He then died, but not till ho died did he divulge who he was to those about him. Mr. Tenpyson touches tile subject so lightly that he vaytsothing of the effect of Arden's dying confession on his bigamous wife. He leaves that entirely to the ima,gination.
The story of Aajlmvei's Field, the other Idyll of considerable length, is less original. It is the old story which 31r. Thackeray mado so much of and -which furnished some of the incident of Maud-of ,- _

Mr. Tennyson, of course, cannot write anything which is not rarely worded, and this story of Aylimer's Field WrI be read again and again for the felicities of diction with whichl it abotulds. Here, for example, is the description of the bringing up together of Leolin Averill and Edith Aylmer,-
"" Sanguine lie was: but a lces vivid hue
Than of that islet in the chestnut-bloom
""Flamed in Iiis cheek; and ea-er eyes. that still ""Took joyful note of all things 'oyful, bean'd ""Beneath a manelike mass o? rolling gold,

Also the strange recondite suggestivenes3 of the lines about the passions that

The next Idy]l, S'ea dreams, we imagine that we have seen before in one of the Magazines. We quote the followving description of a character from it
""With all his conscience and one eye agkew, ""So false, he partly took himself for true -
""Whose pious talk, when most bis heart was dry,
""Made wet the crafty crowsfoot round his eye; Who, never naming God except for gain, ""So never took that useful name in vain ;
""Made Him his catspaw and the Cross his tool,
""And Christ the bait to trap his dntpe and fool; ""Nor deeds of gift, but gifts of grace he forged,
Andsnakelike slimed his victim ore he gorged; And oft at Bible mcetings, o'er the rest ""Arising, did his holy oily best,
Dropping the too rough H in HIell and Heaven,
To spread the Word by which himself had thriven. ""How likeyou this old satire I""
Then come two companion poems which are adnmrable stuidies, each of its kind. The Grandmother has been published in one of the Magazines, and we leave it alone. The companion picture is a novelty, which we quote entire:-

Null,Professor Aytoun on Poetry and Dramatic Literature,The Times,1853-Jun-06,"London, England","PROEBS5OR AYTOUZV on POETRY and
DRAMA TIC LiTERA TURE.
Our eloquent and impassioned visitor from the far north has come and gone. He has found no churlish welcome in these soutnern parts. Fashion and beauty have hung upon his syllables, and an auidience, almost too delicate and refined to appreciate the Caledonian fare that has been set before them, have at least expressed their heartiest approval of the unexpected dish to which they have been treated. The Scottish minstrel has nothing to complain of. He may return to his native heather, seize his harp, summon his clansmen, and sing to them of the victory won over Saxon earls and blue-eyed maidens, descended from chiefs who once did battle with the Bruce. For ourselves, we acknowledge the grace of the genius that gave us for our delight the Lays of the Scottislh Cavaliers., We were of the firas to welcome the manly strains, and are-not disposed now to withdraw our spontaneous praise. But Mr. Aytoun is not only a successful poet, but also a learned professor. In the morning, when he is at home, he writes inspiriting verses for the world at large. In the afternoon he quietly descends from Pegasus-a very Shetland in his build and strength of limb-puts on his spectacles, and gravely lectures to the ingenuous youth of Edinburgh upon Rhetoric and Belles Latres. What if he has come among us, leaving half of his intelligent self in the Scottih capital, and that the very half which he was bound in common honesty to bring along with him? We have diligently attended the interesting and clever readings of Mr. Aytoun, and we must own that not on one occasion have we been fortunate enough to meet with the professor. The Scotch poet day after day has taken forcible possession of our ears, but the instructor, for all we know to the contrary, has been fast asleep in his Edinblurgh chair, taking needful refreshment after the laborious duties of the University session.
Mr. Aytoun has a poetic theory. He expounds it; but his exposition is delivered, enforced, and illustrated, not with the calm judgment and well balanced independence of a teacher, but with the impetuous and daring partiality of a devoted partisan,; and hence, though there is undoubted truth in his utterance, it is so mixed with unquestinnable error that we are but performing a necessary duty in briefly calling attention to the mistake which all Mr. Aytoum's hearers are likely to commit, if, upon the faith of the distinguished lecturer, they resolve benceforwardto look-upon-the broad field of literature from the only point of view at which he allows them to regard it. The substance of Mr. Aytoun's position is simply this :--Poetry is not poetry unless it be addressed to the ear; and even then it does notfulfil itsmission unlessthe ear be that of the common people. This is the definition. The national songster completes the syllogism by a very summary proces3. The Scotch ballads are addressed to the ear of the common people; therefore. the Scotch ballads constitute the only genuirie poetry in the British isles. If this be not the view of the latest of the Scoteb minstrels, we are puzzled to ascertain what other different view he laboured to impress upon the minds of his listeners.
The manner in which throughout the lectures this theory was illustrated was as 2ijef as the theory itself. Whenever Air. Aytoun thought it necessary to recite a ballad, he took care to select one of the noblest and most stirrino in the lan-guage, and to declaim it with all the emphasis and fervour at his command. Whenever he deemed it expedient to rehearse poetical compositions of any other sort, he generally exhumed the most worthless, and sent them forth with the shabbiest recommendation his voice could give them. Not, indeed, that he told
ou outright and in so many words that the verses were wretched and unworthy your regard. Not he! The professor is too far north for that. On the contrary, he professed vast esteem for the writers of the poems in question, and introduced them into that fashionable assembly at Willis' Rooms as dear friends whom he had long known, and whose acquaintance he should be sorry to dispense with. We have a dstinct recollection of the affectionate manner with which, for example, he presented to their Ladyships a most intimate and esteemed acquaintance who flourished in the Elizabethan period, and whose greatest fault was that he had imitated too closely the fancifuil style of Spensera poet, himself, much too fanciful for the upholder ef the paramount claims of the Scottish minstrelsy. No wonder the ladies tittered when they saw the gentleman. His hat was over his eyes, his nankeen trowsers did not reach to his half-boots, his coat sleeves were hanging over his hands down to his knees, and his toes were turned in. "" This, ladies and gentlemen,"" said the courageous professor, "" is my valuedfriend, the Spenserian poet. Respect him for my sake, and cutivate his society."" Not a smile was on the professor's countenance, though his tongue was in his cheek. Well, we cannot say-we have never seen a duke in the uniform of Dusty Bob; but his Grace could hardly look more ridiculous in the costume than British poets appeared when dragged to light, from time to time at Wil is' Rooms, by their obliging friend, the Professor of Rhetoric and Belles Letres in the University of Edinburgh.
""I do not try to do what I could not,"" exclaimed Professor Aytoun, with much manliness, during one of his earlier lectures; "" I do not seel; to hide mly Scotch accent from you. Take me as I am."" Let it be so, and we shall love the man; for we all love
ationality, true genius, high courage, noble sentiments, audgraceful utterance. Certainly we caunot consent to take our late accomplished visitor for what he is not. It -was pardonable-it was moreit was heroic in the Scotch professor to deliver his lectures on poetry and dramatic literature before an EIdinbuirgh audience, and to treat half the illustrious names known to English literature with comparative contempt, wvhile he was placing Scott upon apedestal just lower than that of Shakspeare, but higher far than those of Chaucer, Milton, Spenser. AVe will add that it was a daring if not a desperate act to repeat, without the alteration of a line, in the broad streets of London, doctrines originally intended for a select and sympathizing audience, less solicitous for the fame of dead English poets than for the glorification of their own beloved and classic land. BIut heroism and coiuage are one thing, and true criticism is another. The former Professor Aytoun has exhibited in abundance; the latter we take leave to say we have yet to receive at his hands. His lectures are not lectures upon poetry and dramatic literature, but upon the excellence of ballad poetry, interspersed with occasional remarks, just and unjust, upon the English writers. It is ctirious to observe that, in the course of these lectures upon English poetry, Paradise Lost was scarcely referred to, even by name; Chaucer was introduced -with au apology; Pope with condemnation; Ben JonsonNithpity; Beau montandFEletcher with an accusation that they never wrote a line with a love for their art, Moore with a rebuke for his Eaqtern stories; and all the dramatists, from Massinger down to Congreve and Farauhar, with indiguation and contempt. The Scotchmen alone have no blots -upon their pages. Scott will endure as long as true poetry is understood; Campbell is faultless; and they who wrote the ancient ballads are of course immortaL This is the gist of the six lectures just delivered in London; but we warn the
brilliant auditory to beware how they take the Iinstruction home without further counsel and advice. This Edinburgh laddie hath a fascinating style; but I he wrote the Bon Gautier ballads as well as the Scottish lays, and is as sharp at satire as he is sweet in song.
One word as to his theory. There can be little doubt that the professor utters a broad and general truth, when he asserts that poetry should. be written as if it were meant mainlv for the ear and heart, and not for the eye and intellect of the listener. The music of a poem is as essential to its acceptance as perfume to the flower. The first poetry was recited bythe poetto his audience, and this origin should never be lost siglt of as characteristic of the art; a *true poet will frame his verse under the consciousness that it is to be pronounced with passionate emphasis in ears that are constrained to hear by the melody and power of the music. Sympathy between the poet and his readers is maintained only by a_ vivid progress of passion, and can be protracted only to the degree that the former imagines that others are lingering on his lay. But is there no music in the organ tones of Milton, in the exquisite strain of ;3penser, in the happy and exuberant verse o Tlhomas Mfoore? I:Es there no passion but the vehement and turbulent? The passion of the poet isa-strongpossessing affection, alivewith pleasure aUd pain, and specifically, Moved by the theme or occason. Will the professor of Belles Lfres insistthat,in order to exhibit this affection,itis absolutely necessary for the poet to be in a passion himsnelf, and to lay about im liEke a fighting man in
the battle of the Harlaw? There is passion and music enough ii Coleridge's Gen2eieve, but the passion is deep, penetrating, subdued, and thrilling; and the flow of the melody that lingers upon the drchaimed ear long after- the verse stops is as the murmur of waters in the mountain brook-a sound giving life, form, and beauty to pervading silence,
-We admit-the efficacy of passion in rousing, quicken.- ing. strengthening, aud even illuminating the intellectual functions; but let not Mr. Aytoun attempt to persuade us that we shall look in vain for such passion in the works of those iUustrious English poets who have so largely helped to build up tha intellectual glory of our common country; but that i; is the property-sole, entire, and indisputable_ of the Scottish ballad writers.
It is also true enough that poetical compositions should be addressed, as Mr. Aytoun insists, to thee ears of the people; but *hat does he understand when he speaks of "" tae people ?"" Mr. Cobden clamours sometimes for the rights of the people, but -when we closely inquire into :the meaning of his words we find that his clients conLstitute only a very limited section of the community at large. Thet
Scoteh professor falls into the sam.e mistake. Het talks of the ear of the people when he simply meau the popular ear, and he never in his life gave expression to a greater error than when he declarecl fromI his desk, that all poetry ceases to be worthy of its name the instant it ceases to recommend itself to, the. uncultivated imaaination. When Mr. Aytoua criticised the poems of Wordsworth, he justly condemned the puerilities of that great poet, and took occasion to observe that there are subjects too meau for the art. of the poet to deal with. May there not be subjects, images, and thoughts too loftv for the vulgar to comprehend ?- Is the lowest unlolding of mind competent to judge the highest ? Carry the proposition, to its furthest limit, and to what conclusiondowe arrive? If the popular ear be the -arbiter and judge of the poet's faculty, not only must the poet's wvo:k, as a -rhole, find popular favour, but every thought, word, and tone must be brought down anld meted to the popular standard -an oppressive subjugationof art, against which the voiceof civilizationunequivocally criesout. Theoffice of all art is to extend and raise the intellectual vision; the function of the poet, especially, is to exalt his listeners while they are taking hiis strains into their hearts. In the world, he spiritualizes men as religion spiritualizes them out of it. Therefore, in fact, ,poetry exerts a constant antagonism to the merely popular mind; but the conflict is sublime, for victory gained on the one side is productive of nothing but advantage and self-respect on the other.
If the whole of Mr. Aytoun's lectures are carefully read-and we hope he will publish them, for the advantage of those who did not hear them delivered-it w,ill be found that the style of reasoning indicated above pervades aU these compositions. Truth is spoken, but not truth enough; full justice is done to the species of poetry vhich it is the delight of the lecturer himself to cultivate, but sufflcient justice is not rendered to the poetic styles wvith which his genius has no established relations. :E[e is more Scottish than British-more national in his tastes than universal in his sympathies. He has a poet's soul, but he is swayed by the prejadices of a. class. If he were a Jacobite or a Covenanter, he would die for his Sovereign or his faith. Let us not wonder that he is unscrulpulous in his defence of his poetic prejudices and prepossessions. Earnestness is not too common a virtue now-a-days. In politics and in poetry the professor is passionate to a fault-but the fault is amiable, and criticism involuntarily applauds even while it deliberately condemns.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS33851590/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=20cab7a5

WI' aflirme the other day, that poetry is iot extinct i lEngland. We might have said the same thin 6f stage-coach travelling. The eye and soulI of the traveller are still occasionally roused, as if from a dreatn, by the visible presence of a Jehu, not wholy givenup to tin-and-water and despair,
fdo amiar box, respectable, wholesome-looking, solemn as the last man, and pursuing'his vocation as steadily as in the days of yore when the spirit of the age was innocent of all design against him. Poetry is still among us,' but 'the precious flower is scarce. Steam, electric telegraphs. ggantic victories over time and space, and over the physical impediments of naturemighty poetic achievements themselves !-have rendered usimpatient of purilities and content with no versification but the highest, and of that commodity the supply is smaul. Here and there you have a glimmering of genius, always welcome and potent in its operations, but the general atmosphere is dark. If versHiers -would know the temper of the people in this regard, let them take their wares to the publishers of London, and ask the dealers the intrinsic value of the stuff. We will not afflict the amiable vendors by anticipating the reply. Yet have we not ceased to appreciate sterling metal. It would be a contradiction, indeed, if an age that will be remembered hereafter for its sublime discoveries and huge practical developments should be open to the reproach of insensibility to beauty in its piirest forms. If publishers shrink wit]h affright from mediocrity, they still doff the cap to excellence. Another Thomas Moore would be a welcome visitor in Patlenoster-row, and a second Byronif he be %pong uB-has a second John Murray ready-made to his hands. The writings of Wordsworth at this hour act upon the springs of thinking in all minds competent to reason and to learn, and a worthy successor of the poet of Rydal Mount would not lack the substantial rewards secured by the author of The Excursion in virtue of his poetic labours. Because we have no stomach for gooseberry wine, let it not be said that we are insensible to the flavour of nectar.
Tennyson has no ground of complaint against the age he lives in and adorns. His fame is brought home to him in the unmistakeable and pleasant form of abundant coin of the realm. Yet Tennyson has affectations of thought, feeling, and expression unworthy his genius and fatal to his influence. Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton writes long poems, and in his prefaces tells us exactly what poetry should be. We turn to the poems ,themselves, and discover what poetry is not. Browning, who has his admirers, must laugh in his sleeve at the credulity of man, while he audaciously presumes upon its existence. The author of Festus pours upon the world a flood of murky water upon which float gems that dazzle by their brilliancy and astonish by their value. We hold it a miracle that Mr. Bailey, who flings occasionally, but only too rarely, at our feet stars that merit a lIace in the sky for ever, has patience and blood sufficiently cold to indite hundreds of pages of the foggiest metre that ever distressed the prosaic mind and touched with unaffected sorrow the soul of the true lover of poetry. This writer, however, stands at the head of a class which is, we fear, daily increasing, and from whose conspiracy against common sense the worst consequences may be dreaded. Few modem versifiers, indeed, give proof of the requisite poetic susceptibility revealed at times in the otherwise dreary poem of Festus; but nearly all of them show the same daring and prevailing contempt of sobriety and truth. Because an express-train travels at the rate of sixty miles an hour, Pegasus is surely not required to fly a thousand miles a minute. If the former has annihilated our notions of space, we do not ask the latter to kick out of our brains all ideas founded upon reason. The 'Lshion of throwing dust in the eyes of those whose brains are deemed impenetrable to sober verse can never answer in the long run. It may blind and confound the weak, but the strong it will simply excite to merriment and scorn.
Mr. Fane is not to be charged with such extravagancies; and, although his verses by no means indicate powers of the highest kind, there is so much unquestionable evidence of poetic feeling in many of his compositions, and he evinces so commendable a disposition to write sensibly and truthfully upon the topics he has selected for poetic illustration, that we hold it right to give encouragement to an effort made for once in the right direction. His little volume is full of promise; the fountain of song is fresh within him, and we are convinced that care and culture only are required to give vigour and high purpose to the current. If we miss in Mr. Fane's verses the luxuriant imagery of Keats, we are not offended by the wildness and exuberance which in that gifted man degenerated into grotesque extravagance, and in the tribe of his imitators assume the character of utter nonsense. Thought is the basis of Mr. Fane's poetry, and the language in which it is poured forth is natural at all times, and occasionally strikes with a singular power of melody on the ear. We recommend the youthful author-for young his writings indicate him-to eschew publication for a while, and to submit to that self-discipline without which excellence is rarely achieved, and underwhose control genius is best able to stamp its character on the general mind. There is such a fault as spoiling a good crop by a too eager desire to reap the harvest. Mr. Fane may avoid the evil by abstinence and industry. Let him instruct his muse, and render it familiar with the triumphs of England's great masters of verse; he may keep himself aloof from the danger of servile imitation by looking upon external nature and into his own spirit with the poetic eye with which he is endowed, and which constitutes his safest guarantee for independence and originality.
Scanty is the number of our genuine poets, and we would willingly rescue one for the coming generation, which threatens to be barren of the commodity.

Null,"The Princess, A Medley.-By Alfred Tennyson.*",The Times,1848-Oct-12,"London, England","THBEPINCESS, A MEDLBY.-B, ALFRED
TENNYSON.*
: _~~~~~.4 M
Stand forth, Alfred Tennyson. Rise from thy sofa; lay aside thy cigar; come and give an account of thy misdoings againstthe majestyof poetry. Dost thou plead guilty to three volumes of musioal mysticism of which thou art indicted; or,dost thoucry ""not guilty,"" set up a justification, and throw thyself upon the country ? Well, be it so. Thou shalt be tried by thy peers.
It must have been a marvellously green and fertile age, when it could be affirmed, "" Quot homines tot sententie."" Ever since then the ratio between men and opinions has been altering, population expanding, eriginal thought decreasing, until in this more than iron age five ideas wiU serve on a moderate computation for SOO men. As one consequence of this position, our first glance at a book is like our first look at a child to see whom it is most like-whence is to be traced each separate feature of its face-whence derived its port, its power, and its expression. We knew a youthful enthusiast who believed that no combination ef character could exist that was not already described by Shakepere; and therefore his first act, after being introdaced to a stranger, was to reach from his shelf those mighty volumes and hunt them through, as a botanist does his Flora to identify a new found wild flower. We do not therefore say-
""Had'st thou a father; had'st thou a mother?""
For that part of a book's physiology is too well known to need the question, but we proceed at once to its genealogy.
Tennyson does not write at all like Milton.- Agreed. His is not the style of Pope.-Conceded at once; yet he must have had progenitors, and he has already offspring. There is even a Tennysonian school, and Browning and Mies Barrett have sat at his lecture. "" What say you,"" asks one, "" to Shelley, filtered into Keats, and racked off into Tennyson2."" Why, we answer, if any reader thinks to find, in the last-mentioned, a "" Family Shelley,"" or a ""KEeats for the use of Schools,"" they wilt be disappointed; although now andl then lineament and look do discover that both those poets have been in the family tree of Tennyson's verse.
There is one mark about Tennyson and his followers by which they distinguish themselves from the last generation of worshippers at the Castalian fount-they look forwards, not back. Like Mrs. MIalaprop, all their reminiscences are to the future. Tennyson chooses to float on and with the age. He wishes to move with the mass of his fellow-beings, whithersoever their habits and their modes of thinking may be migrating. He docs not care to fight backward through the onward crowd, or groan for the good old days. Be finds the present good, and the future likely to be better. If he is saddened, it is with such a thought as this:
""Wll tfiirty seasons render plain
"" Those lonely lights that still remain, "" Just breaking orer land and main 2""
He sees the glowworm begin to "" pale her ineffectual fire,"" and his sympathies are with those who will hail the fullness of a new intellectual day. Nor in this does he utter dove-like mournings, hut he healthily girds up his loins, and adds his voice to the voice of the multitude-only, being a poet, and they but men, he strives to mingle music with the general cry.
Other oharacteristics of Tennyson are his suggestiveness; his sensuous appeal to the mind through euphonous metres and rhythm; his prodigality of images and pictures. In this latter partioular his resemblance to Shelley is easily traced. In the poetry of both, like sunlight and olouds quick drifting over aR April landscape, field and homestead, grove fountain and silver watercourse, are touched by light and left. The clay is seized for an image,- and, while half formed from the plastic mass, the model is thrown down to make way for another conception. It is the wayward hand of the minstrel upon his harp, when, wrapt from men, his thick-coming fancies fleet before his sight, almost too rapidly to ""leave the whispering of a name behind.' Coleridge was king of this kind. In Kutbz Kh7an his mellifluous voice is indistinctly heard striving to express the evanescent images of an opium-dream. It is pure peetry, abstractedfrom the reasoning mind. But we cannot deny or conceal the fault in Tennyson, or Shelley either, that imperfection waits on this lavish production of ideas; nor the more objectionable vice of purposed obscurity. Here, too, Coleridge must be joined with the other malefactors while CriWabel, in sphynx-like beauty, stands accusing him for ever. Poetry may be highly suggestive and far removed from all that is matter-offact, yet not involved with dislocations of grammar or vagaries of diction. ""Nor,"" says Sir Egerton Brydges, "" is affected drea-miness and mysterious intelligibility the strain of the real muse. Inspiration speaks clearly, and is the oracle of truth.""t In reading Tennyson, one is constantly startledbyhalf-formed images; hybrids, begotten by fancy upon modem facts and material objects. These produce in the reader's mind correspondent i!npressions, imperfect, ineffable, inarticulate murmurs from the legion within to the wizard's muttered incantation without. How canthe image onthewatersbe clear when the object they reflect is broken and obscure ?
If we were the embodiment of the Etching Club, we would illustrate Tlw Two Voices throughout, verse after verse. It is Tennyson's best poem; and, however great may be its native or affected indistinctness, he supports himself long on the wing, and comes homo well and truly to his ultimate destination. His course is not, indeed, straight and unwavering like the bee's at evening to her hive, but rather like the kingfisher's wayward and exstatic flights; yet the bird knows his nest, and is true to his flowery-margined stream. The poem is composed in rhyming triplets ; not the terza rinea of Dante, which Shelley has adopted in Prince Athanase, and other pieces, without much effect. It paints the obstinate battle in man's heaxt between the good and evil principles. In the hour of natural depression, at the ebb of the spirits' tide, despair approaches his victim-not novw, indeed, as the ""blatant beast,"" roaring, rending, and treading all under foot; but, sitting like Iago at the Moor's ear, he pours in the poison of specious reasoning and pretended commiseration. Ievertheless, the tempter's first question.-
""Thou art so full of misery,
"" Were it not better not to be ?""
is aver bold, and awakens an immediate answer. The reply of the bettervoice leads to a more exposed point of attack. The whole universe is to be weighed against the atom man. The innumerable orders of life are arrayed, and against them is confronted one individual of one species. The infinite past andcfuture are, as it were, by an awful paradox, to measure the duration of mortal man, that flower of the field, that cloud of the early morning. The asswers of the better voice are fainter, and choked with sobs. Still it fights on, though driven from post to post, as each pillar of philosophy to which the warrior clings gives way under the pressure of the conflict. And when the impressiveness of nature weighs upon our spirit-when we have spent a day over the microscope, and have discovered life within life, and all that we touch to be but a ptenum of vitality-then, at night's approach, changed instruments, and directed our telescope to the heavens, gazing, past the stars, on the nebulous light of other systems-when we feel ourselves standing a mere point between two infinities-then what answer can be given to the appalled soul, save the dogmatic answer of unquestioning faith; what rest is there for the spirit of man, but with child-like trust to lay his head on the pillow of infinite love and close his eyes in hope? At one moment the soul militant seizes on the Pythagorean scheme, but its invalidity is at once apparent, because it is obliged to use the opposite argument to Wordsworth's, which aflirms that
""Not in entire forgetfulness,
""And not in utter naledness,
""But trailing clouds of glory do we come ;""
and to allow that oblivion attends the ""slipping through from state to state,"" so that all personality or identity vanishes. Even here the same yearning for the advancement of our race breaks out,-
""Were this not well, to bide mine hour,
"" Though watching from a ruin'd tower, ""How grows the ay of human power?""
Finally, when the reasoning of the head well nigh succumbs to the suicidal arguments of despondency, the battle is turned by the reasoning of the heart. While intellect grew faint, and could scarce make any longer a show of resistance, there remained an instinct in the bosom uncrushed and unsubdued. It was the love of life and the life of love that, like the prisoner's little flower, pressed uDward into sight between the stones of his cell, orthe spire of mos3 that saved Mungo Park from yielding himself up to death on the desert sands. The sight of human affection, calm, pure, and sunny, the interchabged love of a child and its parents, as they walked to-

In Lockstey Hall the full energy of the poet of advancement iB in play. In the deep wounds of the affections, to escape the preEent he throws himEelf upon the future. He gives up all the past, when he flings threats andi bitter taunts at his shallow-hearted love, and prophesies her mental recession to the lowerlevelof her preferred saitor. As the troubled torrent ef a mountain stream the verse rashes on, and the flowers of fancy mingle confusedly with indignation and scorn the pang of the present and the wild prospect of co 1 g ages.
There is xeal poetry in (Enone, and sweet wild music in the La4 of Shalkot, albeit that the name of the latter calls to mind recollections of beefsteaks, rather piquant than odorous. Tennyson adds colour to form in his classical groups. In (Euona he clothes our own feelings with the garments of Greece. His manner is not to dig up dismembered ruins and set up the cold skeleton in our every-day.haunts, but to lead us by the hand suddenly into the genial and glowing climate of Ionia, where shading the eyes with our curved [palm we see through the ruddy day
""Beautiful Paris, evil.hearted Paris
""Leading a jet-blackgoat white-horn'd, white-hooved, comine
"" up from reedy Simois aU alone.""
When we read the Lady of Shakaet. we hear a voice beside us chanting in low tones a fitful melody. It is pure, sensuous poetry. We forbear to ask too closely what hidden meanings divell in ita misty dreaminess. We would not for the world break""our toy to discover its concealed music.
The two volumes of poems have been before the public for several years. Taken as a whole they were rather the first fruits of a new mind, the presage of a future, than that on which our author was to ibuild his reputation. It was better to askc, certainly, ""Why does not Tennyson publish more6 "" than ""Why has he published so much ?"" There was a tacit expectation among many that he would give to the world a poem worthy to follow those lyrical and detached pieces in which many beauties and much vigour were mixed with and abated by many faults and affectations. There has been time for his mind to mature itself, and his style to be pruned and chastened; time for the plan of a greatpoemto be oarefully digested and elaborated. Bat, alas! that expectation is not fulfilled in the appearance of T& Princess. The faults remain unchanged, the affected singularities of style are more numerous than before. Pity that where feeling and fancy and the poetic temperament are so strongly manifested, an author's care for his fame should be too slight to use those gifts with discaretion-to set his jewels in consistent workmanship. Must we come to the conclusion that we have seen the extent of his power, or are we to hope still for nobler efforts ? The first pages of Thk Ptincess really seem introduced tD deter readers from going farther in the book; yet, having crossed the rabicon of a dozen pages, mach beauty and vigour is to be found scattered throughout a plan very fantastic, and impaired by a style often unintelligible. The fourth and seventh cantos are the best portions of the Medley.
It is our hearty wish that Tennyson may be even new working at his forge to produce a great and permanent work. To disuse his talent is a crima in the possessor of it, and a wrong to the community.",https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS50626380/TTDA?u=uppsala&sid=bookmark-TTDA&xid=65559044
